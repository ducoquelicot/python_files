                     N. INSURANCE. CONTRACTOR, at its sole cost, shall purchase and maintain in full

                         requirements of this section. The procuring of such required policies of insurance
                         shall not operate to limit CONTRACTOR's liability or obligation to indemnify CITY
                         under this Agreement.

                        fees and disbursements that any of them may suffer form or incur and that may
                        directly or indirectly arise and/or result from either Party's gross negligence or
                        willful misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary

                        certifies that it is aware of the provisions of the Labor Code of the State of

                        by giving sixty (GO) days' prior written notice thereof to CONTRACTOR. If

                        Agreement, in addition to all other remedies provided by law, the City Manager
                        may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice of termination.
                        Upon receipt of such notice of termination, CONTRACTOR shall immediately
                        discontinue performance. CITY shall pay CONTRACTOR for services satisfactorily

                         sustained by CITY due to CONTRACTOR's failure to perform its material
                         obligations under this Agreement.     Upon termination, CONTRACTOR shall

                         completed, prepared by CONTRACTOR or given to CONTRACTOR, in connection
                         with this Agreement. Such materials shall become the property of CITY.

                     S. ASSIGNMENTS/CHANGES.            This Agreement binds the parties and their
                         successors and assigns to all covenants of this Agreement. This Agreement shall
                         not be assigned or transferred without the prior written consent of CITY. No
                         amendments, changes or variations of any kind are authorized without the
                         written consent of CITY.

                         that it presently has no interest, and will not acquire any interest, direct or
                         indirect, financial or otherwise, which would conflict in any manner or degree
                         with the performance of this Agreement. CONTRACTOR further covenants that,
                         in the performance of this Agreement, it will not employ any person having such
                         an interest. CONTRACTOR certifies that no CITY officer, employee, or authorized
                         representative has any financial interest in the business of CONTRACTOR and
                         that no person associated with CONTRACTOR has any interest, direct or indirect,
                         which could conflict with the faithful performance of this Agreement.

                         the subject of this Agreement. Any variance in the exhibits does not affect the
                         validity of the Agreement and the Agreement itself controls over any conflicting
                         provisions in the exhibits. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
                         representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings whether oral or

                          the event that funds are not appropriated for the following fiscal year, or (b) at

                          portion of the fiscal year and funds for this Agreement are no longer available.
                          This Section shall take precedence in the event of a conflict with any other
                          covenant, term, condition, or provision of this Agreement.

                         At the request of CITY, acting by its project manager, CONTRACTOR and its listed

                     B. Fair Value Commuting Custom Development


                         Under the FVC grant, the City of Palo Alto has a total development budget of $104,000
                         for feature development of the RideAmigos Unity platform, suited to the pilot project
                         goals. Additionally, RideAmigos will be providing an additional 20% engineering &
                         development hours in-kind to the FVC pilot. This contract is a software development
                         agreement for that scope of work. The FVC custom feature development will include:
                              •   Payroll integration: Payroll export focused on   meeti~g   the needs of Bay Area
                                  pilots
                              •   Parking Cashout/Feebate*: creation of the software feature to support the
                                  administration of the incentive program
                              •   Commuter Wallet integration: a documented bi-directional data exchange
                                  mechanism (e.g., API) for interacting with the separate Commuter Wallet
                                  application, that is focused on exchanging trip tracking and fees/incentives data.
                              •   Customized reporting to support the evaluation of the pilot program
                         *The feebate pilot program aims to gain insights about the concept efficacy in a variety
                         of organizations. Feebate allows for employers to operate a revenue-neutral incentive
                         program to discourage the use of parking facilities and encourage the use of
                         "alternative" modes of transportation with many potential benefits. The core ECTR
                         RideAmigos platform paired with the FVC custom development will enable the ability to

                         support, and licensing are already included in those contracts. Within the framework of
                         those existing contracts, up to five pilot projects will be launched to test the

                                      them to be turned on.

                                                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
             This Exhibit shall be made a part of the City of Palo Alto's Professfonal Services Agreement or any other contract entered
             into by and between the City of Palo Alto (the "City") and Right Click Solutions, Inc.    (the "Consultant"')
             for the provision of Software as a Service to the City (the "Agreement").

        II



             In order to assure the privacy and security of the personal information of the City's customers and
             people who do business with the City, including, without limitation, vendors, utility customers, library
             patrons and other individuals and businesses, who are required to share such information with the
             City, as a condition of receiving services from the City or selling goods and services to the City,
             including, without limitation, the Software as a Service services provider (the "Consultant") and its
             subcontractors, if any, including, without limitation, any Information Technology ("IT") infrastructure
             services provider, shall design, install, provide, and maintain a secure IT environment, described
             below, while it renders and performs the Services and furnishes goods, if any, described in the
             Statement of Work, Exhibit B, to the extent any scope of work implicates the confidentiality and
             privacy of the personal information of the City's customers. The Consultant shall fulfill the data and
             information security requirements (the "Requirements") set forth in Part A below.

             A "secure IT environment" includes: (a) the IT infrastructure, by which the Services are provided to
             the City, including connection to the City's IT systems; (b) the Consultant's operations and
             maintenance processes needed to support the environment, including disaster recovery and business
             continuity planning; and (c) the IT infrastructure performance monitoring services to ensure a secure
             and reliable environment and service availability to the City. "IT infrastructure" refers to the
             integrated framework, including, without limitation, data centers, computers, and database
             management devices, upon which digital networks operate.

             In the event that, after the Effective Date, the Consultant reasonably determines that it cannot fulfill
             the Requirements, the Consultant shall promptly inform the City of its determination and submit, in
             writing, one or more alternate countermeasure options to the Requirements (the "Alternate
             Requirements" as set forth in Part B), which may be accepted or rejected in the reasonable
             satisfaction of the Information Security Manager (the "ISM").

             Part A.           Requirements:

             The Consultant shall at all times during the term of any contract between the City and the Consultant:

                  (a) Appoint or designate an employee, preferably an executive officer, as the security liaison to
                                                                                                                             Page 1of3

                 the City with respect to the Services to be performed under this Agreement.
             (b) Provide a full and complete response to the City's Supplier Security and Privacy Assessment
                 Questionnaire (the "Questionnaire") to the ISM, and also report any major non-conformance
                 to the Requirements, as and when requested. The response shall include a detailed
                 implementation plan of required countermeasures, which the City requires the Consultant to
                 adopt as countermeasures in the performance of the Services. In addition, as of the annual
                 anniversary date of this Agreement the Consultant shall report to the City, in writing, any
                 major changes to the IT infrastructure.
             (c) Have adopted and implemented information security and privacy policies that are
                 documented, are accessible to the City and conform to ISO 27001/2 - Information Security
                 Management Systems (ISMS) Standards. See the following:
                 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue tc/catalogue detail.htm?csnumber=42103
                 http://www.iso.org/iso/iso catalogue/catalogue tc/catalogue detail.htm?csnumber=50297
             (d) Conduct routine data and information security compliance training of its personnel that is
                 appropriate to their role.
             (e) Develop and maintain detailed documentation of the IT infrastructure, including software
                 versions and patch levels.
             (f) Develop an independently verifiable process, consistent with industry standards, for
                 performing professional and criminal background checks of its employees that (1) would
                 permit verification of employees' personal identity and employment status, and (2) would
                 enable the immediate denial of access to the City's confidential data and information by any
                 of its employees who no longer would require access to that information or who are
                 terminated.
             (g) Provide a list of IT infrastructure components in order to verify whether the Consultant has
                 met or has failed to meet any objective terms and conditions.
             (h) Implement access accountability (identification and authentication) architecture and support
                 role-base access control ("RBAC") and segregation of duties ("SoD") mechanisms for all
                 personnel, systems and software used to provide the Services. "RBAC" refers to a computer
                 systems security approach to restricting access only to authorized users. "SoD" is an approach
                 that would require more than one individual to complete a security task in order to promote
                 the detection and prevention of fraud and errors.
             (i) Assist the City in undertaking annually an assessment to assure that: (1) all elements of the
                 Services' environment design and deployment are known to the City, and (2) it has
                 implemented measures in accordance with industry best practices applicable to secure coding
                 and secure IT architecture.
             (j) Provide and maintain secure intersystem communication paths that would ensure the
                 confidentiality, integrity and availability of the City's information.
             (k) Deploy and maintain IT system upgrades, patches and configurations conforming to current
                 patch and/or release levels by not later than one (1) week after its date of release. Emergency
                 security patches must be installed within 24 hours after its date of release.
             (I) Provide for the timely detection of, response to, and the reporting of security incidents,
                 including on-going incident monitoring with logging.
             (m) Notify the City within one (1) hour of detecting a security incident that results in the
                 unauthorized access to or the misuse of the City's confidential data and information.
                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3

                  Consultant's and its third party service provider(s)' awareness of security policies and
                  practices, systems configurations, access authentication and authorization, and incident
                  detection and response.
              (q) Cooperate with the City to ensure that to the extent required by applicable laws, rules and

                 1. Objective
                  The City of Palo Alto (the "City") strives to promote and sustain a superior quality of life for persons in
                  Palo Alto. In promoting the quality of life of these persons, it is the policy of the City, consistent with the
                  provisions of the California Public Records Act, California Government Code§§ 6250 - 6270, to take
                  appropriate measures to safeguard the security and privacy of the personal (including, without limitation,
                  financial) information of persons, collected in the ordinary course and scope of conducting the City's
                  business as a local government agency. These measures are generally observed by federal, state and
                  local authorities and reflected in federal and California laws, the City's rules and regulations, and
                  industry best practices, including, without limitation, the provisions of California Civil Code§§ 1798.3(a),
                  1798.24, 1798.79.8(b), 1798.80(e), 1798.81.5, 1798.82(e), 1798.83(e)(7), and 1798.92(c). Though
                  some of these provisions do not apply to local government agencies like the City, the City will conduct
                  business in a manner which promotes the privacy of personal information, as reflected in federal and
                  California laws. The objective of this Policy is to describe the City's data security goals and objectives,
                  to ensure the ongoing protection of the Personal Information, Personally Identifiable Information,
                  Protected Critical Infrastructure lnformationand Personally Identifying Information of persons doing
                  business with the City and receiving services from the City or a third party under contract to the City to
                  provide services. The terms "Personal Information," "Protected Critical Infrastructure Information",
                  "Personally Identifiable Information" and "Personally Identifying lnformation"(collectively, the
                  "Information") are defined in the California Civil Code sections, referred to above, and are incorporated
                  in this Policy by reference.

                  A) INTENT
                  The City, acting in its governmental and proprietary capacities, collects the Information pertaining to
                  persons who do business with or receive services from the City. The Information is collected by a variety
                  of means, including, without limitation, from persons applying to receive services provided by the City,
                  persons accessing the City's website, and persons who access other information portals maintained by
                  the City's staff and/or authorized third-party contractors. The City is committed to protecting the privacy
                  and security of the Information collected by the City. The City acknowledges federal and California laws,
                  policies, rules, regulations and procedures, and industry best practices are dedicated to ensuring the
                  Information is collected, stored and utilized in compliance with applicable laws.
                  The goals and objectives of the Policy are: (a) a safe, productive, and inoffensive work environment for
                  all users having access to the City's applications and databases; (b) the appropriate maintenance and
                  security of database information assets owned by, or entrusted to, the City; (c) the controlled access
                  and security of the Information provided to the City's staff and third party contractors; and (d) faithful
                  compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

                  B)   SCOPE

                  The Policy will guide the City's staff and, indirectly, third party contractors, which are by contract
                  required to protect the confidentiality and privacy of the Information of the persons whose personal
                  information data are intended to be covered by the Policy and which will be advised by City staff to
                  conform their performances to the Policy should they enjoy conditional access to that information.

                  C) CONSEQUENCES

                  The City's employees shall comply with the Policy in the execution of their official duties to the extent
                  their work implicates access to the Information referred to in this Policy. A failure to comply may result in

       processes and technologies within the scope of responsibility of each user.

        0) RESPONSIBILITY OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY {IT) MANAGERS
       The City's IT Managers, who are responsible for internal, external, direct and indirect connections to the
       City's networks, will be responsible for configuring, maintaining and securing the City's IT networks in
       compliance with the City's information security and privacy policies. They are also responsible for timely
       internal reporting of events that may have compromised network, system or data security.

        E) RESPONSIBILITY OF AUTHORIZATION COORDINATION

       the Software as a Service (SaaS) Security and Privacy Terms and Conditions. An NOA must be
       executed prior to the sharing of the Information of persons covered by this Policy with third party
       contractors. The City's approach to managing information security and its implementation (i.e.
       objectives, policies, processes, and procedures for information security) will be reviewed independently
       by the ISM at planned intervals, or whenever significant changes to security implementation have
       occurred.
        The CIO, acting by the ISM, will review and recommend changes to the Policy annually, or as
        appropriate, commencing from the date of its adoption.




3.      PRIVACY POLICY
        A)   OVERVIEW

        The Policy applies to activities that involve the use of the City's information assets, namely, the
        Information of persons doing business with the City or receiving services from the City, which are owned
        by, or entrusted to, the City and will be made available to the City's employees and third party
        contractors under contract to the City to provide Software as a Service consulting services. These
        activities include, without limitation, accessing the Internet, using e-mail, accessing the City's intranet or
        other networks, systems, or devices.
        The term "information assets" also includes the personal information of the City's employees and any
        other related organizations while those assets are under the City's control. Security measures will be
        designed, implemented, and maintained to ensure that only authorized persons will enjoy access to the
        information assets. The City's staff will act to protect its information assets from theft, damage, loss,
        compromise, and inappropriate disclosure or alteration. The City will plan, design, implement and
        maintain information management systems, networks and processes in order to assure the appropriate
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information assets to the City's employees and authorized
        third parties.

        B) PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CHOICE
        Except as permitted or provided by applicable laws, the City will not share the Information of any person
        doing business with the City, or receiving services from the City, in violation of this Policy, unless that

        as a local government agency with third parties under contract to the City to provide services.

                                                                                        Information Security Services


        C)   METHODS OF COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

        The City may gather the Information from a variety of sources and resources, provided that the
        collection of such information is both necessary and appropriate in order for the City to conduct
        business as a local government agency in its governmental and proprietary capacities. That information
        may be gathered at service windows and contact centers as well as at web sites, by mobile applications,
        and with other technologies, wherever the City may interact with persons who need to share such
        formation in order to secure the City's services.
        The City's staff will inform the persons whose Information are covered by this Policy that the City's web
        site may use "cookies" to customize the browsing experience with the City of Palo Alto web site. The
        City will note that a cookie contains unique information that a web site can use to track, among others,
        the Internet Protocol address of the computer used to access the City's web sites, the identification of
        the browser software and operating systems used, the date and time a user accessed the site, and the
        Internet address of the website from which the user linked to the City's web sites. Cookies created on
        the user's computer by using the City's web site do not contain the Information, and thus do not
        compromise the user's privacy or security. Users can refuse the cookies or delete the cookie files from
        their computers by using any of the widely available methods. If the user chooses not to accept a cookie
        on his or her computer, it will not prevent or prohibit the user from gaining access to or using the City's
        sites.

        0) UTILITIES SERVICE
        In the provision of utility services to persons located within Palo Alto, the City of Palo Alto Utilities
        Department ("CPAU") will collect the Information in order to initiate and manage utility services to
        customers. To the extent the management of that information is not specifically addressed in the
        Utilities Rules and Regulations or other ordinances, rules, regulations or procedures, this Policy will
        apply; provided, however, any such Rules and Regulations must conform to this Policy, unless
        otherwise directed or approved by the Council. This includes the sharing of CPAU-collected Information
        with other City departments except as may be required by law.
        Businesses and residents with standard utility meters and/or having non-metered monthly services will
        have secure access through a CPAU website to their Information, including, without limitation, their
        monthly utility usage and billing data. In addition to their regular monthly utilities billing, businesses and
        residents with non-standard or experimental electric, water or natural gas meters may have their usage
        and/or billing data provided to them through non-City electronic portals at different intervals than with
        the standard monthly billing.
        Businesses and residents with such non-standard or experimental metering will have their Information
        covered by the same privacy protections and personal information exchange rules applicable to
        Information under applicable federal and California laws.

        E) PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
        The Information that is collected by the City in the ordinary course and scope of conducting its business
        could be incorporated in a public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public,
        unless such information is exempt from disclosure to the public by California law.

        F)   ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION

        The City will take reasonable steps to verify a person's identity before the City will grant anyone online
        access to that person's Information. Each City department that collects Information will afford access to
        affected persons who can review and update that information at reasonable times.

       G) SECURITY, CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE
       Except as otherwise provided by applicable law or this Policy, the City will treat the Information of
       persons covered by this Policy as confidential and will not disclose it, or permit it to be disclosed, to third
       parties without the express written consent of the person affected. The City will develop and maintain
       reasonable controls that are designed to protect the confidentiality and security of the Information of
       persons covered by this Policy.
       The City may authorize the City's employee and or third party contractors to access and/or use the
       Information of persons who do business with the City or receive services from the City. In those
       instances, the City will require the City's employee and/or the third party contractors to agree to use
       such Information only in furtherance of City-related business and in accordance with the Policy.
       If the City becomes aware of a breach, or has reasonable grounds to believe that a security breach has
       occurred, with respect to the Information of a person, the City will notify the affected person of such
       breach in accordance with applicable laws. The notice of breach will include the date(s) or estimated
       date(s) of the known or suspected breach, the nature of the Information that is the subject of the breach,
       and the proposed action to be taken or the responsive action taken by the City.

       H) DATA RETENTION/ INFORMATION RETENTION
       The City will store and secure all Information for a period of time as may be required by law, or if no
       period is established by law, for seven (7) years, and thereafter such information will be scheduled for
       destruction.

        I)   SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS) OVERSIGHT

       The City may engage third party contractors and vendors to provide software application and database
       services, commonly known as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
       In order to assure the privacy and security of the Information of those who do business with the City and
       those who received services from the City, as a condition of selling goods and/or services to the City,
       the Saas services provider and its subcontractors, if any, including any IT infrastructure services
       provider, shall design, install, provide, and maintain a secure IT environment, while it performs such
       services and/or furnishes goods to the City, to the extent any scope of work or services implicates the
       confidentiality and privacy of the Information.

       These requirements include information security directives pertaining to: (a) the IT infrastructure, by
       which the services are provided to the City, including connection to the City's IT systems; (b) the Saas
       services provider's operations and maintenance processes needed to support the IT environment,
       including disaster recovery and business continuity planning; and (c) the IT infrastructure performance
       monitoring services to ensure a secure and reliable environment and service availability to the City. The
       term "IT infrastructure" refers to the integrated framework, including, without limitation, data centers,
       computers, and database management devices, upon which digital networks operate.

        Prior to entering into an agreement to provide services to the City, the City's staff will require the Saas
        services provider to complete and submit an Information Security and Privacy Questionnaire. In the
        event that the Saas services provider reasonably determines that it cannot fulfill the information security
        requirements during the course of providing services, the City will require the Saas services provider to
        promptly inform the ISM.

        J) FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTION ACT OF 2003
        CPAU will require utility customers to provide their Information in order for the City to initiate and
        manage utility services to them.

                         ALO ALTO                                                                            City of Palo Alto
                                                                                                      Information Technology

                  Federal regulations, implementing the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (Public Law
                  108-159), including the Red Flag Rules, require that CPAU, as a "covered financial institution or
                  creditor" which provides services in advance of payment and which can affect consumer credit, develop
                  and implement procedures for an identity theft program for new and existing accounts to detect,
                  prevent, respond and mitigate potential identity theft of its customers' Information.
                 CPAU procedures for potential identity theft will be reviewed independently by the ISM annually or
                 whenever significant changes to security implementation have occurred. The ISM will recommend
                 changes to CPAU identity theft procedures, or as appropriate, so as to conform to this Policy.
                 There are California laws which are applicable to identity theft; they are set forth in California Civil Code
                 § 1798.92.

 Dear Mayor and Council Members:

 On behalf of City Manager Jim Keene, please find below in bold staff responses to
 inquiries made by Council Member Tanaka in regard to the December 10, 2018 council
 meeting agenda.

 Item 7: Adoption of MOA for UMPAPA – CM Tanaka


 Item 7: Adoption of MOA for UMPAPA

           Q. 1. 12% is a very large amount for a salary increase for 48 employees. How was
           this amount decided on? Is this really the best the city could negotiate?

           A. 1. As described in the staff report, this is the first general wage increase for
           these employees since 2013. This compensation adjustment reflects a
           negotiated agreement, balancing workforce attraction and retention issues as
           developed in consultation with the City Council.



Thank you,
Judy Ng

Dear City Council Members,

I understand that at tomorrow’s City Council meeting, there is a proposal to increase base pay by 12% for all supervisors
and managers of the utility department. This seems excessive and unwarranted. If there are specific critical individuals
who are deemed a flight risk, then perhaps some targeted approach to retain those individuals could be considered. But
an across‐the‐board increase of this magnitude does NOT seem responsible.

Please be fiscal stewards of our city’s finances and remove this from consent calendar.

Respectfully,

Dear City Council,

Thank you very much for doing the right thing with Mr. Keene's compensation. I know that sometimes the right answer
is hard politically; however, you will sleep better at night if you continue to follow the same rules.

It has come to my attention that the city staff has reached a Memorandum of Agreement with UMPAPA (Utilities
Management and Professional Association of Palo Alto). Again, I am shocked that the agreement contains a 12% base
salary increase for all members of UMPAPA (with a total cost to the city: $1.14 million). I know that the standard percent
increase the City gives to its employees every year is 3.1%.

Also, so you know, I work in the health care field and have not had a raise in the last ten years (in fact, I have had my pay
cut each year by approximately 1‐1.5%).

Please reconsider this agreement. Spending money that we don't have doesn't make any sense.

Thank you very much for listening to your constituents

Graham Dresden

The UMPAPA issue is a hold up and we are forking over our money. This is 1 million dollars we are forking over for no
reason, except that they asked for it. Unless they have got something to show for that, besides a ransom demand, we
should stand our ground. Vote for rationality and vote against UMPAPA.

Dear city council members,

As a Palo Alto resident, I am alarmed that the city staff reached a Memorandum of Agreement with UMPAPA for a 12%
base salary increase for all members of UMPAPA.

This 12% salary increase is 4x the typical pay increase for city workers.

Before this is fully passed, I believe the council should publicly explain the reasons for such a high increase in pay.

I just read this. Is it accurate?
Why would we not just do COLA as others do?
I think we need our City Council members to be fiscally responsible and help balance our budget, not overkill on raises.

At tomorrow’s City Council meeting, there is a proposal to increase base pay by 12% for all 48 supervisors and managers
of the utility department. This seems excessive given the fiscal challenges our city faces. I would think that if there are
specific critical individuals who are deemed a flight risk, then perhaps some targeted approach to retain those individuals

what the first line employees would think if this were approved.

City Council,

The 48 managerial positions up for a 12% pay raise can live with an increase more in line with other
city employees.



3% is still a very nice raise. More than I've received the last two years.



Just say no to such an exorbitant pay raise.

Thank you, City of Palo Alto, for considering this new draft policy of offering 6 weeks of paid time off for birthing
parents, adoptions, foster children and non-birthing parents. As a Registered Nurse and mother of young
children, I whole-heartedly believe that this is a step in the right direction for healthy babies and healthy
families. Although I am proud of the City’s willingness to start with this proposal, I hope that you will soon
consider extending paid time off from 6 to 12 weeks, which is the current recommendation by health care
professionals. This is also in-line with many of the other employers in our city, a city that is known around the
world as a progressive and innovative place to live and work. In order to recruit and retain a dedicated and
highly competitive workforce, the City’s future depends on a policy that is at minimum with state law and is in
line with other cities. I thank the City for putting a proposed policy forward and look forward to a decision that
supports the health and wellness of our future generation!

Subject:                In Support of Paid Parental Leave


Dear Council Members,

I'm pleased to know the Council is considering a measure to provide paid parental leave to City employees. I hope this is
adopted at a minimum, and strongly encourage you to consider the extending the PTO to 12 weeks. Twelve weeks is the
current standard recommendation by health care professionals to heal and bond.

Although some daycare's allow babies at 6 weeks, it’s dangerous to expose an unvaccinated newborn to that
environment. In CA, the vaccination schedule starts at the 2 month (9 week) appointment.

In addition to the bonding and health concerns for an infant, I'd like to share some personal details to explain why I think
12 weeks is reasonable. This may seem overly personal or graphic, but giving birth is a physical event to recover from
that is frequently glossed over. Five weeks after after a routine vaginal delivery with normal vaginal tearing I had only
just become comfortable standing and sitting. I cannot imagine returning to work after six weeks. Can you imagine
having to perform your job duties while your genitals are still tender from giving birth and your perineal stitches haven't
fully dissolved? What about performing your job after having major abdominal surgery?

Let's consider non‐birthing parents too and talk about sleep and self care.

My baby wasn't sleeping more than 90 to 120 minutes at a time until 6 weeks. This meant that I wasn't sleeping for
more than 45 minutes at a time unless my spouse or a visiting family member was able to take care of the baby for a
stretch of time. It takes time to recover from short term sleep deprivation.

A study by the NIH found that new fathers on leave got less sleep than new mothers, until they returned to work and
then the mother bore the burden of sleep deprivation. Another NIH study found that "In otherwise healthy adults, short‐
term consequences of sleep disruption include increased stress responsivity, somatic pain, reduced quality of life,
emotional distress and mood disorders, and cognitive, memory, and performance deficits." (source)

New parents (adoptive, foster, birthing or non birthing) need time to take care of themselves emotionally, physically,
and mentally after bringing a new child home. The fact is, they will be able to do their jobs better after 12 weeks than
after 6 weeks because they will be getting more sleep. Please, do right by them and their co‐workers by extending this
paid leave policy.

A paid parental leave policy is a great step to make the City a more inclusive employer. The City’s future depends on a
policy that is at minimum with state law and is in line with other cities to stay competitive for talent. Again, I thank the
City for putting a proposed policy forward and am glad this progress has been made.

Giselle Rahn

Subject:            12/10 Council Agenda Questions for Item 14




 Dear Mayor and Council Members:

 On behalf of City Manager Jim Keene, please find below in bold staff responses to
 inquiries made by Council Member Tanaka in regard to the December 10, 2018 council
 meeting agenda.

 Action Item 14: Approval of 5‐Year Aquatics Operating/Revenue Agreement with Team
 Sheeper – CM Tanaka


 Item 14: Approval of 5‐Year Aquatics Operating/Revenue Agreement with Team
 Sheeper – CM Tanaka

 Q.1. Why is the City Council being asked to approve a new five‐year contract at this time
 based on 2017 user survey data? Shouldn't the city council wait until we have the 2018
 user survey data to evaluate this contract? Does the survey data (2017 and 2018) include
 results from each of the major pool user constituencies? If not, why not?

 A.1. The user survey data included in the staff report is for calendar year 2018.The
 recommendation to City Council to approve a new contract is based on the results of
 the RFP process. The user survey data provides additional supporting data to help
 inform that decision.

 Survey data is collected from all pool users with the exception of PASA and Masters
 swimmers since those are managed by their respective head coaches through a
 subcontract agreement with Team Sheeper. Feedback is communicated directly
 between the coaches and Team Sheeper.

 Q.2. Could the vote on the Team Sheeper contract be postponed/removed from the
 November 26, 2018 City Council meeting? What would be the ramifications if the city
 council were to take more time to evaluate this proposed contract? Would an interim
 extension of the existing contracts be feasible?

 A.2. The agenda item was postponed until December 10, 2018 to allow for additional
 time for Sheeper and Rinconada Masters to discuss a future subcontract. The


                                                            1
preference is to start the new contract at the beginning of a new season so there aren’t
changes to the pool schedule and prices mid‐season.

Q.3. Has the Parks and Recreation Commission recommended that the City Council
approve the new Team Sheeper contract? If not, why? If yes, please provide the materials
used in reaching their recommendation. In either case, what was the Commission’s vote?

A.3. A presentation was made to the Parks and Recreation Commission by Community
Services Department staff on October 23, 2018. The Commission provided feedback
but did not take action as it is not typical for a Commission to take action on a
contract. The Parks and Recreation Commission did encourage the City to find a
solution to keep Rinconada Masters at the pool.

Q.4. If I understand the timing correctly, the city did not send the RFP out to the bidders
until July 18, 2018. The RFP process closed on August 21, 2018. Was this a reasonable
amount of time to give bidders that are not as familiar with the Rinconada operations
enough time to submit their proposals? Is it possible that some new potential vendors
did not submit proposals because they would have had only a few months to negotiate
their new contract plus initiate their new operations at the Rinconada Pool?

A.4. We believe this was a reasonable amount of time. The timeframe for issuing the
RFP and the length of time it was open were recommended by the ASD’s Purchasing
Team and match standards used across the City.

Q. 5. Given the financial numbers and projections provided when Team Sheeper's
current contract was approved by the City Council in 2017, why does the city manager
recommend that we approve a new contract with Team Sheeper now without a
reasonable review of those numbers and projections versus the actual numbers during
the past two years? Are those future projections still accurate and reliable?

A.5. Staff have reviewed financials throughout the term of the current
contract. Aquatics revenue and revenue shares came in lower than expected in
Calendar Year 2018 (based on data through October 31, 2018.) However, the lower
revenue is not significant – revenue shares will be approximately $10,000 as compared
with budgeted expectations of $30,000.

Team Sheeper submitted lower revenue expectations with this new RFP bid than what
they’d proposed in their 2015 bid. This was based on their actual experience over
current contract term. FY 20 revenue share projections are approximately $10,000 and
approximately $20,000 in FY 21 as Sheeper expects programs to slowly grow.

Q.6. During the 2017 process to approve Team Sheeper's current contract, the Aquatics
Department forecast 2019 revenue sharing paid to the City of $125,000. Is that still a
valid assumption for 2019? If not, what is the City’s current 2019 revenue forecast (based
on its revenue share with Team Sheeper) and how does that compare to the actual 2017
and 2018 revenue numbers?

A.6. Staff is still reviewing these numbers and will have them available at the Council
meeting tonight.

Q.7. What is Team Sheeper's forecast for overall revenue from operating and managing
Rinconada pool for 2019?

                                                            2
 A.7. The new contract estimates $823,000 of overall revenue for Calendar Year 2019.

 Q.8. During the approval process in 2017, the Aquatics Department forecast 2019 City
 operating pool costs of $60,000. Does this include both operating costs and non‐
 operating (capitalized pool maintenance and improvements) costs? Please provide the
 actual numbers for 2017 and 2018. What are the City’s current forecasted 2019 and 2020
 operating costs? How will the City cover any operating costs in excess of the $60,000
 forecasted amount? What are the similar numbers for non‐operating costs?

 A.8. Direct operating costs are approximately $60,000 per fiscal year between staffing,
 supplies and materials. We have another $300,000 annual cost for Public Works
 maintenance and utilities. We do not expect major capital investments in the near
 future. We also do not expect these City expenses to change during the contract
 term. Some of the operating costs are offset by the 1% revenue the City receives from
 Sheeper.

 Q.9. For the Masters swim program only, what are the actual 2017 and 2018 numbers
 for 1) gross fees collected by Team Sheeper and 2) the revenue sharing percent and
 amount paid or due to the City? How do these compare to amounts paid to the City by
 the masters team before the current Team Sheeper contract began? What does Team
 Sheeper forecast for revenue for the masters program for 2019 based on the 2019 pool
 schedule that Team Sheeper submitted?

 A.9. Before the Sheeper contract, the Masters program paid the City about $14,000 per
 year for use of the pool. Masters pays Team Sheeper approximately $20,000 per year
 under the current contract. The city received 1% of the Masters revenue in 2018.

 Q.10. Will the city receive its revenue share payments on a monthly basis or on another
 payment schedule?

 A.10. Yearly. Team Sheeper will provide monthly revenue estimates and yearly
 payments.




Thank you,

Dear Ms O'Kane,

In a last ditch effort, I am asking that you modify your request to the city council for approval of the Tim Sheeper
proposal. Instead, you could offer a one year extension of his current proposal, with some fee increases.

There are many more people than just the 65 Master's swimmers who do Not want this proposal to be approved. There
are many of us (three of us lap swimmers in just the four houses on my block) who do Not want to have Tim run the
Master's program. We have all swum at Burgess pool during his Master's program ‐ those young pups are serious
swimmers ‐‐ they can be noisy and rambunctious. We are Not wanting that environment at our Rinconada. Plus, we
love to see the long standing friendships and community that make up the Master's club. What a shame that the city is
seeking to break this up, simply because a gate was open (it has been open for Masters for years without a single kid
wandering in and drowning) and Tim doesn't think Carol has enough life guards. This smacks of an Excuse, not a reason
(there have been 2 incidents in 47 years ‐ two heart attacks and both swimmers survived).

I know this is making your life more difficult ‐‐ you didn't receive any other proposals. But you also admitted that you
Could have written your RFP to include Carol as the Master's coach. You Could have checked with us swimmers Before
the RFP was written to see what WE wanted, not just find out what Tim wanted.

I believe it is the city's responsibility to fix this problem. It was created by the city and it ought to be fixed by the city.

I for one am pretty upset that while I pay for Rinconada, both through fees and property taxes, I am losing a beloved
program ‐ simply because the city is (again!) catering towards a business need, not what the residents want.

Have you watched the city council meetings? Dozens of us, all giving up multiple Monday evenings, just to plead for
something the city is taking away from us ‐ when it doesn't have to!

You can fix this and I implore you to do just that.

Kristen,

It's Dec. 5, and lap swimmers have not received your e‐mailed fact sheet.

After reading through the report the Recreation Services Department will be presenting on Dec. 10 at the City Council
meeting, I have the following comments and concerns (as do many in the swimming community):

PRESENTATION:
The critical feedback Recreation Services Department has received from the swimming community in the past year has
been left out. It is not an honest report; if it were, members of the swimming community would not be attending City
Council meetings to express their unaddressed concerns.

CONTRACT:
1) The contract states that Team Sheeper will provide 400‐500 hours of lap lane hours/week. There is nothing in the
contract to protect the current (and exclusive) use of the pool for lap swimming during PRIME hours (6‐8:30am and 6‐
8:30pm). This has been a major concern of the lap swimming community.
2) There is nothing in the contract to protect the hours of operation of the pool on weekends and weekdays.
3) Rinconada Masters has been terminated with no equal replacement for the swimming community, and the City has
condoned this rather than supported the community team.
4) The contract does not require a review by the swimming community/City before Team Sheeper implements new
schedules.

JANUARY SAMPLE SCHEDULE:
1) Dedicated evening lap swimming has been seriously compromised. Only 3‐7 lanes are provided two weeknights per
week, and the pool closes earlier. PASA has been given a big advantage. Where is the community´s representation in
this?
2) What is the schedule for the other 11 months? What protects the swimming community from further upsets and
surprises?
3) How are the hours of operation going to fluctuate year round? Are we going to have decreased hours of operation,
especially during the summer (as happened last summer).

We are pushing for the Recreation Services Department to act in the swimming community's interest. Team Sheeper´s
Burgess pool feels less like a community pool and more like Team Sheeper´s private pool. I swim at Rinconada exactly
because it´s NOT Burgess ‐ it´s a COMMUNITY pool with COMMUNITY focused hours of operation and a schedule that
doesn’t mix users in the same time slots. Let´s protect our swimming community in the contract. This is what we were
promised from day one.


I have copied the City Council with this email so all are aware of the swimming community's ongoing and unresolved
concerns with the proposed contract.

Dear lap swimmers,

As a user of Rinconada Pool, I wanted to ensure you knew that the proposed Aquatics Contract has been moved to the
December 10, 2018 City Council Meeting. The agenda for the December 10th meeting will be posted this Thursday. The
item was moved because of concern that tonight’s full agenda would not provide ample time for community comments
and City Council discussion on this important topic.

In the meantime, staff will be preparing a fact sheet to clarify common questions we have heard, and we will send that
out in the next few days. We will also post it at the pool. If you would like to meet with me or another staff member
before December 10th, please let me know and I will be happy to find a time to meet with you.

Regarding the Pool Contract

Staff Report

According to staff report ID#9841, “the City struggled to hire and retain adequate pool staff …”
It appears that the proposed contractor can hire and retain staff. Why is it easier for the contractor? The local
hiring pool is the same. (Where my wife used to work, they had staffing shortages. The library did not allow
willing people to work more than half time because then they had to provide costly benefits. And people would
only stay around until they could find work with more hours and benefits.)

The staff report appears to be cut and pasted from Team Sheeper advertising material.

The part about continuous contract safety violations seems strange. It would be interesting to know what they
are. Swimmers seem to feel safe.

The report anticipates General Fund savings of approximately $140,000. How is Team Sheeper able to
provide this savings? Do they pay their lifeguards less? Do they charge users more? What kind of a business
is Team Sheeper? They need to buy insurance. What taxes do they pay?

Contract

Exhibit A
Item I.a.ii requires two lifeguards on deck. This seems to be a new requirement, at least for lap swimming. For
lap swimming, there have historically been two on duty, taking turns with one on deck and one managing
admissions. This has been very satisfactory and it seems unnecessary to have two on deck. Lap swimming is
very orderly and the swimmers competent, not like summer recreational swim where all is chaos. Having a
third person on duty will increase costs and put upward pressure on user pricing.

Item I.c.iii prohibits lifeguard use of cell phones while on deck. Some lifeguards like to listen to music and
podcasts on their phones. Is this now prohibited? Probably necessary for recreational swim but not lap swim.

Item II.c.ii specifies at least 400 lap swim lane hours/week. This is less than half the number shown on the
proposed schedule. If all the required hours were scheduled in the middle of the day, that would not work for
me.

Subject:             Re: Tim Sheeper + Masters




Dear Ms O'Kane and the City Council,

Thank you for encouraging Tim Sheeper to work with Carol McPherson of the Rinc Masters swim program. They met
today and he offered her a contract for 6 months, with restrictions, fee increases, and changes.

One restriction is that Tim will not allow her to teach the Swim4Fitness class. This class is the only class that teaches
adults how to improve their strokes and is taught by an experienced coach (not a high school student during summer
months). It's a small class, with revolving students, typically 6‐8 at any given time. As I've mentioned to the city council,
my son with mental health issues is finally learning to swim, at age 17, and after many attempts to teach him (including
an attempt through Tim Sheeper this summer).

Thus, I am personally very sad and sorry to see this ended. It has meant a lot to me and my son, and it feels like a loss
that I cannot understand. Why oh why would he exclude this wonderful program????

Equally puzzling is why he is offering just 6 months, unless it is to appease the swimmers, with hopes of his quietly
refusing to renew in June.

While we are pleased there has been some movement on Tim's part, it doesn't feel quite right. It would be better if he
allowed her to teach Swim4Fitness and the contract was for the year, with the same fees she pays today.

BTW, there is talk of moving her entire program to another pool (which is happy to accept her). If this happens, Tim will
likely lose revenue from nearly 60 swimmers (or more, if lap swimmers like me move too, which I will). And probably
more importantly, create a sense of ill will. I have loved swimming at Rinconada for decades, sure hate to lose it
because Tim doesn't like working with Carol.

Sincerely,
Ann Protter

Subject:              Rinconada Pool vision


As an avid lap‐swimmer, I am dismayed that swim program management discussions remain unclear and contentious.
My sense is that there are two core difficulties: a lack of a clear shared vision for the pool community, and a lack of a
clear process for stakeholder oversight and input in the realization of such a vision.

I am forwarding a sketch of a vision that I had sent to the city in March, apparently to no effect. Perhaps with city council
involvement, we can exercise more control and develop a better model for ensuring community integration in oversight
of community facility management.

Given the late stages of contract negotiations, would it be possible to extend the current contract for some period, and
undertake a more transparent and inclusive planning process under the oversight of city council?

Thank you for your time and efforts on behalf of the community,
‐‐ Susanne

Dear Stephanie,

I was at the meeting last night. I'm sorry it's such an uphill battle to do the right thing and solicit community input.

I think the heart of the difficulty is that we don't have a shared vision for the pool. It's like the car salesman I once
encountered: I walked onto the lot certain that I wanted to buy a particular car model, but wanted to check out driving
visibility, and how hard it would be to load my bike. The salesman kept asking, "Have you decided what color you want?"
I walked out, and went straight to another dealer.

I've sketched out a long‐term vision below. I think that you'll find life much easier if you have something like this to work
from. It turns the conversation to goals, priorities and evaluation criteria rather than opening the Pandora's box of
personal opinion.

I'd be happy to talk with you about it. I have limited time, but would be happy to do what I can to help flesh it out.

Thank you for all the work you do,
‐‐ Susanne

Council members:

As a concerned citizen of Palo Alto, and a supporter of Palo Altans for Sensible Zoning, I have been following the story of
AJ Partners'
aquisition of the President Hotel apartments and their attempt to bulldoze the city into allowing them to evict the
extant tenants and return the building to functioning as a hotel.

The entire process stinks and looks as if AJ has been acting underhandedly to get the city to quickly eliminate a number
or laws and ordinances which would (1) protect scarce rental housing in Palo Alto, (2) override legal protection for the
use of grandfathered buildings, such as the President, from having their uses changed (such as, from rental apartments
to a boutique hotel), and (3) override the zoning requirements for commercial buildings to provide adequate parking,
among other things.

All this without proper and open and public discussion with a lame duck City Council.

I agree with PASZ that
1) No change be made to the law without a full vetting and review by the Planning and Transportation Commission, as is
normally required, and

2) That any revision should continue to prevent residential uses from changing to commercial ones so as to preserve
Downtown housing and protect tenants from being displaced.

Backroom deals have no place in our city. To me, this whole process smells of corruption and slime and I am
disappointed in all of you who are pushing this destructive process forward.

Subject:          Hotel Conversion



Dear Council Members,
I am writing to oppose the changes proposed by staff to Section 18.18.120 (Grandfathered Uses and
Facilities) of Chapter 18.18 (Downtown Commercial District) of Title 18 (Zoning) of the Palo Alto
Municipal Code (PAMC) to Adjust Regulations Relating to Noncomplying Facilities.

 Why is the council letting “secret” demands by AJ Capital pressure the council to do its bidding?
1.The council should follow proper procedure and have the PTC vet the proposed ordinance.
2. The 2019 Council should discuss the proposed ordinance.
3. If the regulations need changing, allow commercial-to-retail use conversions for noncomplying
facilities. With the ongoing housing crisis, under no circumstances should we convert housing to other
uses.

As the Palo Alto Weekly states in this week’s editorial, this Council item is “a perfect demonstration of
what is wrong with Palo Alto city government these days.” The council

I hope the incoming City Council is more transparent in its dealings and treats the people who want to
comment at council meetings, with proper respect.

Subject:             President Hotel parking requirements


Dear Mayor Kniss and Council Members,

It is unfortunate that affordable housing at the old President Hotel has been lost. I am not in a position to judge
whether a hotel was an approved use at the time that the property was sold.

I do know that any reduction in the number of parking spaces required by its use as a new hotel should never be
approved. The ten underground spaces are clearly inadequate. There is inadequate parking, now, in downtown Palo
Alto. As a long‐time resident, my trips downtown are greatly reduced now as a result of inadequate parking.

The comments by A J Capital that parking is not required because present day travelers are using ride sharing is far from
being proven.
Ride sharing vehicles still occupy our streets and require extended time to connect with riders and load luggage. If the
hotel suggests it will use valet parking, then they need to be required to prove that they have secured that parking
facility or they need to pay to have it established. Please do not reduce the presently required number of parking
spaces, based on occupancy, are prescribed by current code.

People do drive their own cars to conduct business and visit family in Palo Alto. It will be a long time before transit or
ride sharing will allow parking requirements to be drastically reduced in this case or in any other similar applications.

Sincerely,

        Roy Stehle

Hello,
When we have the housing crisis we have here in Palo Alto, I think it’s a bad idea to change laws so that a developer can
swoop in and create another hotel. We need affordable housing more than we need another hotel, and I think the city
council should act accordingly.
Thank you.

Subject:          Agenda Item 16, Non-Complying Faciities Downtown



Dear Mayor Kniss and Council Members;
When I first read this staff report it didn't seem very controversial, but recently messages on the
Internet note that the way it is written it would allow conversion of the President Hotel from housing to
other uses such as a hotel, while current law requires retention of housing there since that was the
use when the building became non-conforming. Presumably when the ordinance was passed in 2016
it was intended allow residential uses downtown to be non-compliant, that non-conforming uses must
retain the same use when remodeling. However the ordinance apparently allows converting the
residential use at the President Hotel to a hotel because the new use would be conforming. That is a
very unfortunate result of the current version of the ordinance change. Therefore I suggest that the
ordinance be revised to require retention of non-conforming apartment uses.

Palo Alto has a major jobs-housing imbalance, and a huge lack of affordable housing. The 75
relatively low-income housing at the President Hotel are more affordable units than have been built in
Palo Alto in the past two years. It is very bad policy to vote to remove housing units, and even worse
policy to lose so many lower income units.

Please do not adopt the current version of the ordinance but either amend it to exclude residential
units in non-conforming buildings from being replaced, or send the entire ordinance to Planning and
Transportation for more detailed review.

Regards, Bob Moss

Dear City Council,
Do you remember that funny meeting where everyone — the state, the YIMBY contingents, the council, the Comp Plan
team, city staff, and the public— was pressing Palo Alto to rezone in order to eliminate apartments and build more hotel
rooms? Me neither.

Staff is wrong to bring this effort forward and try to amend zoning on behalf of a developer whose interests are NOT
ALIGNED with the city’s need for more housing. Pretty much everybody agrees we need housing. Where does the Comp
Plan say that hotel rooms are a higher priority than housing?

Dear City Council members:

I urge you to take the ethical and appropriate path in your response to A.J. Capital's request to bend the rules
in its favor ‐ and perhaps in the interests of certain council members. Like many residents, I spend my day
growing tech companies so that I can afford the ever increasing cost of living that is directly related to your
inability to make competent decisions on planning for the future. There will be a point where people like me ‐
and there are many ‐ decide to spend more time ensuring that your actions are transparent and accountable.

Do the right thing. Help Palo Alto properly address its inadequate housing ‐ for all demographics ‐ and plan
properly for the future by representing everyone's interests. Say no to A.J. Capital.

Best,

City Council Members:

Regarding the December 10 meeting, please do NOT overturn the ordinance that prohibits downtown property owners
from changing the use of oversized buildings.

Prior to any modifications to this law:


       Staff should conduct a policy analysis to evaluate the broad ramifications of elimination.
       PTC should review the ordinance per the standard procedure.
       Modifications should be considered that would reflect city goals, for example, allow changes in use that would
        convert commercial or offices to housing or retail, but prevent changes in use that would convert housing or retail
        to commercial or offices.


There is no need to rush a decision. The consequences of this law extend far beyond any short-term issues surrounding
use of the President.

Thank you.

           Dear Council members -

           Like many other residents I have no
           comprehension of why you would correct an error
           or staff change that somehow got into the code -
           knowing full well that this will help developers
           to further add to the housing/parking shortage
           and their bottom line. Correct the error - but not
           speedily rush it through as it will deliberately sell
           out the best interest of Palo Alto. Use wording
           which will correct the problem, but not sell out our
           city.

           Everyone of you holding the title of City Council
           Member ran a campaign to prove to each and
           every voter - YOU - would make a promise to do
           what is best for the Residents of Palo Alto, the
           Town of Palo Alto and the Quality of Life in Palo
           Alto Your vote on this issue puts that promise
           seriously in jeopardy. It is hard to understand
           that the majority sentiment on the Council wants
           to sell us out so developers can mow us over and
           get richer.

           Unfortunately my Monday nite class ends too late
           to get to City Hall and sign in to speak to the
                                                   3

Jeff Levinsky, as he has more details and
specifics than I do - and think you should hear all
he has to say regarding the rules and regulations
for this issue. Hopefully, you will honor my
request. Thank you .


BTW I wonder why no one ever caught a
typo or staff change with such important
ramifications, for years. We “supposedly” pay to
hire the best. Simple typos are one thing, but
that fact that no one reviewed the document in
detail makes me suspect of how this might show
up in the future with other documents. This is
not the first error (not just typing) that has cost us
tax dollars that we pay to hire the best.


Thank you for permitting my request

Dear Council Members,
I would like to strongly request that you do not change zoning so as to allow apartments to be able to convert to hotels
or any other use but residential. We need housing in Palo Alto, especially below market rate housing. I fail to understand
how you can assert that we need to address the jobs/housing imbalance and at the same time take actions to reduce
much needed housing. This makes no sense and it continues to boggle my mind. I fervently hope that you do the right
thing and desist from changing zoning to allow the apartments to change use categories. We don't need to help
developers make more profits. We need to address our urgent housing needs. Here are 75 units that it looks like you
might be willing to eliminate. Why? It makes no sense to me.

Thank you,

The purchase of the President Hotel and the displacement of 75 households is a disgrace. PA needs households.
Mountain View and Menlo Park pay more attention to supporting their populations then we do.

PA does not need any more luxury hotels, in fact we don't need more hotels (or retail space) we need places for folks to
live. Not just low cost residences but apartments to support the community stores and restaurants.

The Weekly story about how the purchase of the hotel went forward was an eye opener, it is an indication of a counsel
asleep at he the wheel.

Let’s stop kidding ourselves shall we? The scales have fallen off the eyes of the “no-growth,” “slow growth” “and “fast-growth”

in doing so lose forever 75 units of rental housing. We just have to call you out on this.

If you really believe in supporting housing in Palo Alto, please do not let AJ Capital and friends bully you into changing the laws to
benefit the vested interests. Those neighbors got kicked out of homes in which they had lived, some for as long as 30 years, and are
under some kind of gag order now. Which is repugnant enough. Well two wrongs don’t make a right. Vote "no" tomorrow night on
Agenda Item 16.

Also, do you recall when you voted a "Free" upzone to Windy Hill - the owners of 2755 ECR? Do you think that precedent encouraged
AJ to try for their own developer giveaway? If so, well let's get off this slippery slope straightaway by Voting "no" on 16, and halt further
erosion of trust in our system. "People first," remember that. You've said it yourselves a dozen times. So let's see you put your money

The capitulation to A.J. Capital and the back room dealings with this entity revealed in the Palo Alto Weekly are appalling
to me.

You members of City Council who drone on about the need for more housing in Palo Alto (without seriously getting
behind limiting office and commercial development downtown) have completely revealed yourselves as hypocrites.

There is already "housing" at the President Hotel. People have lived there happily for decades.

I used to be proud to live in Palo Alto. Its tree lined streets reminded me of my Ohio neighborhood growing up.

Now we see more and more corruption. Formerly our city council members were just people who wanted to do a public
service. Some of them went on to elected office in the county or the state. But most of them just served and did their
best.

Now our elections feature blue‐bin filling expensive mailers. And who pays for these? People who want to influence
our city council members for their financial gain.

And former members of staff ‐ looking at you Steve Emslie ‐ go on to use their insider knowledge of the levers of power
in the city to take on lucrative work with the same carpetbaggers now involved in making this town a less and less livable
place.

If there is any hope of saving the President Hotel for affordable housing, please vote that way.

Honorable Palo Alto City Council Members,

Please maintain the President's Hotel Apartments as apartments and DO NOT repeal, change, or pass any of the 4 laws

Palo Alto needs more lower cost housing and not more hotels.

It is morally abhorrent that our city council and staff has allowed the recent President's Hotel Apartments residents to
be evicted and paid off for their silence in order to create another hotel to profit a developer at the expense of current
residents; this includes not only those evicted, but the rest of us citywide that pay rent, enjoy the company of those who
pay rent, or who have any compassion at all for our fellow townspeople.

Not only should city council and staff make no law changes to further the conversion of the apartments to a hotel, you
and staff should pursue legal action to secure the apartments as low cost apartments in perpetuity and invite back those
already evicted.

The evictions and apparent back room dealings and stealth law making are an absolute embarrassment to all of those
who call Palo Alto our home.

I look to you, our council members, to right these past wrongs, or at least push the proceedings off until the new council
is installed next year, as changing laws to help a developer at the expense of current residents should not be done
during a lame duck session.

Thank you for your compassionate consideration of my remarks.

To members of the City Council,

Please don't allow the developer who bought the President Hotel to bulldoze 75 apartments and force established,
middle‐class, long term members of our community out of their homes in the midst of a record housing shortage. In
addition to the individual impacts on the residents, the message you will send to developers, which seems to be the
message you're sending with all your proposals to encourage housing, is that developers should be able to violate all the
housing code rules that have made Palo Alto such a desirable place to live.

Gutting size and density limits, eliminating special restrictions on buildings that don't meet current building codes,
allowing wildly unrealistic parking requirements and weakening rules to protect homeowners access to light ‐‐ these
proposed changes are bad enough.
Combined with your demonstrated preferential interest in meeting with developers rather than residents, I can't help
but question your motivation and even your integrity. Though I have not attended the recent meetings, news coverage
has suggested that some of you are inclined to move forward with these giveaways despite expert opinion that they
probably won't increase the supply of affordable housing.

There must be better way to encourage affordable housing. Please take the time to find it!

Sincerely,

Dedra Hauser

Hello City Council,

I've been appalled to learn about the stealth dealings and quickie law changes that are in the works for the developers of
the President Hotel. Please stop this! Please give the citizens of Palo Alto the courtesy of listening to their concerns
about changing residences to hotel rooms, and the courtesy of making the business that goes before the Council
transparent. I didn't vote people in to deal behind my back.

We're all counting on you to deal ethically with the citizens of Palo Alto; please start doing it.

Thank you,

To City Council members: It is unbelievable to me that you might move to concede to the requests being made
by AJ Capital. To do so would lend approval to the worst kind of political scheming and pressure politics that
should be beneath the standards expected of our elected officials. The nefarious activities of certain council
members and city staff regarding this whole issue have now been well publicized and echo some of the lack of
morality and ethics we have been seeing in our nation’s capital.

Should the council take actions to knuckle under to the pressures and threats being forwarded by AJ Capital
and its advisors, it will certainly give immense further credibility to those who argue that many on the council
are in the pocket of the development community. I urge you to regain your ethical balance and resist this shady
deal.

Subject:          Zoning Changes - 'critical for preserving "public health, safety and welfare." On what basis? who
                  makes this decision?



Dear City Council -
I was surprised to read in a local newspaper that a justification for accelerating proposed zoning
change was 'for preserving "public health, safety and welfare."

(From Palo Alto Online: Also, zone changes are typically vetted by the Planning and Transportation
Commission before going to the council. In this case, staff deemed the removal of the
"grandfather facility" provision critical for preserving "public health, safety and welfare."
As such, it is going straight to council for approval on a temporary basis (the planning commission
would later consider a permanent change).

If the decision was made to preserve "public health, safety and welfare.", was one of the City of Palo
Alto's Health and Safety professionals consulted to make this assessment?

Or, was this a Staff decision made without health, safety and welfare experts to consider the
impact? Who on Staff approved this justification? what specific health, safety and welfare concerns
were cited? and what was the justification for these concerns and how would accerating the zoning
changes preserve "public health, safety and welfare."?

These are critical questions to answer. People who deal with public and workforce safety know that
the trust of people is essential for safety programs to work - if "safety" is used as an administrative
lever to accelerate an administrative end, peoples safety will be compromised. The Boy Who Cried
Wolf.

I am very interested in knowing the safety issues in this process and the qualification of the personnel
who are making the safety decisions.

This report overflows with facts..... and leaves the future up to thousands and
thousands of leaders.

How to influence the flow of capital is the issue for me. Tonight Palo Alto
City Council has the classic option of converting an apartment once full of
moderate income tenants.

What fate awaits the investor vs the tenants? Our nine councilpersons are
searching for levers to balance the scale of social justice.....or follow the flow
of capital.


The apartments named President Hotel could not be more appropriate. Palo Alto as a whole is not
distressed economically, but some citizens are really stressed.

Too many people are ready to pull a housing lever and surge housing. There is no obvious lever for
infrastructure capital to match housing surge. There is no credible housing for displaced tenants for
the President Hotel.

Subject:           Presidents Hotel and Other Similar Properties



Dear Council Members,

I read with dismay the most recent attempt to cater to developer interests over the interests of residents of
Palo Alto, particular those residents who are not affluent. Of course I speak of the proposed changes that
would allow the Presidents Hotel which currently provides affordable housing to be converted to a boutique
hotel.

I don't know when it was that the tide turned at the offices of City staff. Perhaps it was the appointment of
City Manager Jim Keene, or perhaps they were simply taking their cue from some members of the Council ‐‐
current and former. The latest last minute "emergency" call to change ordnances already on the books to
protect housing for those who would otherwise be priced out of the market is simply the latest example of a
City government that says one thing about housing, but then does quite another.

Those of you on the Council who have called for great developer incentives to provide housing, cloaking your
arguments in the mystical and wholly unsupported view that building primarily market rate housing is really
an attempt to provide more affordable housing, now have a pretty stark choice. Either you are in favor of
maintaining and creating more affordable housing, or you are not. You can either protect the affordable
housing we have, or you can vote once again in favor of developers and against the best interests of the
neediest citizens among us.

All residents are watching what you do. It is two years until the next election when some of you will be
seeking re‐election and some of you may hope to move on to other offices. That is a long time, and much
damage can be done in the meantime. But we have long memories. The voters spoke at the last election, but
you are not listening. Palo Alto, one of the smartest communities in the country, deserves creative solutions
and not the tired old arguments that turn wonderful communities into canyons of concrete blocks and little
sense of community. We can do better.

I urge you to protect the Presidents Hotel among other currently available affordable housing units.

Sincerely,
Carol Scott
Resident of Evergreen Park

Subject:             President Hotel - loss of 75 affordable housing units - what?!


Dear City Council,

I am dismayed that the City of Palo Alto is poised to allow AJ Capital to decrease Palo Alto's stock of affordable housing
at a time when we are trying to add 300 housing units this year. How can we let something like this happen? As I
understand it, AJ Capital would have been restricted to continue using the President Hotel as housing and not able to
convert it to hotel space. However, there is some existing provision that needs to be adjusted for their needs--to allow
them to proceed with the conversion to hotel rooms over desperately needed housing.

In addition, AJ Capital wants the city council to allow them to skip paying the parking fees since they won't be able to
provide adequate parking for their hotel. If the City Council allows AJ Capital a variance on this request, I will lose even
more faith in my elected representatives when it comes to controlling traffic congestion and providing adequate parking so
that it doesn't spill over into our residential neighborhoods. The fees that AJ Capital should pay for parking would go a
long ways towards the planned parking garages. The City should collect what is rightfully due to them.

Thanks for considering my concerns.

Sincerely,

Susan Kemp

Honorable Council Members,

I am so confused. I cannot understand why AJ Capital would be granted an exception to the ordinance on change of use or
why exempting AJ Capital from $13M in in‐lieu parking fees would even be considered.

I can guess that AJ Capital would sue the City if precluded from the proposed conversion. And I can guess that the revenue to
the City would be much greater from a hotel than from housing.

Even so, when Palo Alto is so far behind it’s own housing goals and when any new housing faces immense hurdles, even in
high‐density areas, why is losing 75 affordable, walkable, downtown residences being given so much runway?

DECEMBER 10, 2018, CITY COUNCIL MEETING, AGENDA ITEM #16
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDING MUNICIPAL CODE SECTION 18.18.120

CROSS REFERENCE: 488 UNIVERSITY AVENUE (PRESIDENT HOTEL)


Dear City Council:

I urge you to remove this item from your agenda, because the proposed
ordinance violates the Ralph M. Brown Act and the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA).

In addition, the proposed ordinance is an ordinance that increases
property owners development rights, requires two readings, and is subject
to referendum, while the findings and declarations in the proposed
ordinance includes language that is copied from California Government Code
Section 65858 that exists to authorize interim ordinances to prohibit a
property owner from using his or her property to protect the planning
process so that the property owner could not introduce potentially
nonconforming land uses that could defeat a later adopted Comprehensive
Plan or Zoning Ordinance.

Further, the staff report for this agenda item (ID # 9910) at Page 3 says,
“The proposed ordinance seeks to revert the Downtown non-complying
facilities regulations back to the pre-2016 standard”, and at Page 2 says,
“The change may have been unintentional and occurred in January 2016”, but
documents available in the City Clerk’s office and online demonstrate that
the language has existed in the Palo Alto Municipal Code since at least

                                                      1
2006, and I believe records available elsewhere will show that the
language has been in the Zoning Ordinance even earlier than that.



Brown Act Violation

The primary purpose of this proposed ordinance is to enable the conversion
of the property at 488 University Avenue from rental apartments to a
hotel.

The failure to include that fact in the agenda description is a violation
of the Brown Act.


CEQA Violation

CEQA Regulation 15378(a) defines “project” as the whole of an action,
which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in
the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in
the environment”, including “(1) An activity undertaken by any public
agency.”

CEQA Regulation 15378(d) says, “Where the Lead Agency could describe the
project as either the adoption of a particular regulation under
subdivision (a)(1) or as a development proposal which will be subject to
several governmental approvals .. the Lead Agency shall describe the
project as the development proposal for the purpose of environmental
analysis.

Therefore, the CEQA project is the proposed conversion of 488 University
Avenue from apartments to a hotel, and the regulation in the subject
agenda item is part of that CEQA project.

Segmenting this agenda item from the CEQA analysis of the development
project is a violation of CEQA and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

The project is not exempt from CEQA under either of reasons given in the
agenda description and staff report.

The reasons why the project is not exempt are included in the arguments in
July 27, 2018, letter from Heather Minner of Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger
LLP that appears in the Public Letters to Council in the August 13, 2018,
City Council Agenda Packet on pages 90-96 at:
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?t=45470.91&
BlobID=66185



Palo Alto Municipal Code Section 18.18.120(b)(2).


                                     2
The proposed ordinance seeks to delete language in PAMC Section 18.18.120
that the Planning Director claims was added to the Municipal Code
inadvertently in error by means of cutting and pasting the language from
someplace else, although he is careful in not citing the source of the
“cut-and-paste” language because there is none.

The language in question has been part of the Municipal Code continuously
since at least 2006 when the Council adopted Ordinance No. 4923, and I
believe that the same language has been in the Municipal Code continuously
longer than that, but due to a gap in the City Clerk’s records I was
unable to verify that fact today, but I believe there are other records
that confirm my belief and I will let you know that as soon as I am able
to access those records.

The language that staff proposes to delete is at Page 64 of Ordinance No.
4923 introduced October 16, 2006, adopted November 6, 2006, and effective
December 7, 2006, or twelve years ago, and is available online at:
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/19591.

I realize that there may be further actions on the subject of this agenda
item in other forums.

Therefore, I will be proving a copy of this letter to the City Clerk with
a certified copy attached of Ordinance No. 4923 for inclusion in the
Public Letters to Council in the next City Council Agenda Packet, and for
the Administrative Record of these proceedings and other proceedings
regarding 488 University Avenue.

Sincerely,


Herb Borock

Warm greetings,

Having lived now 3 years at 345 Forest Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301 and overlooking the lovely 1930s
fountain and little courtyard I have seen hundreds of people stop and gaze from various angles at this
courtyard and wonderful building.

Any type of extension to the current size of the traffic light - small as the Telecom firm will
claim it to be - is directly IN THE VIEW of one of the most photographed local landmarks.

The role of the ARB has to be to defend the beauty of our city and small or large add-on contraptions
have NO PLACE at this location.

The Crown Castle/Verizon applicant is proposing a node at Forest/Gilman. Let them know that they
can keep their nodes away from blocking/changing the view (be it even slightly) of our town!

Sincerely,

Ardan Michael Blum

The Academy of Pediatrics Recommendations about Cell Phones, Cell Towers
and Wireless
  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the largest US medical association of
pediatricians and pediatric specialists, recommends that the US government tighten
wireless exposure limits and that the public reduce children’s exposure to cell phones
and other devices that emit wireless radiation.

   In 2016, the AAP issued a press release about the U.S National Toxicology Program
research findings of cancerous tumors found in rats exposed to cell phone radiation. The
Academy’s website HealthyChild.org then publicly issued new recommendations to reduce
children’s exposure to wireless radiation.
   In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) strongly supported the Cell Phone
Right to Know Act H.R. 6358, federal legislation that would have informed the American
public that wireless devices expose consumers to radiofrequency microwave radiation
exposures. This legislation would have authorized the US government to review the
scientific research on biological effects, initiate research on electromagnetic fields and
develop safety standards by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The official position of the AAP is documented in three letters they sent to government
officials. The letters describe children’s unique vulnerability to wireless radiation and
call on the federal government to review and tighten radiation standards for wireless
devices in order to protect pregnant women and children’s health.
   In 2012, the AAP sent a letter in support of the newly proposed Right To Know federal
legislation. In 2012, the AAP wrote a letter to the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) calling for it to open up a review of radiofrequency limits.
    In 2013, after the FCC opened up “Reassessment of Exposure to Radiofrequency
Electromagnetic Fields Limits and Policies” the AAP submitted a letter to the FCC with their
official comment.
                                                              1
    In 2012, the AAP published Pediatric Environmental Health, the AAP Textbook of
Children’s Environmental Health and Chapter 41 is about Electromagnetic Fields.
   AAP Recommendations:
• Avoid carrying your phone against the body like in a pocket, sock, or bra. Cell phone
manufacturers can’t guarantee that the amount of radiation you’re absorbing will be at a
safe level.
• When talking on the cell phone, try holding it an inch or more away from your head.
• Use text messaging when possible, and use cell phones in speaker mode or with the use
of hands-free kits.
• Make only short or essential calls on cell phones.
• If you plan to watch a movie on your device, download it first, then switch to airplane
mode while you watch in order to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.
• Avoid making calls in cars, elevators, trains, and buses. The cell phone works harder to
get a signal through metal, so the power level increases.
• Remember that cell phones are not toys or teething items.

AAP on Cell Tower Radiation: “In recent years, concern has increased about exposure to
radio frequency electromagnetic radiation emitted from cell phones and phone station
antennae. An Egyptian study confirmed concerns that living nearby mobile phone
base stations increased the risk for developing:
   Headaches,      Memory problems,        Dizziness,
   Depression,      Sleep problems
   Short-term exposure to these fields in experimental studies have not always shown
negative effects, but this does not rule out cumulative damage from these fields, so larger
studies over longer periods are needed to help understand who is at risk. In large studies,
an association has been observed between symptoms and exposure to these fields in the
everyday environment.”

Good morning Angela,

It was great meeting you last night at the Menlo Park Caltrain meeting. I had proposed the idea of closing
the Palo Alto Ave rail crossing in Palo Alto, and taking Alma directly across the creek between Menlo Park
and Palo Alto. I had also suggested moving the small El Palo Alto Park to the other side of the tracks, and
extend the El Camino Park.

This idea would: a) eliminate the cost of another grade separation, b) eliminate train noise wrt to current
crossing, and c) lower the number of track crossings, between Menlo Park and Palo Alto.

Please let me know, if I can help you explain this idea to Menlo Park and/or Palo Alto stake holders.

Thanks again,

Martin

My husband and I urge you:

To reverse your May 21st decision allowing Verizon to install its cheap, ugly and potentially hazardous
equipment aboveground next to people’s homes;

To direct City Staff to vigorously enforce Palo Alto’s aesthetics, noise and other ordinances with
respect to the siting and installation of cell towers near residences; and, more specifically,

To direct City Staff to stop advising the Planning and Transportation Commission to incorporate the
FCC’s aggressively pro-telecommunications-industry October order into our municipal ordinances.

Subject:           City Staff pressing PTC to get with the telecom industry's program



Dear Mayor Kniss, Vice-Mayor Filseth and Council Members DuBois, Fine, Holman, Kou, Scharff,
Tanaka and Wolbach,

I am writing to urge you to direct City Staff to stop advising the Planning and Transportation
Commission to incorporate into Palo Alto’s municipal ordinances the current administration FCC’s
October order establishing, among other things, $270 per year as the maximum pole rental fee for
neighborhood cell tower equipment.

The PTC will be considering this recommendation at its meeting tomorrow, Wednesday, December
12th, 2018.

It is impossible to imagine that what City Staff is advising the PTC to do could be of benefit to Palo
Alto’s residents.

New York, Seattle, Portland, Denver, San Jose and dozens of other cities are resisting the order and
suing the FCC over it.

Moreover, to reduce fire hazards, the California PUC just initiated the process of establishing rules
that ultimately will require the undergrounding of many utility poles.

In this context, how can it make sense for City Staff to recommend to the PTC that they codify
allowing these poles to be loaded up with heavy cell tower equipment, let alone codify renting space
on the poles for the pittance of $270 a year?

Please consider what is best for residents and direct City Staff to stop advising the PTC to needlessly
lock Palo Alto into a bad policy that aggressively favors the telecommunications industry at the
expense of the people who live here.

Sincerely,


Jeanne Fleming

Via Email Correspondence


Molly Stump, Esq.
City of Palo Alto City Attorney
250 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto, CA 94301

           RE:   Demand for Reconsideration of City Council Vote on Verizon Cell Tower Applications


Dear Ms. Stump:


This letter demands that the City Council reconsider its May 21, 2018 decision to deny my appeal of

the Planning Department’s prior approval of eleven permits to install Verizon cellular telephone towers

in residential neighborhoods (see 5/21/18 Council Agenda Item #6) because this City decision may

have been tainted by a conflict of interest and illegal “gifts.”



As you certainly are aware, CTO Jonathan Reichental has come under severe scrutiny recently for

accepting free trips and fees from the telecommunications industry and for not properly disclosing

those “gifts” and this income on his annual financial disclosure statements (FPPC Form 700). After

accepting these over-the-limit gifts and undisclosed fees from the telecommunications industry, he then

evidently used his official position as Palo Alto’s CTO to influence City decisions on

telecommunications issues on behalf of telecommunications companies – most likely including the

decision of the Planning Department and City Council to approve Vinculums/Verizon’s first round of

                                                          1
applications to install in residential neighborhoods cell towers with hundreds of pounds of ancillary

equipment located aboveground. In fact, the California Fair Political Practices Commission (“FPPC”)

is currently investigating whether Mr. Reichental violated the disclosure and disqualification provisions

of the ethics laws. If found in violation of these laws, he could face fines of thousands of dollars.



As the City’s Chief Technology Officer, Mr. Reichental is clearly aware of, and involved in, all City

decisions involving wireless communications, cellular telephone towers, etc. In particular, Mr.

Reichental leads the multi-department Connected Cities working group. This group continually

oversees telecommunications projects in the City, including—according to the Connected Cities

meeting agendas and minutes—overseeing Verizon’s applications to install cell towers. In fact, one of

Mr. Reichental’s juniors on his Connected Cities group—the Utilities Department’s Jim Fleming (no

relation to me)—advised City Council regarding the Verizon applications at the May 21, 2018, appeals

hearing. Moreover, Mr. Reichental sits on the Joint Venture Silicon Valley Wireless Communications

Initiative Committee, which submitted a brief opposing my appeal of the Planning Department’s

decision. (Joint Venture Silicon Valley receives financial support from AT&T, Crown Castle and

Verizon, all of whom have submitted applications to the City of Palo Alto to install cell towers.) It is

therefore very likely that Mr. Reichental “used his official position to influence” the decision, in

violation of the law. (See Cal. Govt. Code section 87103.)



Reconsidering the decision and giving the public and the City Council the opportunity to discuss

whether Mr. Reichental’s transgressions warrant a change in the decision is clearly appropriate under

these circumstances. In fact, a new hearing on the appeal is warranted in order to protect my due

process rights as an appellant. (See Clark v. City of Hermosa Beach (1996) 48 Cal. App. 4th 1152

[party was deprived a fair hearing because city official was unable to exercise “disinterested skill, zeal
                                                     2
and diligence” due to his personal interest in decision].) Moreover, the law clearly states that a City

Council decision can be overturned based on the improper involvement of a City employee who hid his

personal financial interest in the decision. (Cal. Govt. Code section 91003(b).)



In sum, Mr. Reichental’s possible acceptance of over-the-limit gifts and undisclosed fees from the

telecommunications industry may have tainted the City’s review of the Vinculums/Verizon

applications and therefore warrants reconsideration by the City Council. Thank you for your prompt

response to this request.



Sincerely,


Jeanne Fleming

   Human Rights Day About Fluoride in Tap Water
   by Paul Connett, PhD,
   Director                                        Today, December 10, is
   Human Rights Day. It commemorates the day in 1948 when the United
   Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights.

   * Fluoride puts a medical treatment in tap water without informed
   consent
   * The interests and welfare of the individual should have priority over
   the sole interest of science or society.
   * Fluoride is world’s longest-running medical experiment
   * An individual’s informed consent has priority over any other authority
   .
   Fluoridation and Human Rights
      For many people the strongest argument against fluoridation is that it
   is a violation of the individual’s right to informed consent to medical
   treatment, and that is a human right. No government (local, state or
   federal) should have the right to add chemicals to the drinking water
   designed to treat human beings as opposed to treating the water to make it
   safe or palatable to drink. Every doctor and dentist should know this but few
   seem to care. But on Humans Right day it is time to remind them.
   For starters look at the language in the 2005 UNESCO Declaration on
   Bioethics and Human Rights. Here is some of that language and we have
   underlined the principles that highlight the violations of human rights
   inherent in water fluoridation:

           Principles

           Within the scope of this Declaration, in decisions or practices taken or
           carried out by those to whom it is addressed, the following principles

                                                    1
      are to be respected.

      Article 3 – Human dignity and human rights
      1. Human dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms are to be
      fully respected.
      2. The interests and welfare of the individual should have priority
      over the sole interest of science or society.

      Article 6 – Consent
      1. Any preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic medical intervention is
      only to be carried out with the prior, free and informed consent of
      the person concerned, based on adequate information. The consent
      should, where appropriate, be express and may be withdrawn by the
      person concerned at any time and for any reason without disadvantage
      or prejudice.

      2. Scientific research should only be carried out with the prior,
      free, express and informed consent of the person concerned. The
      information should be adequate, provided in a comprehensible form
      and should include modalities for withdrawal of consent. Consent may
      be withdrawn by the person concerned at any time and for any reason
      without any disadvantage or prejudice. Exceptions to this principle
      should be made only in accordance with ethical and legal standards
      adopted by States, consistent with the principles and provisions set out
      in this Declaration, in particular in Article 27, and international human
      rights law.

      3. In appropriate cases of research carried out on a group of persons or
      a community, additional agreement of the legal representatives of the
      group or community concerned may be sought. In no case should a
      collective community agreement or the consent of a community
      leader or other authority substitute for an individual’s informed
      consent.

Doubtless, promoters of fluoridation will point out that principles 2 and 3
pertain to “research” and they will argue that fluoridation is not research; that
its benefits and efficacy were “proved” years ago. However, they can’t have
it both ways, whenever a study shows a serious harm (like the U.S.
government funded- Bashash et al, 2017 and 2018 studies) the promoters’
response is to call for more studies.

Calling for more studies is tantamount to admitting that their case has NOT
been proved and that fluoridation is one of the world’s longest-running


                                                2
medical experiments. The earliest promoters of fluoridation understood this
that is why they insisted that the fluoridation 1945 “trials” in Grand Rapids,
MI and Newburgh, NY were “demonstrations” not “experiments.”

Sadly, the world is not run on ethical principles, but for one day a year – Dec
10 - perhaps we can pretend that it is. For the rest of the year – as far as
fighting fluoridation is concerned it is a relief that the hard science is on our
side. Our biggest problem – especially in 2019 - is trying to let the public and
the media know that this is the case. We have to make the “invisible” visible
to the public, and then in court.

                                  October‐November Update

           CASA — The Committee to House the Bay Area — Compact
           Status Report

           Staff briefed the Executive Board on the CASA effort and
           areas of agreement for the CASA Compact and asked for
           the Board's input and discussion. By the end of 2018,
           CASA will have engaged a broad range of stakeholders to
           develop a suite of recommendations for legislative reform,
           new revenue, and regional leadership. These
           recommendations will be packaged into the CASA
           Compact for consideration by ABAG, MTC and myriad state and local policy makers.

           The current schedule calls for the CASA Compact to be finalized by mid-December. If the
           schedule holds, the ABAG Executive Board in January and the MTC Commission in
           December would consider authorizing the President and Chair to sign the CASA Compact.

           CASA includes leaders from across the Bay Area who will build actionable political
           consensus around (1) increasing housing production at all levels of affordability, (2)
           preserving existing affordable housing, and (3) protecting vulnerable populations from
           housing instability and displacement for consideration by ABAG,MTC and myriad.

           CASA is being led by three Co-Chairs: Fred Blackwell, The San Francisco Foundation;
           Leslye Corsiglia, Silicon Valley at Home; and Michael Covarrubias, TMG Partners. It is
           structured around a Steering Committee and Technical Committee composed of local
           elected officials, thought leaders, and policy experts from across the region. The CASA

consultants. More information about CASA is available here.



New Executive Director Recruitment Underway

The Metropolitan Transportation
Commission (MTC) is recruiting for a new
Executive Director, who will report directly to
the MTC Commission, and be responsible
for the administration of more than $2 billion
per year in funding for the operation,
maintenance and expansion of the Bay
Area’s surface transportation network. Under
contract with the ABAG, the MTC Executive Director also provides staffing and support
services to ABAG. The next Executive Director must be an exceptional leader with an
unflappable presence and the ability to respond to the region's challenges, both
strategically and tactically.

A MTC Executive Director Selection Committee (EDSC) and an ABAG Committee will
both review the nominations. Current Executive Director Steve Heminger is retiring in
February of 2019. More information is available here.



Next Steps: Looking at Governance

                                                  Pursuant to its joint 2017 action by ABAG
                                                  and MTC to consolidate staffs, both
                                                  agencies also agreed to explore pontential
                                                  consolidation of the governing bodies. As a

                                                  outside consulting firm will begin examining
Joint ABAG Executive Board Meeting and MTC        the governance structures of many regional
Commission - Approval of Plan Bay Area 2040       planning agencies with a focus on those
                                                  with both land use and transportation
                                                  planning powers and responsibilities. To
                                                  initiate the process, a Board
                                                  and Commission working group has
                                                  already met with staff and Management
                                                  Partners.


The collected information will inform the ABAG Executive Board and the MTC
Commission. A final report is due in June 2019. The Board and Commission will then



                                              2
discuss whether the two agencies should restructure their governing boards to better
serve the region and to better utilize the consolidated staff. Both ABAG and MTC retain
the decision on whether or not to merge the two governing boards.



Bay Area Cities Permitted More Housing in 2017, Acute Shortfall
of Affordable Housing Still Exists


New data on housing.abag.ca.gov
reveals Bay Area cities and
counties permitted 27,103 new
housing units in 2017, more than
either 2016 (20,868) or 2015
(20,495); but only 18 percent of
these units were for very-low-, low-
or moderate-income residents --
far below the 58 percent required
by the state's Housing and
Community Development
Department. A new report
summarizing the 2017 data, is
available
on https://abag.ca.gov/planning/housing/publications.html. as Bay Area Housing Permit
Activity Report, 2015-2017.

"With this new data, we can clearly see that more housing development is on the way, but
we're still far behind in meeting the housing demand for all income levels," commented
ABAG President and Sonoma County Supervisor David Rabbitt. "The work that is being
done at ABAG and at MTC in the Committee to House the Bay Area, known as CASA, is
urgently needed to bring Bay Area leaders together to solve this problem."

The housing data portal now includes complete datasets for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017;
and will continue to be updated to incorporate cities' and counties' housing permit and
policy activities in future years. These datasets provide a resource to shape both the
development and evaluation of Bay Area governments' housing policies, and will help
support the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)'s funding initiatives.

These initiatives include the One Bay Area Grant program and the new Housing Incentive
Pool challenge grant program that are linked to cities' and counties' results in permitting,
producing and preserving housing. MTC established the Housing Incentive Pool to reward
local governments that permit or preserve the greatest number of housing units at the
moderate-, low- and very-low income levels. (see related story below)



MTC Offers Cities, Counties Big Carrot to Spur Affordable
Housing




                                             3
                                   Taking a bold step to ease the Bay Area’s persistent
                                   shortage of affordable housing, MTC will be distributing
                                   $71 million of Housing Incentive Pool funds, or HIP for
                                   short, to reward with transportation infrastructure dollars
                                   the cities and counties that over the nemoney on a per-
                                   unit basis to the 15 jurisdictions that issue certificates of
                                   occupancy for the greatest number of eligible housing
                                   units — both newly-built and preserved as affordable to
                                   low-, very-low- and moderate-income households over
                                   the five calendar years 2018 through 2022. These grants
will be awarded only after the fifth year of the HIP time period.

As part of the HIP initiative, MTC is establishing a pilot program through which cities and
counties can compete for $5 million in grants for infrastructure improvements around
affordable housing developments. The Commission and staff in partnership with county
congestion management agencies will develop guidelines for this program over the
coming months.

HIP is a housing $76 million grant program, that awards transportation infrastructure
dollars to cities and counties that over the next five years produce or preserve the largest
number of affordable housing units in designated Priority Development Areas or in Transit
Priority Areas. These are areas that cities and counties have identified as preferred
locations for new homes, job growth and other investment, or that are near transit hubs.

The HIP commitment includes $46 million in state funds administered by MTC through the
Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) plus $30 million in flexible federal
funds through the second round of the Commission’s One Bay Area Grant (OBAG 2)
program.

“The idea is to incentivize the construction and preservation of affordable housing,” said
Steve Heminger, executive director of both ABAG and MTC. “We are trying to
encourage…whoever can do it, large (jurisdiction) or small.”

MTC and ABAG established several other eligibility criteria for the HIP program as well:
   Preserved affordable housing units must either be subsidized multifamily properties
     that have been identified by the California Housing Partnership Corp. as being at
     high or very-high risk of conversion to market-rate rents, or multifamily properties
     with affordable-but-unrestricted rents on which new long-term rent restrictions have
     been placed.
   A preserved affordable housing unit with deed restrictions running at least 55 years
     will be counted as one HIP unit. Units with shorter-term deed restrictions will receive
     a pro-rated share of a single HIP unit based on this 55-year standard.
   Newly-constructed units must be deed-restricted for continued affordability to low-,
     very-low or moderate-income households.
   To be eligible for HIP funding, each city or county must have its overall Housing
     Elements certified by the California Department of Housing and Community
     Development, and also demonstrate compliance with state housing laws related to
     surplus lands, accessory dwelling units and density bonuses. Self-certification
     through a local resolution is allowed to demonstrate compliance with these final
     three requirements.




                                               4

San Franicsco Estuary Partnership Hosts National Estuary
Program Conference




Every fall, staff from the 28 National Estuary Programs (NEP)
gather together in one estuary to transfer knowledge, share
stories and tools, and advance collaborative opportunities, at
the NEP Fall Tech Transfer Meeting. This past October, SFEP
had the great pleasure of hosting the annual meeting.
Staff from NEPs from around the country as well as staff from
US EPA headquarters and three regional offices attended the
Meeting. The agenda included presentations from NEPs on
various topics during tech transfer sessions, an afternoon boat
tour, a panel presentation on integrating environmental justice into the work of NEPs, field
visits to restoration sites around the Bay, and a collaboration with the Exploratorium with
estuary-themed presentations and interactive demonstrations for their “After Dark” series.
According to Caitlin Sweeney, San Francisco Estuary Partnership Director, "The Fall NEP
meeting is a great opportunity to focus on the benefits of the national program. The NEPs
successfully leverage funds to focus on local capacity building informed by national
priorities. NEPs address issues of national importance with a unique non-regulatory
collaborative approach and direct engagement with the community. Our model is unique
and successful and the NEPs take great pride in the work that we are able to accomplish."



Earthquake Guides Show Ways to Lessen Damage

                                                  An online tool is now available to help
                                                  residents identify potential earthquake-
                                                  related damage to their homes and
                                                  provides information on how to gird against
                                                  the next big temblor.

                                                  The Earthquake Home Quiz can be
                                                  accessed at ABAG Resilience Program's
                                                  website at homequakequiz.org, along with
                                                   a downloadable PDF of the Earthquake



Field Guide to help assess potential impacts of
earthquakes. The new Earthquake Field Guide was
released to coincide with the 10th Annual Great
California ShakeOut on Oct. 18, a statewide
preparedness event.

"The time to prepare is now," said David Rabbitt, ABAG
president and member of the California Seismic Safety
Commission. "We are in earthquake country and it's just
a matter of time before we are affected in some way,
whether small or large. The quiz is an engaging, new
way to see what the effects might be and lays the
groundwork for preparedness."

The U.S. Geological Survey has determined there is a 72 percent chance of at least one
earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater striking somewhere in the Bay Area in the next 30
years. It's the continual movement of the Earth's plates against each other that causes
energy to build. When the plates slip, energy is released and earthquakes result. In the
Bay Area's case, it's the Pacific Plate moving northwest past the North American Plate
that puts pressure along the faults in the region.

The quiz allows residents to gain insight into seismic safety, whether they are in a single-
family home, apartment building or mobile home. The types of housing in the region are
as diverse as the Bay Area itself and the quiz allows residents to explore the resilience of
their particular type of home.

The release of these online tools come in the wake of updated ABAG estimates of
housing losses in the region as a result of a large-scale earthquake. The ABAG data tell a
compelling and personal story about the Bay Area's potential future after an earthquake:
How many buildings will be damaged? How many households will be displaced? And how
many residents will be seeking shelter? Visit resilience.abag.ca.gov/housing/losses to
review the findings and connect with the data behind the numbers.

ABAG's newest estimates of housing losses provide a significant update to the last such
data released in 2003, with the latest figures reflecting current housing stock and the Bay
Area's present population.

The figures use the most recent modeling techniques to identify potential residential
housing losses for 16 plausible earthquake scenarios in the Bay Area. Under the most
dramatic scenario, a 7.8-magnitude quake along all the northern segments of the San



                                              6
Andreas Fault, 68,900 residential buildings would be rendered uninhabitable, while
causing $28.4 billion in residential building damage alone.

Under this scenario, San Mateo would have the largest number of uninhabitable
residential buildings at 19,300; followed by San Francisco at 18,300; Santa Clara at
15,500; Alameda at 8,300; Marin at 3,100; Sonoma at 2,400; Contra Costa at 1,400;
Solano at 400; and Napa at 200. In all, 68,900 buildings would be uninhabitable.

To the City Council,




The Palo Weekly said it all last Friday. This lack of transparency, manipulation, and former staff
members involved in this deal, etc.

There is a huge lack of trust in this Council, residents who elected you are not being consulted or
listened to. Examples, road changes (Atascadero, Ross Rd etc.) are not consulted or asked for their
input as to what is needed or NOT needed, the President Hotel being the latest. This sure reminds
me of a mini Washington D.C. Is that what we want?



Please let the next Council work on this, do not change the zoning. You say you want
low/moderate income folks to have housing, well the President was

just that. A new luxury hotel does not do that, plus it will increase parking congestion. Your words
and actions do not match. Read some of the comments beneath the editorial to get more informed
about what we feel.




From the Editorial

"There is legitimate room for debate on each of these proposed changes had they come before the
city in an appropriate and transparent way, followed normal procedures for consideration by the
planning commission and absent a manipulative tenant agreement designed to take advantage of
and buy the silence of the tenants. The involvement of former senior-level city staff members as paid
consultants to A.J. Capital has done nothing but raise suspicions of deals crafted behind the closed
doors of City Hall conference rooms.

                                                    1
A disingenuous attempt has been made to suggest it's merely a coincidence that these zoning
changes were scheduled for the final meetings of the year while citizens are distracted by the
holidays and a new seven-member City Council potentially less sympathetic to A.J. Capital will be
seated in January. (One, the downtown cap, has been moved to a January agenda, according to City
Manager Jim Keene.)

City staff, Mayor Liz Kniss and whomever else was involved were wrong to rush this proposal forward
and allow the city to become a supporting actor to the three-way deal A.J. Capital is trying to pull off.
Instead of facilitating a conversion in use that will sacrifice 75 units of housing for the creation of
another hotel, the city should instead be taking advantage of the current zoning rules to block this
conversion."

Hi,

I'm resending this to ensure it is included in the City Council packet for December 17th.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Dear City Council Members,

We support the Staff Report recommendation to not eliminate any grade separation alternatives at this
time. While the Viaduct is the least favored alternative, it remains worthy of further analysis because it is the
lowest cost and allows more connectivity than a Hybrid (which functions effectively as a wall).

In addition, we would like to propose an alternative that was mentioned previously: a short tunnel for
electrified trains, with freight remaining at the surface.

Please see the attached letter for further details.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

November	  12,	  2018	  
	  
	  
Subject:	  Recommendation	  of	  adding	  alternative	  of	  short	  tunnel	  for	  electrified	  trains	  only	  with	  
freight	  at	  the	  surface	  for	  Meadow	  and	  Charleston	  alternatives.	  	  
	  
	  
Dear	  City	  Council	  Members,	  	  
	  
We	  support	  the	  Staff	  Report	  recommendation	  to	  not	  eliminate	  any	  grade	  separation	  
alternatives	  at	  this	  time.	  While	  the	  Viaduct	  is	  the	  least	  favored	  alternative,	  it	  remains	  worthy	  of	  
further	  analysis	  because	  it	  is	  the	  lowest	  cost	  and	  allows	  more	  connectivity	  than	  a	  Hybrid	  (which	  
functions	  effectively	  as	  a	  wall).	  	  
	  
In	  addition,	  we	  would	  like	  to	  propose	  an	  alternative	  that	  was	  mentioned	  previously:	  a	  short	  
tunnel	  for	  electrified	  trains,	  with	  freight	  remaining	  at	  the	  surface.	  The	  slope,	  clearance,	  
ventilation	  and	  Fire	  Life	  Safety	  requirements	  driven	  by	  freight	  and	  other	  diesel	  trains	  in	  the	  
tunnels	  add	  significant	  costs	  to	  the	  tunnel	  proposal	  currently	  under	  consideration.	  	  Freight	  
tentatively	  remaining	  at	  the	  surface	  for	  the	  present	  would	  not	  liberate	  all	  of	  the	  ROW	  land	  for	  
other	  uses,	  but	  the	  vehicular	  crossing	  capacity	  issue	  would	  be	  addressed.	  	  	  
	  
A	  key	  condition	  has	  recently	  changed	  along	  the	  corridor	  making	  this	  a	  feasible	  alternative;	  
Caltrain	  is	  no	  longer	  considering	  running	  both	  diesel	  and	  electric	  trains	  and	  will	  now	  have	  a	  fully	  
electric	  fleet.	  In	  addition,	  the	  Dumbarton	  Rail	  project	  recently	  received	  approval	  to	  begin	  its	  
investigation	  of	  whether	  to	  rebuild	  the	  old	  rail	  bridge	  that	  formerly	  carried	  freight	  across	  the	  
Bay.	  	  If	  this	  came	  to	  fruition,	  freight	  might	  be	  partially	  or	  fully	  diverted	  to	  a	  Dumbarton	  route	  
and	  no	  longer	  pass	  through	  Palo	  Alto,	  leaving	  the	  right-­‐of-­‐way	  above	  the	  tunnel	  free	  for	  other	  
uses.	  	  	  
	  
We	  have	  identified	  a	  similar	  tunneling	  project,	  the	  San	  Francisco	  Central	  Subway	  Tunnel,	  
which	  seems	  to	  indicate	  that	  tunneling	  may	  even	  be	  much	  cheaper	  than	  a	  trench.	  	  
	  
HMM	  Trench	  Study:	  
	  
As	  you	  may	  recall,	  in	  2014,	  HMM	  gave	  a	  rough	  estimated	  cost	  for	  a	  trench	  below	  Meadow	  and	  
Charleston	  at	  $488	  Million	  (in	  2014	  dollars).	  	  
	  
Here	  was	  the	  breakdown:	  	  
	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2	  


	  




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	  
	  
	  
Central	  Subway	  Tunnel	  Without	  Freight	  
	  
Also	  in	  2014,	  the	  Central	  Subway	  project	  in	  San	  Francisco	  completed	  a	  1.7	  mile	  dual	  subway	  
tunnel	  using	  two	  20.7	  ft	  diameter	  tunnel	  boring	  machines	  (TBM).	  While	  the	  overall	  cost	  of	  the	  
project	  is	  very	  high,	  the	  vast	  majority	  of	  the	  cost	  is	  related	  to	  several	  very	  deep	  and	  complex	  
stations.	  The	  cost	  to	  complete	  the	  tunnel	  portion	  of	  the	  project:	  $234	  million	  dollars	  (2014	  
dollars).	  For	  reference,	  the	  distance	  from	  Loma	  Verde	  Ave	  to	  San	  Antonio	  Road	  in	  Palo	  Alto	  is	  
1.6	  miles.	  Palo	  Alto	  would	  likely	  have	  a	  additional	  costs	  beyond	  what	  was	  needed	  on	  the	  
subway	  project	  (signaling,	  larger	  diameter	  bore,	  etc.)	  but	  the	  price	  difference	  is	  worth	  
investigating	  and	  maybe	  minimal	  with	  the	  use	  of	  a	  single	  bore	  tunnel.	  
	  
Unlike	  Palo	  Alto’s	  right	  of	  way,	  these	  tunnels	  were	  built	  in	  densely	  urban	  San	  Francisco	  and	  
under	  an	  active	  BART	  line1.	  The	  TBMs	  went	  through	  various	  soils	  ranging	  from	  soft	  soils	  to	  
thinly	  bedded	  siltstone,	  shale	  and	  sandstone	  bedrock	  -­‐	  with	  some	  area	  designated	  as	  
“Potentially	  Gassy	  with	  Special	  Conditions”	  by	  Cal/OSHA2.	  The	  TBMs	  also	  had	  to	  navigate	  the

steep	  and	  turning	  alignment	  in	  an	  area	  where	  they	  dealt	  with	  low	  cover,	  nearby	  utilities,	  and	  
sensitive	  structures	  requiring	  analyses	  and	  precautions	  to	  limit	  settlement	  impact	  and	  ensure	  
the	  structures	  in	  downtown	  SF	  were	  safe.	  	  Given	  Palo	  Alto	  is	  in	  a	  suburban	  area	  with	  less	  
constraints,	  it	  seems	  reasonable	  to	  consider	  this	  alternative	  closely.	  	  
	  
Palo	  Alto	  Short	  Tunnel	  
	  
Another	  way	  to	  reduce	  the	  cost	  of	  a	  tunnel	  is	  to	  reduce	  the	  diameter.	  In	  2014,	  the	  High	  Speed	  
Rail	  Authority’s	  White	  Paper	  on	  Tunneling	  describes	  how	  they	  achieved	  significant	  cost	  
reductions	  by	  reducing	  maximum	  operating	  speeds	  assumptions	  in	  the	  tunnels	  from	  220	  mph	  
to	  200	  mph,	  thereby	  allowing	  them	  to	  reduce	  tunnel	  diameters	  from	  29.5’	  to	  28’	  ID	  (Inside	  
Diameter).	  3	  
	  
CARRD	  requested	  from	  AECOM	  information	  on	  the	  tunnel	  assumptions	  being	  used	  for	  the	  City	  
wide	  tunnel	  (which	  include	  freight)	  and	  they	  responded	  that	  they	  are	  using	  a	  “28	  ft	  Inside	  
Diameter	  Tunnel”	  which	  would	  large	  enough	  to	  allow	  200	  mph	  speeds.	  A	  significantly	  smaller	  
diameter	  would	  be	  required	  to	  accommodate	  planned	  speeds	  of	  110	  mph.	  And,	  as	  noted	  in	  our	  
previous	  public	  comment	  on	  height	  clearances,	  the	  Caltrain	  Electrification	  EIR	  specifically	  notes	  
that	  the	  clearance	  levels	  at	  the	  San	  Francisquito	  creek	  bridge	  (where	  freight	  passes	  today)	  is	  
actually	  19ft.	  It	  is	  therefore	  worth	  investigating	  whether	  the	  tunnel	  dimensions	  for	  a	  short,	  
electrified	  train	  only	  tunnel	  in	  Palo	  Alto	  where	  maximum	  speed	  for	  both	  Caltrain	  and	  HSR	  is	  110	  
miles	  per	  hour	  would	  allow	  us	  to	  have	  a	  tunnel	  diameter	  that	  is	  less	  than	  28’.	  	  
	  
Other	  key	  things	  to	  consider	  for	  the	  short	  tunnel	  with	  freight	  on	  the	  surface	  (EOT)	  option:	  	  
	  
       • Without	  freight,	  the	  1%	  grade	  requirement	  could	  more	  readily	  change	  to	  2%	  or	  even	  3%	  
             grade,	  which	  would	  allow	  for	  more	  design	  flexibility.	  
       • Caltrain	  and	  freight	  could	  continue	  operations	  during	  construction	  with	  minimal	  
             disruption	  except	  at	  the	  site	  of	  tunnel	  boring	  machine	  entrance	  and	  exit.	  
       • Traffic	  during	  construction	  would	  be	  minimally	  disrupted	  
       • Tunnels	  in	  stations	  are	  expensive,	  but	  this	  option	  would	  not	  impact	  stations	  
       • Tunnels	  are	  faster	  to	  build.	  Construction	  time	  is	  dramatically	  reduced	  because	  the	  work	  
             window	  issues	  and	  the	  phasing	  required	  on	  the	  road	  side	  are	  much	  less.	  	  
       • It	  would	  go	  under	  the	  utilities,	  reducing	  the	  cost.	  	  
       • It	  could	  go	  under	  the	  creeks.	  	  
       • It	  does	  not	  impact	  the	  streets.	  	  
       • The	  equivalent	  of	  shoofly	  tracks	  are	  needed	  near	  the	  portal,	  but	  not	  along	  the	  entire

Summary:	  	  
	  
Preliminary	  design	  of	  grade	  separations	  are	  vague	  and	  costs	  climb	  when	  one	  considers	  the	  
issues	  of	  staging,	  prolonged	  construction,	  utility	  relocation,	  ground	  water	  issues,	  and	  
maintaining	  operations	  on	  a	  heavily	  trafficked	  railway	  during	  construction.	  What	  initially	  seems	  
like	  a	  cheaper	  solution,	  can	  become	  expensive	  quickly	  when	  these	  costs	  are	  all	  tallied	  up.	  For	  
this	  reason,	  we	  support	  the	  inclusion	  of	  a	  short	  electric	  train	  only	  tunnel	  with	  freight	  on	  the

Dear City Council members,

I am a volunteer with moms demand action for gun sense, an organization started by an In Indiana mom,
Shannon Watts, after the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy.

Over the last 6 years, our organization has been active nationwide, with a chapter in all 50 states, working for
common sense gun laws.

Every year, in December, our organization has held inter faith vigils, in hundreds of communities nationwide, to
honor victims of gun violence and to bring awareness of this issue.

We are holding a vigil this Sunday, Dec 16th, 4.30 pm to 6 p.m at Lytton plaza in Palo Alto.

We cordially invite you to attend the vigil. If you are able to attend, please let me know and we will mention
your name in the speeches on Sunday.

Thank you for all your hard work for the city of Palo Alto. Thank you for your public service.

Your Sincerely,

POOJA MATHUR
(Resident of Palo Alto)

Subject:              Just a rant about palo alto police and city


Lt. Maloney,

As i said it looks like the police put those green stickers on windshields as I saw a police car leaving the scene right after
it was put on. Of course it may not have been you guys as I didn't actually see who stuck it on my rv. I peeled it off.

I asked for a little more time, a week but heard nothing from you and I was given a tow notice.

Oh well, so it goes in this world of ours.

But I'll complain with death not to far away. About            if I'm average. I'm now one of the poor with no power.

I've lived in palo alto over 40 years paying the high rental prices here for over 30 years of that time while I had a high
tech job. Then after my wife died in           and I lost my job, I moved onto the street in 2010. There's very little low
income housing here despite what the local politicians may say.
I'll be in January. Stanford wants to do                     surgery on my         as it's in very bad shape. I've been turning
them down because it's almost impossible to recover from that surgery while living on the street. I'm also being treated
for                       at stanford. If I'm average I have          years to live before the            kills me. Maybe I'll be
lucky and medical science will discover a cure in the next             and maybe not.

The police are employed and controlled by the rich power elite of the city. I understand you guys must obey them. But
they have no compassion for the poor ill old who are just trying to survive as best they can in a city who cares nothing
about us really. The city has no compassion.

I wish you guys had more backbone and stood up to them when they're wrong. But you know what they said about
wishes.

I also wish you guys stopped real crime rather than harassing the poor old sick like me who are just trying to hang onto
life and improve themselves. I work about 6 hours Monday through Friday at a minimum wage job trying to rebuild.

As for the rv with the blown engine I'm working as fast as I can to get rid of it. I've found it costs to much to buy and
replace the engine, so now I working as fast as I can to get rid of it. If the city gets rid of it, it will cost me a few thousand
I don't have. The city has towed a Ford I had that I hadn't the money to fix. The cost of towing charges that bill's towing
charges you, the daily storage fees, mount up very fast.

Subject:              Middlefield North traffic project review delayed again


City Managers, Council members:

I note that the review by Council of the Middlefield North traffic project has been pulled from the December 17 Council
agenda ‐ the second time this topic has been delayed.

It is an understatement to say that residents find it puzzling and concerning that the city does not want to move forward
with a traffic project that is a success from all the measurements and analysis performed. While many other traffic
projects suffer from long delays and/or negative reactions, Middlefield North should be a model for a successful
partnership between the City and residents.

This projected completed its one year trial in June and a report was completed by the City's consultant in August that
showed a dramatic decrease in accidents, lower speeds and high resident satisfaction with the changes.

I can confirm that I and my neighbors feel safer driving on Middlefield as well as walking on our sidewalks and crossing
at the new crosswalks.

However, the temporary barriers put in pace in June 2017 are deteriorating and could be made even more effective with
permanent replacements.

If this is matter of a successful projects being bumped off the Council calendar because they cannot manage their work
load, then we need the Council to meet more than one night per week. This increase in Council frequency would also
address the significant problem of starting resident input on controversial issues late in the evening, reducing resident
participation in local government.

Yes, Palo Alto is dealing with difficult and complex issues. But a clear success like the Middlefield North traffic project
should not be delayed because the City cannot manage its agenda.

Please put this project back on the calendar for 2018.

John Guislin

   Tues. Dec. 11, 2018

        Mr. Doug Vagim

     Doug‐ Thanks. I watched 15 min. of it last night. About all I could take with the noises in there. I am a layman wrt
computers, so it is hard to appreciate what is being shown. I'll read the article. I read a lot of the comments, and the
computer people are all blown away by this being shown in 1968.

                                                            1
      Apparently he was using a mouse, teleconferencing, I guess with microwave links, but not satellite links, some sort
of indexing and categorizing by the computer, it was all done on a mainframe in real time, pretty impressive right there,
it was all projected on a big screen in the hall. It seems amazing that the experts are all so amazed. We surely had
computers galore in 1968. Remember using the "IBM form" to take exams in college? You'd buy your IBM form at the
bookstore and bring it with you to the exam. It was all mainframes in 1968. That was what made the home computer so
stunning. Most people in the 70s thought they would always BE mainframes, not something you'd have in your home, or
on your desk at work. IBM broke upon the scene in ~1978 with its PC ads featuring Charlie Chaplin. Around then Apple
did that too. And then Bill Gates and his pals saw that the small computers would need programs. He said he saw an
article in Popular Science while at Harvard and he knew instantly to quit Harvard and get into writing software.

     I recall him saying that, after he dropped out of Harvard, he and is pals lived in an apartment in Albuquerque and
wrote code. They went to a lot of "action movies" he said. Probably lived on Coca Cola and pizza, I think he said.

      I recall Steve Jobs saying he went to the IBM research center in Palo Alto known as PARC‐ Palo Alto Research
Center‐ I think on Page Mill Road‐ late 60s or early 70s‐ and saw the graphical user interface‐ the GUI‐ demo'd. He said
"I knew right away that that was how it would be done".

      You do wonder, if it was all mainframes in 1968, how the Apollo astronauts had those computers in their LEMs as
they went down to the moon in 1969,1970, 1971 and 1972, the ones that kept getting overloaded and giving false
alarms, which were over‐ruled from the ground. "501 and 502 alarms again" and "we're go on those alarms" would
come up from the ground. You hear that in the Apollo 11 landing anyway.

       I had finished my MBA at Oregon by June, 1968 and was working on other things. Stanford had been big in
electronics and EE since the 30s, graduating Hewlett and Packard then. Computer Science came much later, but they
were surely teaching computer science at Stanford when I graduated in 1964. I just didn't study it. I'll bet they had a
pretty small enrollment at that point. Most people had no idea then that small personal computers were 14 years in the
future, and that software for them would be a huge business, so they studied Chem, Bio, EE, Physics, all of the
engineering programs, Civil, Chemical, etc., and the liberal arts. And no idea of the internet. It was the internet that
stimulated the huge sales of PCs and Macs. Even in the 80's I think PCs and Macs were bought by businesses and the
rare individual geek.

     One night on Charlie Rose, Andy Grove, the head of Intel for 20+ plus years, said "I completely missed the coming of
the internet". Bill Gates said the same thing. Imagine, those two guys, of all people, did not see the importance of the
internet until it was really available.

      Here is a 3 hour management course written, in 1990, by Grove, apparently:

         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgvZBVbdsWY

       Stanford Research Institute became a lightning rod for protests during Viet Nam, naturally, since they did a lot of
work for DOD. I think they even changed their name to SRI International as a result.

    And now you have the power of a 60's mainframe in an I‐phone. First the transistor and then the microprocessor
made the huge miniaturization of the computer possible. That was driven in part to reduce the weight of satellites.
Imagine if an I‐phone needed vacuum tubes. You'd need an extra room on your house for the mainframe for your
phone.

        Speaking of phones‐ my landline gave trouble three weeks ago. Static, followed by a faint dial tone. First my DSL
gave a lot of trouble. I changed the filters on the walls. That helped. I was getting a lot of red lights on the modem for
broadband, and a lot of the red light for service. The DSL got back to normal, but then the phone gave trouble. I was able

                                                             2
to make calls if I waited for 20 seconds for a dial tone to come on over the static. I called ATT last Tues. and they tested
the line and said the line was OK. They gave me a "ticket number" Finally, last Tues., the dial tone was gone. At that
point I went to the ATT store on Blackstone. They said they could not test my phone since they use VOIP and told me to
buy a new phone, I did, at Best Buy, and it didn't work either. I went back on Thurs. and they talked to the tech people
out of earshot and then arranged to send a tech out to the house yesterday.

       He determined at the ATT box on my garage that there was no dial tone on their system. Problem was beyond
my house. He went down the street and pulled a big cable out of a box and ran tests on it. It was OK so he concluded the
problem was north on Valentine up by Bullard. He left and went there. He returned in 30 min. and said he found there
that water was shorting a part in a box there, and he dried it off good. He tested at my box again and said I should be
good. Yes, nice dial tone in my house, and broadband back on. Problem solved. So I was without a phone for 5 days. He
was somewhat perplexed that I had perfect broadband service for most of time after the phone started giving trouble,
including after I lost the dial tone. He said they are separate.

      He told me how to test the system. Open the box outside, unplug a plug at lower right, plug my phone into that, and
if I get a dial tone, the problem is inside my house. Not getting one there, he knew the problem was with their
system. Unrelated, he said DSL is on the way out. We'll have box on a pole in our neighborhood, and an antenna at the
house. That will be our broadband internet. This guy was brilliant, and talked in jargon. I told him that a man at Stanford
invented DSL, how to send high speed internet down "a twisted wire pair". He said yes, and they have to be twisted to
work. five twists per foot and now six per foot. In 2000 in Santa Clara I had broadband, but it came in through the cable
TV port.

     Interesting vid. you sent. They have come a long way since 1968. Breathtaking, really. Nova should do a whole show
on that progress. Start with the vid you sent, tell what exactly is being shown, show where computer science was in
1964‐68, then progress from there to the PC in 1978, the development of the microprocessor, the software business,
the arrival of the internet around 1990, the development of cell‐phones, the I‐phone and Android, and where things
may go in the next 10 years. Self driving cars are about to break upon the world, and I think Nvidia will be a huge player.
At ~$150 per share, I think it is cheap. That's because I paid $242 for mine and have watched the vids by Jensen Huang.

        Huang said that Nvidia is not a chip company. They make the chips, the algorithms, the software stack. They are
doing millions of simulations of mishaps on the road before they ship in two years. If a vehicle anywhere in the world
has a mishap, that will be uploaded into the cloud and downloaded to every self‐driving vehicle in the world. He says
that self driving cars will save a lot of lives. We kill ~30,000 people per year on the road in the U.S.

Subject:              Paid Parental Leave Policy Support


To Whom It May Concern:

I would like to voice my support for the paid parental leave policy going to council today. I am fortunate to have parental leave
support that matches the proposed policy which would provide:

Employees up to six weeks of fully paid and benefited time off. Employees can use the six weeks anytime in the twelve months
following the birth, adoption or placement of a foster child in their home. Employees will continue to accrue their benefits as well
for the period of time they are on Paid Parental Leave as if on active work status. This six weeks can also be combined with
banked employee vacation and sick leave time to provide a more extended paid parental leave for employees.

I not only found it necessary to foster a loving child, but also return as a functional and productive employee. Most
daycares will not accept children less than 8 weeks old. At this time it is extremely difficult to care for an infant, oneself,
and work regular hours. My employer strives to take care of its employees and in return our company has many
dedicated professionals who appreciate that they can do the work they enjoy with the flexibility needed to raise their
families. I hope the council can see the merit in this and approve the policy proposed.

Sincerely,

Rica Enriquez

Subject:           Parking for Wilton Court



Dear Members of the City Council,

I write regarding the recent recommendation by City agencies to approve the 100% affordable housing
development known as Wilton Court.

While I am delighted that Wilton Court will consist of 100% "affordable" housing (I wish I knew what anyone
means by this), I am dismayed at the discriminatory behavior that is exhibited by the requirement that only
.69 parking spaces per unit be provided to residents of the project.

I can understand that one might believe that units reserved for the disabled might require less
parking. However, there are many forms of disability, and many disabled individuals can drive. Further, if
they cannot drive, they will have visitors and perhaps caretakers who do.

Further, everything we know about lower income workers today ‐‐ not in the future ‐‐ suggests that they need
their cars more than affluent young tech workers many of whom have transportation provided by their
employers either in the form of shuttles or transit passes or even Uber subscriptions. Young tech workers
generally go to and from one office.

The lower income worker on the other hand most likely has a working spouse. They may have more that one
job that requires them to move quickly from one location to the other ‐‐ neither served by Cal Train. Using
public transportation such as buses means long hours commuting and may not even be feasible. Getting to
several jobs, picking up kids from day care, getting to the store for food and doing other errands in their short
time off from work at this point in our City's development of transit options, requires a car.

Yet by not providing them with adequate parking, you are essentially saying only the wealthy deserve to have
cars and a place to park them. You are also telling the neighboring communities that they must deal with even
more on‐street parking in already overcrowded narrow streets.

I hope you will require that this meager parking space requirement be revisited.

Subject:             Please Support Castilleja


Dear Mayor Kniss and Members of the Palo Alto City Council,

My name is Wei Si and I live in Palo Alto, CA. I am writing to you as a parent and supporter of Castilleja School.

Castilleja was founded 110 years ago to equalize educational opportunities for women. Today, Castilleja seeks to close
the female leadership gap by gradually adding students over four years. Making this opportunity available for more
young women is central to furthering that mission.

As a Palo Alto resident, I am proud to have Castilleja in our city. The school has been an indispensable community
partner and is committed to maintaining its neighbors’ current quality of life. Castilleja has already implemented robust
Traffic Demand Management initiatives, and has repeatedly pledged to neighbors not only to do more, but that the
admittance of new students will be dependent on the continued success of the school’s traffic programs.

Now more than ever, at a time when national politics has devolved into shouting matches and one‐upmanship,
Castilleja’s mission of serving girls and young women from Palo Alto and other nearby cities is critically important.

Please do not let the loudest voices in the conversation obscure the robust support for Castilleja found throughout our
wonderful city.

Sincerely,

Wei Si

Subject:           please take action



Dear City Council members,

Recent developments regarding cell towers in residential neighborhoods and the actions of city staff
are alarming and I urge you to stand up for Palo Alto residents!

I am writing to ask you:

       1. To reverse your May 21st decision allowing Verizon to install its cheap and potentially
           hazardous equipment aboveground next to people’s homes; [what about fire hazards?]

       2. To direct City Staff to vigorously enforce Palo Alto’s aesthetics, noise and other ordinances
           with respect to the siting and installation of cell towers near residences; and, more
           specifically,

       3. To direct City Staff to stop advising the Planning and Transportation Commission to
           incorporate the FCC’s aggressively pro-telecommunications-industry October order into our
           municipal ordinances. [How for example is $270/year rent in the best interest of Palo Alto
           residents?]

Dozens of other cities are standing up for their neighborhoods on this issue. Palo Alto can and should
be a leader in creating a community that is respectful of residents’ needs and concerns.

Sincerely,
Tina Chow, Ph.D.

So the city of Palo Alto pretends to want to do something to help with the problem of not enough affordable housing
.......Why then is the city council approving the ousting of tenants from the President Hotel so we can allow for rich
investors to create yet another high end hotel ? And one that will not be able to provide parking that is adequate.
This is outrageous !
Why can't we work with the owners in a way similar to what was done with Buena Vista Park !? Or does the city really
care about those being displaced?
I am sorry that I cannot attend the city council meeting tonight so that I might be better able to understand what is
happening.
Thankfully I saw this post on Next Door Palo Alto. I hope I am interpreting the post correctly.

Subject:           Proposed Art for the new Public Safety Building



Dear Elise DeMarzo, Peter Wegner (please forward a copy to Peter), City Council, and City Manager:

Thank you for sharing the initial art designs for the new parking structure and Public Safety Building planned
for Sherman Avenue in the Cal Ave neighborhood. I enjoyed hearing about your creative process, Peter. Your
research and thought processes are impressive and inspiring.

The PSB will be in my backyard as I live in Mayfield and ride my bike on Sherman and Park every day. Also, I
am an artist myself ‐‐ I have a BFA and a Master of Arts. I very much enjoy the public art in Palo Alto and I look
forward to new treasures in the future.

You asked for feedback last week at the community meeting focused on the four art pieces Peter is designing
for the PSB and the new parking garage. Hence I write with reservations concerning your concept for the
outside wall of the parking structure (I think this is where you plan to place it). The three‐dimensional
sculpture composed of LED lights gives me pause. As an environmentalist, I believe it is a mistake to create art
that requires power consumption 24 hours a day, and I'm concerned about the costs of ongoing maintenance
such an artwork would require. Such a sculpture would be expensive to run and maintain, and it would
needlessly draw on the City's resources. I also feel the massive three‐dimensionality of the piece is
unattractive. While the lighting would add interest, it also suggests that the City has energy to burn and that is
a turnoff.

I would much rather see something in metal or glass or perhaps a wall of succulents ‐‐ something that doesn't
require ongoing energy consumption and expensive maintenance. I think of Anish Kapoor's spectacular
stainless steel sculpture in Chicago's Millennium Park titled Cloud Gate, or the famous metal bull sculpture
that until recently was in front of Merrill Lynch in New York City, or the stunning outdoor wall of succulents at
SFMOMA. Some greenery would look wonderful on that wall. It would add color, texture and would plants
help fight climate change.

I hope that everyone involved in choosing Public Art for Palo Alto will factor in an analysis of the
environmental impacts. We should be conserving energy AND reducing plastics, etc. The proposed indoor
piece in the PSB lobby was described as being composed of slices of plastic. Could that same concept be
constructed from wood? I imagine it would be equally if not more beautiful if made from wood.

Everything we do in our City must take into account climate change ‐‐ everything right down to the art we
choose. Thank you for considering these points.

Sincerely,

Shannon Rose McEntee

       Apparently Congress will have to pass legislation that nullifies the "Citizens United" Supreme Court decision,
 thereby enabling the States to pass campaign finance laws requiring transparency wrt who finances candidates. Such
 legislation probably cannot pass with Trump as President. It's just possible that he is a beneficiary of the current

Subject:          Re: Step back on the housing ordinance giveaways to deveoplers



Dear Mayor Kniss and Council Members,
     I was one of the attendees of last Monday’s council meeting, where the residents spoke
mainly opposing the changing of the ground rules for development in the downtown area as well
as PA in general. The argument that was put forward by Councilman Walbach that it’s time to
pass the said ordinance, because we have spent so much time deciding on the details as part of
the comprehensive plan. This is a poor and lame argument. Since 2017, there have been many
changes in the quality of life issues, such as overall crowding due to too many people in town
without adequate housing and parking, it does make sense to take a step back on approving the
city code in favor of the developers for doing away with parking requirements, building “open ‘
spaces on the rooftop of conversions and developments in the downtown area. Just handing out
out giveaways for market rate housing is not the way, please!
  As my friend Rebecca Sanders remarked, for whose benefit is the city government set up and
whose interests are they serving, when we see special deals being parceled to builders and
developers, so their financial interests are taken care of, while the residents have to live with the
consequences of the resulting crowding. Unsurprisingly, developers are interested in
maximizing their benefits, but it is your job to look for the overall benefits to the
residents. Please ask yourself this question “ Is the city council doing its job ? “. I for one can say
that some individual council members are paying attention to the welfare of the residents but
unfortunately not enough. Once a council member’s tenure finishes, their time on the council
may come to an end but, the consequences of their decisions have a huge impact on the life of
the residents for a long time. At this critical juncture, please don’t drop the ball and make
decisions, whose consequences cannot be undone! Erring on the side of caution is better than
giving away exceptions to the developers and burdening us residents. The project on the VTA lot is
a good one to watch. You have approved the experiment, and now we should wait and see how
things work out with the reduced parking idea. The wait is definitely worth it.
  There should be no exceptions as far as development in the downtown area is concerned. There
are city ordinances are there for a reason. Hoping that BMR housing will be the result, will not
happen just by wishing. Please tell the developers that they are not going to get exceptions and
see what happens. Handing the keys to the town is not an option, you just cannot foist the
burdens on us, the residents.
 Thank you for listening,

To The Honorable City of Palo Alto City Council:

I urge you NOT to rush through a change to law. No change whatsoever to the current Downtown
Grandfathered Facilities Law of 2016 should be made until there is a FULL vetting and FULL review by the
Planning and Transportation Committee.

There is simply NO urgency to overriding current law, particularly at the eleventh hour.

It is unacceptable to the citizens of Palo Alto.

Also, please note that this long time Palo Alto resident urges the Council , when the issue is again
considered in 2019, to make NO changes that would prevent, in any manner, residential uses to convert to
commercial ones.

Palo Alto MUST preserve the housing it now has!!

We must preserve affordable downtown housing and protect tenants from being displaced.

Palo Alto City Clerk

Palo Alto, CA 94301

       RE: Request for City Action Against CTO Jonathan Reichental


Dear Ms. Stump and Ms. Minor:



This letter serves to formally notify the City Attorney and City Clerk that CTO Jonathan Reichental has

violated the “gift” and conflict of interest provisions of state law in connection with several trips which

he has taken which were paid for by 501(c)(6) nonprofit organizations and the telecommunications

industry, and through his participation in the “Connected Cities” working group and other official City

actions. These violations are outlined in the enclosed complaint letters which I recently filed with the

California Fair Political Practices Commission.



In connection with your authority under state law (California Government Code sections 91000 et seq.)

as the “civil prosecutor” and “filing officer,” respectively, I respectfully request that you immediately
                                                          1
investigate these violations, immediately require Mr. Reichental to amend his Form 700s to include the

missing sources of income, missing trips, and incomplete information about the trips, ask him to refrain

from participating in any further City matters affecting the telecommunications industry, and take any

other steps and levy any and all fines justified by the law.



Though I assume that you have seen them, I also want to make certain that the record shows that the

City has received the recent San Jose Mercury News, Palo Alto Daily Post and Palo Alto Weekly

articles about Mr. Reichental’s violation of these laws. (Copies attached.) These articles demonstrate

that the public clearly is interested in whether Mr. Reichental has violated the law, and will hopefully

prompt both the FPPC and the City to open an immediate investigation and take enforcement action

against Mr. Reichental as soon as possible. In addition, Mr. Reichental effectively admits in the

November 16, 2018 Daily Post article that his Form 700s are riddled with errors and omissions.



I understand that Mr. Reichental is required to file a Leaving Office Form 700 within thirty days after

leaving his job here, hence it will be due in mid-January. I respectfully request that Mr. Reichental

amend all of the Form 700s he has filed during his tenure in Palo Alto by that date, amend them so that

they are accurate, complete and unambiguous.



Feel free to contact me if you need any additional information regarding the complaint letters or Mr.

Reichental’s activities on behalf of the telecommunications companies, and thank you for your prompt

attention to this matter.



Sincerely,


                                                     2

Sworn Complaint to the Fair Political Practices Commission reporting
   Jonathan Reichental, the Chief Technology Officer and Chief
           Information Officer of Palo Alto, California



Part One: Overview

Jonathan Reichental is both the Chief Technology Officer and the Chief Information
Officer for the City of Palo Alto. Between 2013 and 2017, Dr. Reichental took at least
28 trips that were paid for by outside-the-City enterprises. Twenty-five of those trips
were international.

There is substantial evidence that Dr. Reichental, in repeatedly accepting expensive
gifts of travel from others, has been systematically violating California gift law. The
second section of this complaint documents these violations.

There is also substantial evidence that Dr. Reichental has used his official position as
Palo Alto’s Chief Technical Officer/Chief Information Officer to influence City matters
affecting the companies that underwrote his travels. The third section of this complaint
addresses this issue.

At its core, the complaint boils down to this: During his tenure as a senior city official,
Jonathan Reichental has been repeatedly flown around the world by the
telecommunications industry. In the Statements of Economic Interests/Form 700s he
has filed reporting this travel, he has repeatedly mischaracterized the parties paying for
his trips as 501(c)(3) nonprofits, although they clearly are not. In addition, he has taken
a substantial number of trips that he has failed to report. Plus, he has failed to report
income from his considerable employment outside the City. And finally, Dr. Reichental
has repaid his patrons for their generosity by being the steadfast ally of the
telecommunications companies that have dealings with the City of Palo Alto.

Substantiation for these allegations can be found in the attachments to this complaint,
most of which are documents obtained through the California Public Records Act.
Some of Dr. Reichental’s misconduct is hiding in plain sight on the Statements of
Economic Interests/Form 700s he filed. Other misconduct can be seen only by
comparing one document to another. The text which follows is intended to provide a
roadmap through the attachments, highlighting the elements that point to violations of
the law.

Part Two: Gift Law Violations

There is substantial evidence that Jonathan Reichental has been systematically
violating California gift law while working for the City of Palo Alto.

For example, in 2016, TMForum—a telecommunications industry trade association—
paid for Dr. Reichental to take two trips overseas, one to China and one to the French
Riviera. For each trip, TMForum paid for Dr. Reichental’s roundtrip business class
airfare, hotel expenses, meals, ground transportation and visa expenses.

Attached is Dr. Reichental’s 2016 Statement of Economic Interests/Form 700 on which
he reports these two trips, along with seven others (Exhibit A). Attached as well is
correspondence between TMForum and Dr. Reichental that lays out the substantial
expenses TMForum paid for on Dr. Reichental’s China trip (to be found on Exhibit B
Page 1 and Exhibit B Page 2). (NOTE: TMForum paid for the same expenses when
they sent him to France.)

A governmental ethics attorney, Jim Sutton of San Francisco, has analyzed at my
request one of those TMForum-funded trips, the trip to China. Here is his analysis:

       valued at $5,000 from “TM Forum,” a telecommunications industry trade
       association, on his 2016 Statement of Economic Interests/Form 700 (among
       other gifts and sources of income). The Form 700 indicates that Mr. Reichental
       made a speech in connection with this travel, that the event lasted for five days,
       that it took place in China, and that the TM Forum is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
       However, TM Forum’s most recent federal tax return (IRS Form 990) indicates
       that it is actually a 501(c)(6) nonprofit corporation. This trip seems to violate the
       $470 gift limit because: (1) even though Mr. Reichental may have made a
       speech at the event in China, the exception for making a speech explicitly only
       applies to travel within the United States and only applies to up to three days of
       travel; (2) the TM Forum is not a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.”

These same two points are applicable to Dr. Reichental’s 2016 trip to France, which
was also paid for by TMForum (i.e., it involved international travel, and it was paid for by
an organization that is not a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit).

More generally, Dr. Reichental appears to have repeatedly misrepresented trade
associations as 501(c)(3) nonprofits in order to evade the constraints imposed by
California gift law. For example, Platform for Innovation—a German entity which in
2016 paid for one five-day and one four-day trip to Vienna for Dr. Reichental—appears
to be an industry trade association like TMForum. Yet Dr. Reichental reported it to be a

                                              3
501(c)(3) nonprofit. Similarly, the Global Risk Institute, which paid for Dr. Reichental’s
trip to Canada in 2016, does not appear to be a charity or educational institution and
thus does not qualify as 501(c)(3) non-profit. Yet Dr. Reichental reported it to be one.

Dr. Reichental’s mischaracterizations of his trip to China, his trip to France, his two trips
to Vienna and his trip to Canada are documented in Exhibit A (Dr. Reichental’s
Statement of Economic Interests/Form 700 for 2016).

Then there is Management Forum der Verlagsgruppe Handelsblatt GmbH, which paid
for a four-day trip to Germany for Dr. Reichental in 2016 (again see Exhibit A). Dr.
Reichental says their payment of his travel expenses was a “gift.” Yet Management
Forum appears to be a for-profit German enterprise, part of Handelsblatt Media Group.
Moreover, Dr. Reichental said he “provided training” for Management Forum in
Frankfort—i.e., he did not make a speech or appear on a panel. As I understand
California Gift Law, this trip also would appear to violate the $470 gift limit.

Please note as well that:

   1. All of the travel payments Dr. Reichental reports on his 2016 Form 700—and
      indeed all of the travel payments he reports on all of his 2012-2017 Form 700s—
      are round numbers. When do expenses ever sum to round numbers?

   2. The numbers he reports often seem remarkably low. For example, how could Dr.
      Reichental’s roundtrip business class airfare, hotel expenses, meals, ground
      transportation and visa expenses on his five-day trip to China in 2016 have
      amounted to only $5,000, when a business class roundtrip plane ticket there
      alone costs almost that much? (The numbers Dr. Reichental reports often look
      more like fees than travel expenses.)

Attached you will find the other Statements of Economic Interest/Form 700s Dr.
Reichental filed between the first full year of his employment (2012), and February,
2018, the date of his most recent filing. They are labeled Exhibits C through G.

The specific items in each year’s filing that I believe merit your attention are listed
below. In particular, you will find highlighted:

       -   Discrepancies between Dr. Reichental’s Statements of Economic Interest and
           the Outside Employment Statements he filed. (His Outside Employment
           Statements are labeled Exhibits H through L.) Please note that, in
           highlighting these discrepancies, the dates I’ve used refer to the dates on
           which the Outside Employment Statements were submitted by Dr. Reichental,


                                              4
          not the dates they were approved or the dates the City’s Human Resources
          Department received them.

      -   For each of the years 2012 through 2015, discrepancies between Dr.
          Reichental’s Statements of Economic Interest and the list of “appearances”
          he reported making on his personal website (www.reichental.com). Dr.
          Reichental has now removed the entire list of his appearances from his
          website. But I printed it out before he did, and you will find a copy of the list
          attached, labeled Exhibit M Page 1 through Exhibit M Page 3.

      -   Discrepancies between Dr. Reichental’s Statements of Economic Interest and
          his correspondence obtained under a California Public Records Request Act
          request (Exhibit N).

Here are the specific discrepancies on each Form 700:

   1. Form 700 filing dated March 7, 2013, for the year 2012 (Exhibit C):

      a. In this filing, Dr. Reichental failed to report at least one trip he took in 2012, a
         trip paid for by the high-tech trade association TechAmerica and by
         technology media company eRepublic’s Center for Digital Government. In
         Exhibit N Page 1 through Exhibit N Page 3, you will find emails which indicate
         that Dr. Reichental attended the Center for Digital Government/TechAmerica
         “Beyond the Beltway” Conference at the Ritz Carlton in Falls Church, Virginia,
         in March of 2012. As this correspondence shows, the organizers paid for Dr.
         Reichental’s air travel, hotel room, meals and ground transportation. Yet Dr.
         Reichental’s Form 700, which he filed in 2013 for January 1, 2012-December
         31, 2012, does not report this trip.

      b. Please note that this trip to the “Beyond the Beltway” Conference, though
         missing from Dr. Reichental’s Form 700, is included on the list of
         appearances he posted on his personal website (Exhibit M Page 3).

     c. The list of his travels Dr. Reichental posted on his personal website (again see
        Exhibit M Page 3) also reveals that he failed to report on his Form 700 filing
        three other out-of-the-Bay Area trips—two of them international—made in
        2012: 1) in February, to New York City; 2) in September, to Paris, France;
        and 3) in October, to Dublin, Ireland. It would be instructive to learn who paid
        for these trips he chose not to report, instructive to learn whether Dr.
        Reichental was paid a fee, and instructive to learn the businesses/industries
        behind the conferences’ organizers.


                                             5
2. Form 700 filing dated January 31, 2014, for the year 2013 (Exhibit D):

   a. In this Form 700, Dr. Reichental failed to report two out-of-the-area trips he
      made in 2013: 1) in September, to Indiana, presumably (Dr. Reichental
      describes his “appearance” as “Purdue University guest lectures”); and 2) in
      December, to San Diego. Each trip is included, however, on the list of
      appearances on his personal website (please see Exhibit M Page 2 and
      Exhibit M Page 3).

   b. Dr. Reichental also failed to report in this filing the income he received for
      employment at the University of San Francisco, employment that he says on
      his April 29, 2013, City of Palo Alto Outside Employment Statement (Exhibit
      H) was to begin on June 1, 2013, and would continue “indefinitely.”

   c. In this filing, Dr. Reichental reports that the Consulate General of France paid
      for him to spend a week in France in exchange for what he calls “consulate
      services on behalf of the French.” What does that mean? Probably not
      much. It appears this trip was in fact organized by and underwritten by the
      telecommunications industry and that it was a junket on which the industry
      sent Dr. Reichental and officials from other cities around the country (e.g., the
      Chief Technical Officer/Chief Information Officer of Philadelphia). I have
      correspondence obtained under the CPRA that discusses this trip, and I can
      send it to you, if you wish.


3. Form 700 filing dated February 19, 2015, for the year 2014 (Exhibit E):

   a. Dr. Reichental failed to report in this filing five out-of-the-area trips—three of
      them international—that he took in 2014, trips that are listed on his personal
      website. They are: 1) in January, to Ireland; 2) in February, to Las Vegas; 3)
      in April, to Denver; 4) in June, to Berlin, Germany; and 5) in December, to the
      Netherlands (see Exhibit M Page 2).

   b. Dr. Reichental also failed to report in this filing the income he received for
      employment at the University of San Francisco, employment that he says on
      his April 29, 2013, City of Palo Alto Outside Employment Statement (Exhibit
      H) was to begin on June 1, 2013 and would continue “indefinitely.”

   c. Dr. Reichental also traveled to Canada, a trip which he reports on his Form
      700 was paid for by Techtriangle, an organization he characterizes as “Non-
      for-profit.” Techtriangle no longer exists. But it appears that in 2014, it was a

                                         6
      joint municipal/commercial technology development venture, not a 501(c)(3)
      nonprofit.

d. As noted in point (a) above, Dr. Reichental took trips in 2014 to Ireland, Berlin
   and the Netherlands that he did not report on his Form 700 but listed on his
   personal website (again see Exhibit M Page 2 for documentation of this
   unreported travel). From the terse explanations he provides for these trips—
   “Code for Ireland,” “Ideas Camp” and “University-based Regional Development,”
   respectively—it does not appear that a 501(c)(3) nonprofit or a government
   agency underwrote the travel expenses for any of them.


4. Form 700 filing dated March 7, 2016, for the year 2015 (Exhibit F):

   a. Dr. Reichental failed to report on this filing two out-of-the-area trips—one of
      them international—that, he took in 2015, trips that are listed on his personal
      website. They are: 1) in October, to Los Angeles (“Substance Conference”);
      and 2) in November, to Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Telecomm and Technology
      Conference). (The trips are documented in Exhibit M Page 1.) Unanswered
      are the questions: What type of entity paid for these trips—in particular, who
      paid for the Telecomm Conference trip? What did the trips cost? Did he
      receive a fee?

   b. Dr. Reichental also failed to report on this filing the income he received for
      employment at the University of San Francisco, employment that he says on
      his December 29, 2015, City of Palo Alto Outside Employment Statement
      (page 2 of Exhibit I) began in April, 2013, and would continue “indefinitely.”

   c. Dr. Reichental failed to report on this filing the income he received for
      employment at UC Berkeley, employment that he says on his July 14, 2015,
      Outside Employment Statement (Exhibit J) began in Fall, 2015.

   d. Dr. Reichental also failed to report the income he received from four trips he
      took to Dubai in the employment of Peer Review, a United Arab Emirates-
      based company that stages conventions. According to Dr. Reichental’s
      December 29, 2015, Outside Employment Statement (page 4 (not page 1) of
      Exhibit I), he began working for Peer Review in Dubai in October, 2015.
      Unanswered here is the critical question, who are Peer Review’s clients?
      There is good reason to believe they include telecommunications companies
      1) given the subjects of the conferences Peer Review stages (e.g., “smart
      cities”), and 2) given that Dr. Reichental regularly speaks about
      telecommunications issues—in particular, cell-tower-dense “smart cities.”

                                        7
   e. Dr. Reichental reports four paid-for-by-others international trips in his filing.
      But the organizations that paid for these trips appear to be neither 501(c)(3)
      nonprofits nor government agencies. According to Dr. Reichental, the trips
      were paid for by: 1) ScienceWorks, which paid for Dr. Reichental to visit the
      Netherlands and which Dr. Reichental characterizes as a “Non-for-profit
      science advocacy organization.” ScienceWorks, however, appears to be a
      trade association. 2) the Canadian Cloud Council, which paid for Dr.
      Reichental to visit Canada and which Dr. Reichental says is “now part of
      Canadian Government.” But the Canadian Cloud Council appears not to
      have been part of the Canadian government when it paid for his travel; 3)
      Electric Ireland, which paid for Dr. Reichental’s visit to Ireland and which Dr.
      Reichental describes as a “non-for-profit Utility.” Electric Ireland is not a
      501(c)(3) nonprofit and not a government agency. And 4) the IT Association
      of Canada, which paid for Dr. Reichental to visit Canada and which he
      describes as “a non-for-profit association of the IT industry in Canada.”
      However, the IT Association of Canada appears to be simply a trade
      organization, not a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

   f. Finally, please note that, in an addendum to Dr. Reichental’s Form 700 filing
      for 2015, he states that “All amounts are estimates based on typical airline
      and hotel costs.” Unexplained, however, is how he flew roundtrip to the
      Netherlands and spent three nights in a hotel there for $1,000, for example, or
      how he flew roundtrip to Ireland and spent five nights there for $1,000.
      Indeed, as noted above, these numbers look more like fees than travel
      expenses.


5. Form 700 filing dated February 2, 2017, for the year 2016 (Exhibit A):

   At the outset of this section of the complaint, note is taken of a number of entries
   in Dr. Reichental’s Form 700 filing for 2016—for example, two trips paid for by
   the telecommunications industry trade association TMForum. There are several
   additional aspects of this filing for 2016 that also merit attention, specifically:

   a. Dr. Reichental failed to report the income he received for employment at the
      University of San Francisco, employment that he says on his December 29,
      2015, City of Palo Alto Outside Employment Statement (page 2 of Exhibit I)
      began in April, 2013, and would continue “indefinitely.”

   b. Dr. Reichental also failed to report on this filing the income he received for
      employment at UC Berkeley, employment that he says on his July 14, 2015,

                                         8
      and December 29, 2015, Outside Employment Statements (Exhibit J and
      page 3 of Exhibit I) began in Fall/October, 2015.

   c. Dr. Reichental failed as well to report the income he received for four trips he
      took to Dubai in the employment of Peer Review, a United Arab Emirates-
      based company that stages conventions. According to Dr. Reichental’s
      November 30, 2015, Outside Employment Statement (page 1 of Exhibit I), he
      began a second year of working quarterly for Peer Review in Dubai on
      January 1, 2016.

   d. Dr. Reichental failed as well to report on this filing the income he received for
      employment by Lynda.com. Dr. Reichental’s February 5, 2018 Outside
      Employment Statement (page 3 of Exhibit K) says he began this work in April,
      2016.

   e. Beginning in 2016, Dr. Reichental stopped listing his “appearances” on his
      website, although he continued to list his appearances for previous years.
      However, the website says information about his 2016 appearances is
      available by request. Perhaps this is something you can request.


6. Form 700 filing dated February 11, 2018, filing for the year 2017 (Exhibit G):

   a. Dr. Reichental failed to report on this filing the income he received for
      employment by the Ignite Institute. But on his February 5, 2018, Outside
      Employment Statement (page 5 of Exhibit K), Dr. Reichental states that his
      employment began there in November, 2017.

   b. Dr. Reichental also failed to report on this filing the income he received for
      employment at UC Berkeley, employment that he says on his July 14, 2015,
      and December 29, 2015, Outside Employment Statements (Exhibit J and
      page 3 of Exhibit I) began in Fall/October, 2015, and would continue
      indefinitely.

   c. Dr. Reichental failed to report on this filing the income he received for
      employment at “the Camp” in Aix-en-Provence, France, employment that he
      says on his September 18, 2017, Outside Employment Statement (page 2 of
      Exhibit L) was to begin in October, 2017, and continue for an indefinite period.

   d. Dr. Reichental also failed to report on this filing the income he received for
      employment by O’Reilly Media (O’Reilly Media was Dr. Reichental’s employer
      before he was hired by the City of Palo Alto), employment that he says on his

                                         9
   January 5, 2018, Outside Employment Statement (page 4 of Exhibit K) he
   began in November 1, 2017. Who are O’Reilly Media’s corporate clients and
   sponsors? That’s a question worth asking.

e. Four more paid-for-by-others trips reported in this filing were paid for by
   entities that almost certainly are not 501(c)(3) nonprofits or government
   agencies. These are the trips paid for by: 1) Blockchain Association of
   Australia, which paid for Dr. Reichental’s week-long trip to Melbourne, and
   which appears to be a technology trade association; 2) the Rio de Janiero
   Chamber of Commerce, which paid for Dr. Reichental to spend five days in
   their city; 3) Star Alliance, which paid for Dr. Reichental to spend three days
   in Frankfurt, and which appears to be a for-profit private enterprise; and 4)
   NZTech, which paid for Dr. Reichental to spend a week in New Zealand, and
   which is almost certainly a technology trade association.

f. As noted above, beginning in 2016, Dr. Reichental stopped listing his
   “appearances” on his website, although he continued to list his appearances
   for previous years. But since the website promises that the list is available by
   request, perhaps you can request it for 2017.




                                     10
Part Three: Conflict of Interest Violations

It is my understanding 1) that city employees are prohibited from using their official
position to influence a city matter affecting an entity which has provided them with
income or other compensation, and 2) that they must disqualify themselves from any
city decisions which may affect their personal financial interests.

Yet Jonathan Reichental, the Chief Technical Officer and Chief Information Officer of
Palo Alto, who plays a critical—and hands on—role in the City’s dealings with the
telecommunications industry, has repeatedly accepted gifts of expensive international
travel from an industry that is central to his job.

In particular, he chairs Palo Alto’s so-called Connected Cities working group, which is
continually overseeing numerous telecommunications projects in the City. This multi-
department group of City staff meets regularly to, for example, review the status of the
applications of telecommunications companies wishing to install now 150-and-counting
cell towers in Palo Alto’s residential neighborhoods.

Both the Agendas and the Minutes of the meetings of Dr. Reichental’s Connected City
group—which have been obtained through California Public Records Act requests—
show his personal involvement in telecom-related matters before the City and his
personal efforts to smooth the path of the companies that provided funds for his travels.

For example, attached are the agendas for two Connected Cities meetings that
occurred within months of Dr. Reichental’s telecom-industry-paid trips to China (in
September, 2016) and France (in May, 2016)):

       a. Re the January 18, 2017, Reichental Staff Meeting agenda (Exhibit O Page 1
          and Exhibit O Page 2):

          Please note that, on the first page of the agenda (Exhibit O Page 1), Dr.
          Reichental (“Jonathan” as he is referred to) is listed as the “owner” of a
          number of agenda items specifically involving Verizon, including: “90 site
          DAS project entering ARB review.” The project being referred to here is the
          first 90 small cell node cell towers that Verizon and Vinculums have applied to
          install in Palo Alto (ARB refers to Palo Alto’s all-volunteer Architectural
          Review Board, which is charged with reviewing cell tower applications and
          recommending either approval or disapproval).

          Dr. Reichental is also listed as the “owner” of a number of agenda items
          specifically involving AT&T, including: “9/21 meeting--focused on AT&T not
          going through ARB, letter sent to [City] Council regarding approvals.” I will

                                              11
          have more to say about this item below. Meanwhile, please note that this and
          the prior item cited illustrate how up to his elbows Dr. Reichental is in matters
          concerning the industry that has underwritten his international travels.
          Indeed, numerous additional telecommunications agenda items are listed on
          pages 1 and 2 of Exhibit O.

      b. February 11, 2017 Reichental Staff Meeting Agenda (Exhibit P Page 1 and
         Exhibit P Page 2)

          Please note that Dr. Reichental is again listed as the “owner” of the
          Verizon/Vinculums cell tower applications and of several AT&T agenda items
          (on page 1), and that on page 2, under “Follow Up Item”, a more junior person
          has been assigned to: “Check with Mike N. on AT&T cabinets.” Again, the
          agenda for this February 11, 2017 meeting of Dr. Reichental’s Connected
          Cities group is filled with telecommunications projects, just as the agenda for
          the January 18, 2017 meeting was.

Regarding the AT&T cabinets referenced above: AT&T is one of two
telecommunications companies that I can document have asked Dr. Reichental to help
them in their dealings with the City of Palo Alto and that received his help.

Specifically, in Exhibit Q Page 1, Exhibit Q Page 2 and Exhibit Q Page 3, you’ll find a
record of AT&T’s External Affairs Manager, Angela Kung, asking Dr. Reichental in
March, 2016, to help AT&T bypass an Architectural Review Board (ARB) requirement
relating to equipment cabinets AT&T wants to install in Palo Alto.

I have not been able to determine the outcome of Dr. Reichental’s efforts on behalf of
Ms. Kung and AT&T, but clearly he did make an effort—an effort that included: 1) in his
words, “focus[ing] on AT&T not going through ARB” in his Connected Cities staff
meetings (this is documented in (a) and (b) above); and 2) contacting all of the relevant
senior staff in Palo Alto—including City Manager Jim Keene, then Director of Planning
Hillary Gitelman, and Director of the Utilities Department Ed Shikada—to convene a
meeting to “discuss how [AT&T] can move forward with their 2 cabinet permit request.”
The meeting took place on “9/21,” according to the Connected Cities agendas and
minutes (again, documented in Exhibit O Page 1). (Dr. Reichental’s email setting up
this meeting is in Exhibit R. The date was removed from the email before it was sent to
me.)

Unfortunately, these email threads can be difficult to follow, not least because some
emails are clearly missing. This is because the City of Palo Alto, in responding to my
California Public Records Act requests, said they were excluding draft emails, excluding
emails protected by attorney-client privilege (which they appear to define very broadly)

                                            12
and excluding emails that they deemed part of the deliberative process (which they also
apparently define very broadly). As a result, I have been able to obtain only a subset of
the relevant correspondence.

That said, please take note that Angela Kung’s employer, AT&T, is one of the
companies that funds TMForum, the trade organization that paid for Dr. Reichental’s
trips to China and the Riviera. Please note, as well, that AT&T’s relationship with Dr.
Reichental extends beyond underwriting his international travel. Both Ms. Kung and Dr.
Reichental are members of the Wireless Communications Initiative Committee, which is
part of Joint Venture Silicon Valley (JVSV), an organization whose funding comes in
part from AT&T, Verizon, Crown Castle and other telecommunications companies
(JVSV also receives support from corporations not in the telecom industry).

Ms. Kung is not the only telecommunications company employee sitting on the JVSV
Wireless Communication Initiative Committee with Dr. Reichental. Also sitting on the
committee are representatives of Verizon, Vinculums, Hammett & Edison and Crown
Castle—companies all of which are, like AT&T, in particular directly involved in
applications to install cell towers in Palo Alto.

Here is another example of the telecommunications industry asking Dr. Reichental to go
to bat for it in Palo Alto, and of Dr. Reichental complying: In this case, David Witkowski,
the Executive Director of the Wireless Communications Initiative of Joint Venture Silicon
Valley, asked Dr. Reichental to intercede on behalf of Crown Castle. (Crown Castle
installs cell towers, then leases them to telecommunications service providers. The
company has a number of applications pending in Palo Alto.)

On June 16, 2016, Mr. Witkowski wrote to Dr. Reichental: “One of our members (Crown
Castle) has reached out to me regarding telecom projects in the City of Palo Alto. …
One of the concerns expressed by Crown Castle was that groups within the City of Palo
Alto seemed to be operating independently, resulting in delays. … It was my hope that
through your leadership and position as CIO we could help pull those groups together
and set a less contentious foundation for future projects.” (You will find this
correspondence in Exhibit Q Page 4 and Exhibit Q Page 5.)

Again, these email threads are messy and incomplete, and I cannot tell you exactly
what Dr. Reichental ultimately delivered. But he certainly was intimately involved in
Crown Castle’s dealings with Palo Alto, dealings he never should have been involved in
given the expensive gifts of travel he accepted from the telecommunications industry.
Two examples of his involvement are: 1) the Crown Castle projects appear over and
over as items on the agendas for the multi-department “Connected City” staff meetings
Dr. Reichental chaired (see (a) and (b) above); and 2) he met with Mr. Witkowski i) for
30 minutes on July 18, 2016 (i.e., a few weeks after Mr. Witkowski made his request

                                            13
and two months after Dr. Reichental’s first international TMForum-paid-for trip), and
again ii) for 60 minutes on November 21, 2016 (i.e., a month after Dr. Reichental’s
second TMForum-paid-for trip). Documentation of these meetings can be found in
Exhibit S Page 1 (see the subject line of the email at the top of the page) and Exhibit S
Page 2 (again, see the subject line of the email at the top of the page).

While these are the only two meetings for which I have uncovered records, Dr.
Reichental most likely met with Mr. Witkowski on other occasions as well to discuss
telecommunications projects in Palo Alto. Dr. Reichental’s juniors on the Connected
Cities working group certainly did.

Please note that the mission of the JVSV Wireless Initiative Committee on which Dr.
Reichental sits—along with the employees of telecommunications companies such as
AT&T and Verizon—is to promote wireless connectivity. So, for example, while the
California League of Cities, which includes Palo Alto, was fighting the passage of
SB649—pro-telecom legislation that the industry lobbied heavily for last year—this
group was advocating for its passage. (The bill passed, but ultimately Governor Brown
vetoed it.)

Also: 1) This same Wireless Initiative Committee on which Dr. Reichental sits submitted
a brief in support of approving Verizon’s first cluster of neighborhood cell towers in Palo
Alto; 2) its Executive Director, Mr. Witkowski, spoke in favor of the towers at a May City
Council hearing convened to consider approving them; and 3) at the same meeting, City
employee Jim Fleming (no relation to me)—who is a member of the Connected Cities
staff group Dr. Reichental leads, and who in emails to others at City Hall has said he
often attends JVSV Wireless Initiative Committee meetings as Dr. Reichental’s proxy—
was the staff person assigned to answer Council’s questions about the proposed cell
tower installations.

In other words, not only does the telecommunications industry-funded Wireless Initiative
Committee on which Dr. Reichental sits aggressively push for more cell towers in the
City which employs him, it also succeeded in planting a ringer as the supposedly neutral
staff member City Council turned to for straight answers about cell installations.

Mr. Fleming was not the only supposedly neutral advisor at that meeting with strong ties
to the telecommunications industry-supported Joint Ventures Silicon Valley. Palo Alto
City Manager Jim Keene, who was also advising Council at the hearing on Verizon’s cell
tower applications, is on the Board of Directors of Joint Venture Silicon Valley.
Incidentally, Mr. Keene is the person to whom Dr. Reichental reports at City Hall.

Additional Documentation of Conflict of Interest


                                            14
Being a novice at filing a complaint, I am unsure as to which of the documents I
obtained would be of most interest to the Commission and which the Commission would
find most compelling. I am sure my sort has been far from perfect, and, going forward, I
would be glad to send you more material. In particular, I have and would be glad to
send you:

      1. Documentation that Palo Alto’s all-volunteer Architectural Review Board has
         complained that City Staff seemed to be helping Verizon thwart the ARB’s
         directive that ancillary cell tower equipment be located underground.

      2. Correspondence indicating that Jim Fleming (again, he is a member of the
         Connected Cities staff group Dr. Reichental leads, and he says he often
         attends JVSV Wireless Communications Initiative meetings at Dr.
         Reichental’s behest) responded to the Palo Alto Assistant Planning Director’s
         request for information about small cell node cell tower installations by
         sending him the completely pro-telecommunications industry handbook
         prepared by David Witkowski, the Executive Director of JVSV’s Wireless
         Communications Initiative committee.

      3. Documentation that Dr. Reichental is a member of another telecom industry
         group besides JVSV’s Wireless Communications Initiative Committee,
         namely, the Connected Cities Advisory Board of the telecommunications
         industry’s Wireless Broadband Alliance. According to the “About Us” page of
         the Alliance’s website, the group focuses “on four major programs: Carrier
         Wi-Fi Services, Next Generation Wireless & 5G, Internet of Things and
         Connected Cities.” The Chairman of the Wireless Broadband Alliance Board
         is JR Wilson, who is AT&T’s VP Tower Strategy and Roaming, and its
         membership includes “seven of the top 10 mobile operator groups.”

      4. Documentation that Dr. Reichental has been promoting the
         telecommunication industry’s “smart cities”/”connected cities” agenda at City
         Hall. For example, he produced at least two documentaries on the subject,
         apparently with residents’ money. Also, “Connected Cities” is the name he
         gave to his City Staff working group. (A so-called “smart city” or “connected
         city” is one in which wireless connectivity is maximized. In other words, these
         are by definition cities filled with cell towers. And cities filled with cell towers
         are exactly what Dr. Reichental’s patrons in the telecommunications industry
         want.)

      5. Documentation that Dr. Reichental has been promoting the
         telecommunications industry’s “smart cities”/”connected cities” agenda


                                            15
   outside of Palo Alto (this is what he does at most of his numerous speaking
   engagements).

6. Documentation that Dr. Reichental has opposed fiberoptics-to-the-premises
   (aka FTTP) projects, in favor of expanded wireless coverage (i.e., services
   Verizon and AT&T want to sell to residents here).

7. Additional documentation of Dr. Reichental’s repeated and on-going dealings
   with telecommunications companies as part of his job as Palo Alto’s Chief
   Technology Officer and Chief Information Officer. For example, Dr.
   Reichental’s IT Department is the master account (and lead department) for
   the City’s $300,000/year contract with Verizon for telecommunications
   services.

               ith the tate Fair Political Practice Com-

       he contends the travel was funded by the telecom-
    unications industry mainly through nonprofit trade
::: ups and is illegal under state laws that prohibit

     "'Dr. Reichental has been using his senior position
     City Hall to influence the city's dealings with the
·elecommunications industry," Fleming said. "This
      ludes shaping the city's response to the applica-
   ons telecom companies have made to install cell                  e in Carmel. Reviewing
  owers in Palo Alto's residential neighborhoods."                 nm~  Properties Group.
     Reichental told the Post on Nov. 16 that he consult-
ed with the FPPC before accepting the trips and that
   e met the state's criteria.
     "I use a lot of my free time for teaching, learning
and education," Reichental said. "The trips I took
 were generally in consultation with the FPPC advice
 phone line and met the reimbursement criteria of gov-
 ernment, educational or non-for-profit."
     He said he reported all the trips on the financial dis-
   losure document officials must file annually, called a
 Form 700.
     Reichental said he didn't participate in the deci-
   ionmaking regarding the Verizon antennas because
 his job involved the city's IT department, and the an-
   enna applications are handled by a different depart-
 ment.
      He added, "I don't believe any of my trips were
 paid for by commercial interests in technology and
   ommunications."
      But Fleming pointed out that one of his trips was
 from TMForum, a nonprofit partiall fun                  b.
  AT&T. And AT&T is seeking to install equipment in
  Palo Alto, Fleming said.

                Excited about next cUpter
     In his email to the Post on Wednesday, Reichental
 said he is excited about the next chapter in his career.
     "About a year ago I started speaking with City
 . fanager Jim Keene about my next career move. After
   ix years, it felt like the right time to begin exploring
    variety of career growth opportunities," Reichental
    Tote. "This past summer I told Jim that I would be
      ving before the end of the year.
      "After entertaining several compelling offers, a
  · w months ago I found exactly the right organization
      d role," he wrote. "I will be the Global Industry
      lutions Leader for Public Sector at Oracle.
      "I have enjoyed every moment of my time at the
     ty of Palo Alto. It has been a remarkable privilege
   · r me to serve this warm and engaged community,"
     eichental said in his email. "I also got to work with
          ing co-workers and a great IT team. Almost sev-
       years to the day I began my journey at the city, I
     ill start my new role at Oracle on Dec 17 ."
      Reichental was paid $243,360 last year. Including
         fits, his total compensation came to $321,660,

Complaint accuses Palo Alto's top tech
official of taking 28 junkets paid by firms
linked to city business
United Neighbors member files ethics complaint against
chief information officer over trips




Palo Alto Chieflnformation Officer Jonathan Reichental (Jason Green I Daily News)

Palo Alto's top technology official violated California's gifts law by taking at least 28 all-
expense-paid trips funded by companies tied to telecommunications firms that do business with
the city, according to a complaint filed with the state.

In her filing with the California Fair Political Practices Commission, Jeanne Fleming of United
Neighbors contends Chieflnformation Officer Jonathan Reichental took illegal trips totaling 114
days between 2013 and 2017. United Neighbors is a group of local resident who unsuccessfully
fought the City Council's approval last year of a Verizon Wireless project to install 11 cell
towers in the Midtown, South of Midtown, St. Claire Gardens and Palo Verde neighborhoods.

According to public records that Fleming acquired, Reichental's trips included a trip in 2016
to China for six days and one to the French Riviera for three days, both paid for by TM Forum, a
global trade association that seeks "to maximize the business success of communication and
digital service providers and their ecosystem of suppliers," according to its website.

Another trip had him spending seven days in Melbourne, Australia, in October 2017, paid for by
Blockchain Association of Australia, an organization formed in 2017 to support Australia's
blockchain community. Blockchain, originally devised for digital currency, is being hailed in
tech circles as the backbone of a new type of internet., the records indicate.

"The crux of my complaint is two-fold," Fleming said in an email. "First, Dr. Reichental has
been taking expensive junkets all over the world paid for, in particular, by the
telecommunications industry. And second, Dr. Reichental has used his position ... to influence
the City's dealings with the telecommunications industry. What he is doing is both unethical and
a violation of California law."

City Manager James Keene defended Reichental's travel, saying in an interview that he takes the
trips on his own time and never receives compensation for his involvement in the conferences.
Reichental, who oversees a department of more than 30 and reports directly to the city manager,
was not immediately available for comment. City staff said he was on vacation.

"I have the utmost confidence in the professional ethics of our chief information officer," Keene
said. "As long as we can keep him working for our city government with the talents and the
perspective he has, we are way ahead of the curve."

An FPPC official confirmed receiving the complaint Tuesday, but the agency has not yet
determined whether it will conduct an investigation.

Fleming's complaint alleges that on travel forms he filed with the state, Reichental "repeatedly
mischaracterized the parties paying for his trips as 501(c)(3) nonprofits, although they clearly are
not ... in order to evade the constraints imposed by California gift law."

New Jersey-based TM Forum, for instance, was listed in 2016 as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit on its tax
forms, which is not exempt from gift law limits of $4 70 per entity each year. She also alleges he
has taken all-expense-paid trips that he failed to report. Both of those allegations, if proven true,
would constitute gift law violations, punishable by fines of up to $5,000 in each case.

Reichental said by email Tuesday that he has reported all his trips with the state, does not believe
any were paid for by telecom firms or agencies that represent telecom firms and that the purpose
of the trips "was almost exclusively as an educator."

"All of the flights and hotels were paid for by other governments, public-sector entities, not-for-
profits, and educational institutions," he wrote.

Reichental stated he made an error reporting that a trip to a TM Forum smart cities conference in-
Yinchuan, China, in September 2016 was paid for by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. He said he plans to
correct it "and make other small corrections should they exist" immediately after he returns from
vacation.
Councilman Tom DuBois, who is aware of Fleming's complaint, said he has asked the city
attorney to look into the matter.

"Even if the trips were all on vacation, there's a question of, you're working for the city of Palo
Alto, where's your focus? Are you focusing on your job?" DuBois said Tuesday. "It looks
troubling, but I kind of want to get the full story .... Jonathan's worked really hard for the city. I
don't want to jump to conclusions."

Keene said the city hired Reichental away from the private sector in December 2011 - he was
chief information officer for O'Reilly Media and director of innovation for
PricewaterhouseCoopers before joining the city - specifically because Reichental would help
Palo Alto become a smart city. Keene credits Reichental for upgrading the city's Wi-Fi network,
moving data into the cloud, working toward universal fiber-based internet access, creating an
open data portal and putting city employees through cybersecurity training.

Keene said Reichental has not played a role in approvals of cell antennas. He said those are land
use and legal issues handled by other departments.

But Fleming argues in her complaint that even ifReichental played no direct role in Verizon's
recent approvals, as chair of the city's Connected Cities working group, which oversees telecom
projects in the city, he's directly involved in telecom-related matters, including those placed
before the City Council for approval.

For example, Reichental on a Jan. 18, 2017 "Connected Cities" agenda is listed as "owner" of a
number of items involving Verizon, including "90 site DAS project entering ARB review,"
which refers to Verizon' s plan to install 90 cell towers in residential neighborhoods, including
the 11 approved last year.

              the city with the group United Neighbors, claims that
              Reichental's travel is funded by the telecommunications
              industry and is illegal under the state's gift tax law for
              government officials.


              "Dr. Reichental has been using his senior position at City Hall to
              influence the city's dealings with the telecommunications
              industry," Fleming said. "This includes shaping the city's
              response to the applications telecom companies have made to
              install cell towers in Palo Alto's residential neighborhoods."


              Fleming claims that in 2016, TMForum, a telecommunications
              industry trade association, paid for Reichental to travel to China
              and the French Riviera.


              Reichental identified TM Forum as a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit on his
             financial disclosure forms, when the organization's most recent
             tax return indicated that it is a 501 (c)(6), in violation of the $470
             gift limit.

              A 501 (c)(6) organization - typically a business league, chamber
              of commerce or board of trade - is allowed to engage in                               :RETIREMENT
              lobbying related to its purpose. A 501 (c)(3) organization is a
              charitable organization that is not permitted to operate for the
              benefit of private interests and is more restricted in its political

Subject:          Special dispensations for President Hotel conversion



Dear Mayor Kniss and City Council members,

        This is another potentially contentious city council meeting, where you are proposing to
accept changes to city ordinances that favor conversion of President Hotel (currently providing
high density housing for ~ 75 tenants) to a regular Hotel – with special dispensations, by making
changes to city ordinances ‐ such as allowing the conversion [ by planning to grant, grandfathered
facilities exception] in the first place, secondly granting exceptions to providing open space by
allowing the project to build a roof top “ garden “, thirdly planning to give parking exemptions [ AJ
capital even asking for more than $13 million in parking in‐lieu fees] and finally removing the cap
on downtown non‐residential development.

       When one looks at the proposed changes, they are surprisingly generous – being given to
make the whole project very lucrative to AJ Capital and their investors. As Mr. Dave price of Daily
post pointed out this morning, AJ Capital might have made a big mistake not researching the
feasibility of the project in the first place and paying a premium price of $65 million for something
that he thinks might have been worth around half that sum. Be that may, thanks to Mr. Jeff
Levinsky, who first alerted the city to zoning code restrictions that prevent the hotel conversion,
before the purchase of the property by AJ Captial – there was enough information for the city
staff to seriously question and not make recommendations to the City Council to go ahead.

      As the detailed analyses and commentary [an editorial] in two recent editions (Nov 30th and
Dec 7th) of Palo Alto Weekly point out, there are many irregularities in this whole AJ Capital
related goings on. The changing of the position by the city staff is one of the big ones. I wonder
whose interests are being served by these staff recommendations? Might the prospects of
increased tax revenues from another potentially expensive Hotel, be clouding their judgment? In
addition the large number of private meetings between city staff and AJ Capital representatives
[whose advisors include, senior ex‐city staff}, just one cursory meeting with the public is very
disturbing and highly irregular. I wonder if it might be in the interest of open government to have
all city staff sign an agreement that they do not become lobbyists for a period of at least 5 years,
once they leave office. I believe President Obama had something similar requirement from his
staff (I believe the time period might have been shorter, I am not sure, exactly how short).


                                                         1
     In terms of what the city staff and the majority in the Council are trying to do by speeding up
important decisions in the waning days of the present council, this is again a huge area of concern
to us the residents [we have been trying to hammer our points again and again with limited
success it appears!]. It looks like Mr. Wolbach and Mr. Scharff want to get these changes done in
a hurry, before they leave. The comments of Mr. Fine in the council meeting of the 3rd also
appear to push this growth agenda with urgency that doesn’t seem to be warranted – given that
the changes sought by AJ Capital and being pushed by the pro‐growth part of the city council, do
not, I repeat, do not increase housing in the city, while simultaneously eliminating 75 moderate
housing units from the city’s existing stock, if the President Hotel conversion is allowed to go
through. Threats of lawsuits, etc, by AJ Capital should not be allowed to dictate city priorities and
decisions under the present circumstances.

     In addition, the Dec 10th and 17th deadlines that AJ Capital is pushing with the threat of
withdrawing from their agreement with some of the unfortunate tenants to provide material
support by extending their stay to Amy of next year and also, helping them with subsidized rents
(by buying their silence) – is a hard ball tactic that should not go unchallenged. When you
estimate the amount of money (~ $1 million atmost) that AJ Capital has to spend on this
diversionary tactic, it is really peanuts, in the scheme of what’s at stake!

   Shouldn’t the priorities be to help encourage housing projects, especially moderate, below
market rate units? The price points for these moderate and BMR units should strive to make
available housing options for people who really are desperate and to bring some balance. Having
people commute over vast distances to serve our community is not particularly “ green “ and we
should be helping to reverse this trend to the extent possible.

    Rhetorically I would like to pose this question, “ Having dropped the ball on due diligence in
the first place and having paid a huge premium for the property, what other choices [besides
threatening lawsuits] do they have ? “. The city council should not be intimidated and acquiesce
to AJ Capital’s demands and reward them and their investors. This sets a very bad precedent to
what will surely follow in terms of development proposals and projects by various financial
interests.

     I believe all the council members are aware of the above arguments and points I have raised
and I hope you don’t buckle under and screw up this decision. The residents will clearly be
watching what you do and then may have to decide on the course of action that may be available
for redress.

Thanks for listening,

Ranganath,

Subject:                Thank you for saving the "Resident" Hotel


Dear Mayor Kniss, Jonathan, Jim and Council Members:

Thank you very much for saving the President Hotel as a Resident Hotel. I experienced such a sense of relief and gratitude that we
residents have influence at City Hall, that you are listening to us.

Last night, I heard your words, Mayor Kniss, Jim and others, of surprise and dismay as to community attitudes surrounding recent
actions by staff and council. I apologize for the uncharitable tone that I have been exercising lately toward your efforts to lead our
city. Please know that there is nothing personal in it. What you are witnessing is community frustration at the directions this town has
been taking. And yes, that’s a shot across the bow of city leadership. No doubt about it. But it didn’t start with you all. It’s a pattern,
long in the making. Still, I know it’s gotta hurt, when you feel you are doing your hardest to serve.

Liken us, if you would, to the hypothetical faithful wife whose hypothetical husband has cheated on her and even though he says it was
over years ago and is bending over backwards to prove it, she’s still looking for lipstick stains everywhere. City leadership hasn’t
always been straight with the residents, nor gone out of its way to secure our good faith. It’s hard to repair that trust. It can be done,
but it takes time.

I heard Adrian when he said that he wants those of us who spoke to preserve housing last night to come and support new housing
proposals as they come forward. And I promise to do so as long as new projects are balanced with the interests and needs of the
people that currently live here, and not unfairly shouldered by one community, namely Ventura. That seems fair. How we define fair,
however, has different connotations, and therein lies the rub. However, I will be open. And I’ll take what I learn back to my fellow
Venturans. That I promise.

Also I’ll take Jim up on his offer for staff to meet with residents and educate us to foster more openness. In the new year, we residents
can confab with Ed and Jonathan, if they are receptive, to work up some kind of “rap” sessions where a group of us come in and see
how you guys think and how you work - and you can understand what “makes us tick.” That would be a great way to build a bridge
between residents and staff. And how about reinvigorating town hall meetings? That will add more work to staff’s already full
plates. However, If we make more of an effort to empathize and understand, then I think all sides will be more open to
compromise. We will all save time in the long run and finally put paid to these marathon council meetings that last until all hours.

I love living in Ventura which is why I can’t help but come downtown and give you all the business when I get the impression that you
are not listening to us. Please take this as a compliment — that I I care so much about everything you do.

Again, my apologies for being a party to causing undue stress on the dais and giving you grief. I’m looking forward to 2019. Thank
you all for your service to this city, and best wishes to those of you who are stepping down at the end of the year.

Kind regards,

Becky Sanders

We are concerned about the situation with installation of the new cell towers in our neighborhood and are asking you
please:

        1. To reverse your May 21st decision allowing Verizon to install its cheap, ugly and potentially
             hazardous equipment aboveground next to people’s homes;

        2. To direct City Staff to vigorously enforce Palo Alto’s aesthetics, noise and other ordinances
             with respect to the siting and installation of cell towers near residences; and, more
             specifically,

        3. To direct City Staff to stop advising the Planning and Transportation Commission to
             incorporate the FCC’s aggressively pro-telecommunications-industry October order into our
             municipal ordinances.



Sincerely,

December 10, 2018

Dear City Council,

I understand that measures to help enable the conversion of the President Hotel from housing to a hotel is on the
agenda this evening.
I am disappointed to see staff leaving out the main reason for their urgency.

It is in the city's comprehensive plan that we need to add housing, and the target is much higher than we have achieved
in the past few years.
Losing the residences at the President Hotel would be a big step backwards.

First, I urge you to stand up for Palo Alto's interests. Do not pass ordinances to change development rules, and enable
this conversion.
Work to keep this building residential. At least leave this for the next council to decide.

Second, how is it that this purchase and conversion was such an attractive deal? If we want housing, instead of hotels
being developed around downtown, we do have to change the rules, so that a housing development can be the most
attractive investment. I think you have worked on this in the past month, and I hope you will keep working to improve
the financial incentives for more and denser housing. In the best case, the developers would go back to the drawing
board and figure out how to operate the President Hotel as residences.

Thank you for your service to Palo Alto,

Robert Neff

To Whom It May Concern,

Greetings, we are seventh graders from Eleanor Murray Fallon Middle School in Dublin, California, and we are
here to tell you about a cause that is occuring in the ocean. We have seen your amazing city in our own eyes .
We think it is absolutely gorgeous. We love your city and how they work. We have seen your city and we would
love to have you help us out. In the Bay Area, there is plastic that is going into our oceans. Sea creatures
sometimes ar being massacred from the deadly plastic.

The design that cities are using don't filter out the micro-sized plastic bits, and that is one of the main things
that sea creatures are consuming. To start off with, animals think that plastic is their everyday food.1 Also, sea
creatures are having a hard time eating plastic and they are slowly suffering. The estimated amount of animals
that are dying are 100,000.2 To add on, the chemicals in the plastic are very harmful to the sea creature, and
the smaller the pieces are, the more dangerous the plastic is for their body. 3 Finally, sea creature populations
are being decimated by the unending stream of plastic microfibers, caused by us humans.4 All in all, sea
creatures are dying every single day from plastic in our ocean which could ultimately cause them to become
extinct.

We decided to create a draining system in the pipes to the ocean. Our design is cheap, small, and it uses a
micro-grid filter to filter out microplastics which travels through the pipes. We would like for you guys to look at
our design idea that is clipped to this letter so that you get a better idea of our plan. We hope you will concern
with our suggestion and take action soon.

The work that you guys have done to your city helps make it what it is today, I we are thankful for that. Our
ocean is now drowning in plastic and is taking a closer look to what is occurring daily to natures marine wildlife.
We would like for you guys to contact us via mail about what you think about our plan.Thank you for taking the
time to read this letter.

Sfn

 Re: Street Sweeping

 Dear Mr. Seeley:

WE have now arrived in the rainy season and parts of Palo Alto Avenue between
Seneca and Hale still have not been swept. The parts that are ,are poorly swept at
least on my area of the street. There are no posted signs to say no parking because of
sweeping on a certain day. How easy it would be. The problem is not just due to
vegetation but in large part to parked cars which do not belong to the residents.

The vegetation that you seem to think is the problem, is still there since your letter of
October 10.

Your plans not to post NO PARKING signs is absolutely ridiculous. Here we are as
taxpayers, on the creek which overflows here and needs cleared streets and you have
some arbitrary "plan" not to put up signs.

 It is bad enough that we have the commuter parking that we dol.

Yours truly,



Caroline Knopf

DECEMBER 10, 2018, CITY COUNCIL MEETING, AGENDA ITEM #16
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDING MUNICIPAL CODE SECTION 18.18.120

CROSS REFERENCE: 488 UNIVERSITY AVENUE (PRESIDENT HOTEL)


Dear City Council:

I urge you to remove this item from your agenda, because the
proposed ordinance violates the Ralph M. Brown Act and the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

In addition, the proposed ordinance is an ordinance that
increases property owners development rights, requires two
readings, and is subject to referendum, while the findings and
declarations in the proposed ordinance includes language that is
copied from California Government Code Section 65858 that exists
to authorize interim ordinances to prohibit a property owner
from using his or her property to protect the planning process
so that the property owner could not introduce potentially
nonconforming land uses that could defeat a later adopted
Comprehensive Plan or Zoning Ordinance.

Further, the staff report for this agenda item ( ID # 9910) at
Page 3 says, "The proposed ordinance seeks to revert the
Downtown non-complying facilities regulations back to the pre-
2016 standard", and at Page 2 says, "The change may have been
unintentional and occurred in January 2016", but d o cuments
available in the City Clerk's office and online demonstrate that
the language has existed in the Palo Alto Municipal Code since
at least 2006, and I believe records available elsewhere will
show that the language has been in the Zoning Ordinance even
earlier than that.
Brown Act Violation

The primary purpose of this proposed ordinance is to enable the
conversion of the property at 488 University Avenue from rental
apartments to a hotel.

The failure to include that fact in the agenda description is a
violation of the Brown Act.


CEQA Violation

CEQA Regulation 15378(a) defines "project" as the whole of an
action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct
physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable
indirect physical change in the environment", including "(1) An
activity undertaken by any public agency."

CEQA Regulation 15378(d) says, "Where the Lead Agency could
describe the project as either the adoption of a particular
regulation under subdivision (a) (1) or as a development proposal
which will be subject to several governmental approvals .. the
Lead Agency shall describe the project as the development
proposal for the purpose of environmental analysis . 1>

Therefore, the CEQA project is the proposed conversion of 488
University Avenue from apartments to a hotel, and the regulation
in the subject agenda item is part of that CEQA project.

Segmenting this agenda item from the CEQA analysis of the
development project is a violation of CEQA and a prejudicial
abuse of discretion.
                                                    ~
The project is not exempt from CEQA under either of~sons
given in the agenda description and staff report.

The reasons why the project is not exempt are included in the
arguments in July 27, 2018, letter from Heather Minner of Shute,
Mihaly & Weinberger LLP that appears in the Public Letters to
Council in the August 13, 2018, City Council Agenda Packet on
pages 90-96 at:
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?t
=45470.91&BlobID=66185
Palo Alto Municipal Code Section 18.18.120(b) (2).

The proposed ordinance seeks to delete language in PAMC Section
18.18.120 that the Planning Director claims was added to the
Municipal Code inadvertently in error by means of cutting and
pasting the language from someplace else, although he is careful
in not citing the source of the "cut-and-paste" language because
there is none.

The language in question has been part of the Municipal Code
continuously since at least 2006 when the Council adopted
Ordinance No. 4923, and I believe that the same language has
been in the Municipal Code continuously longer than that, but
due to a gap in the City Clerk's records I was unable to verify
that fact today, but I believe there are other records that
confirm my belief and I will let you know that as soon as I am
able to access those records.

The language that staff proposes to delete is at Page 64 of
Ordinance No. 4923 introduced October 16, 2006, adopted November
6, 2006, and effective December 7, 2006, or twelve years ago,
and is available online at:
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/19591.

I realize that there may be further actions on the subject of
this agenda item in other forums.
                      " fa " ,· d\ ':'.1
Therefore, I will be ~re-rv·i~ a copy of this letter to the City
Clerk with a certified copy attached of Ordinance No. 4923 for
inclusion in the Public Letters to Council in the next City
Council Agenda Packet, and for the Administrative Record of
these proceedings and other proceedings regarding 488 University
Avenue.

Sincerely,

 ~
Herb Borock

                   REGULATIONS) OF THE PALO ALTO MUNICIPAL CODE



               The Council of the City of Palo Alto does ORDAIN as follows:

               SECTION 1.      Findings and Declarations. The City Council finds and declares as
follows:
             (a) That in December 2000, the City Council approved a work plan for the Zoning
Ordinance Update involving the preparation of a new Title 18 (Zoning Code) of the Palo Alto
Municipal Code (PAMC), including the update of existing land use chapters and processes as
well as the preparation of chapters for new and revised land uses;

             (b) The 1998-2010 Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan includes several programs and
policies related to commercial and mixed use development. The Zoning Ordinance Update was
initiated in part to accomplish these programs and policies.

           (c) The last comprehensive update of the Palo Alto Zoning Code took place in
1978. Provisions for commercial and mixed use development in that update do not respond to
current Comprehensive Plan goals and highly constrain and create a cumbersome review process
for mixed use development.

18.16.010               Purposes
The commercial zoning districts are intended to create and maintain sites for retail, personal
services, eating and drinking establishments, hotels and other business uses in a manner that
balances the needs of those uses with the need to minimize impacts to surrounding
neighborhoods.

(a)    Neighborhood Commercial [CN]
       The CN neighborhood commercial district is intended to create and maintain neighborhood
       shopping areas primarily accommodating retail sales, personal service, eating and drinking,
       and office uses of moderate size serving the immediate neighborhood, under regulations
       that will assure maximum compatibility with surrounding residential areas.

061204 syn 0120176
(c)    Community Commercial (2) Subdistrict [CC(2)]
       The community commercial (2) (CC(2)) subdistrict is intended to modify the site
       development regulations of the CC community commercial district, where applied in
       combination with such district, to allow site specific variations to the community
       commercial uses and development requirements in the CC district.

(d)    Service Commercial [CS]
       The CS service commercial district is intended to create and maintain areas
       accommodating citywide and regional services that may be inappropriate in neighborhood
       or pedestrian-oriented shopping areas, and which generally require automotive access for
       customer convenience, servicing of vehicles or equipment, loading or unloading, or
       parking of commercial service vehicles.

18.16.020                Applicable Regulations
(a)      Applicable Chapters

       The specific regulations of this chapter and the additional regulations and procedures
       established by other relevant Chapters of the Zoning Code shall apply to the CN, CS, and
       CC districts, and the subdistrict designated as CC(2), as shown on the City's Zoning Map.
       The term "abutting residential zones," where used in this Chapter, includes the Rl, R2,
       RMD, RM-15, RM-30, RM-40, or residential Planned Community (PC) districts, unless
       otherwise specifically noted.

(b)      Applicable Combining Districts

         The combining districts applicable to the CN, CS,. and CC(2) districts shall include,
         but shall not be limited to, the following districts:
       (1)    The retail shopping (R) combining d~lations, as specified in Chapter 18.46,
              shall apply to the area of the CN, C S - districts designated as "R" combining
              district as shown on the City's Zoning Map.

       (2)    The pedestrian shopping (P) combining district regulations, as specified in Chapter
              18.47, shall apply to the area of the CN, CS,. and CC(2) districts designated "P"
              combining district as shown on the City's Zoning Map.

18.16.030                Definitions
For the purposes of this section, the following terms are defined:

(a)    "Charleston Shopping Center" is defined as all properties zoned CN and bounded by East
       Charleston Road, Middlefield Road, and Cubberley Community Center.

(b)    "Midtown Shopping District" is defined as all properties zoned CN in the vicinity of the
       intersection of Colorado A venue and Middlefield Road which border Moreno Avenue,
       Bryson Avenue, Colorado Avenue, and San Carlos Court, or which border Middlefield
       Road in the area extending from Moreno Avenue to San Carlos Court.

061204 syn 0120176
(e)      "Neighborhood-serving offices" are medical offices, professional offices, travel agencies,
         and insurance agencies that fit the definition of a neighborhood-serving use.

(f)      A "Neighborhood Serving Use" is a use that primarily serves individual consumers and
         households, not businesses, is generally pedestrian oriented in design, and does not
         generate noise, fumes or truck traffic greater than that typically expected for uses with a
         local customer base. A neighborhood-serving use is also one to which a significant
         number of customers and clients travel, rather than the provider of the goods or services
         traveling off-site.

(g)      "Ground Floor" shall mean the first floor that is above grade.

(h)      "Mixed Use Development" shall mean a combination of nonresidential and residential uses
         arranged on a site. The uses may be combined in a vertical configuration (within a
         building) or in a horizontal configuration (separate buildings).

18.16.040                                          Land Uses
The uses of land allowed by this chapter in each commercial zoning district are identified in the
following tables. Land uses that are not listed on the tables are not allowed, except where
otherwise noted. Where the last column on the following tables ("Subject to Regulations in")
includes a section number, specific regulations in the referenced section also apply to the use;
however, provisions in other sections may apply as well.

(a)      Commercial Zones and Land Uses
Permitted and conditionally permitted land uses for each commercial zone are shown in Table 1:
                                          Table 1: CN,      CC(2) and CS Permitted and Conditional Uses

(d)             Charleston Shopping Center: Additional Use Restrictions
               (1)               Any office use first occupying space at the Center on or after January 16, 2001, shall
                                 obtain a written determination from the director of planning and community
                                 environment that it qualifies as a neighborhood serving use, as defined in this chapter,
                                 before occupying its premises. The applicant shall submit such information as the
                                 director shall reasonably require in order to make the determination, and the director
                                 shall issue the determination within 30 days of receiving a complete application.
                                 Failure to submit the required information shall be grounds for determining that a
                                 business is not neighborhood-serving.
               (2)               No more than 7,850 square feet of total floor area at the Center shall be occupied by
                                 office uses at any time.
               (3)               Prior to approving a conditional use permit for neighborhood-serving offices larger
                                 than 2,500 square feet in total floor area, the city shall find that the proposed use will
                                 be neighborhood-serving, that it will be conducted in a manner that will enhance and
                                 strengthen the Center as a neighborhood resource, and that it will not diminish the
                                 retail strength of the center.
(e)             Midtown Shopping Center: Additional Use Restrictions
               (1)               An existing ground floor office may be replaced with another office if
                                 (a)               the new tenant or owner will continue the existing business or practice; or
                                 (b)                a conditional use permit is issued for the new office use.
               (2)               No conditional use permit shall be issued for any new office use on the ground floor
                                 unless, in addition to the findings required for a conditional use permit as specified in
                                 Chapter 18.76.010, the City finds that the proposed use will be neighborhood serving,
                                 that it will be conducted in a manner that will enhance and strengthen the Midtown
                                 Shopping District as a neighborhood resource, and that it will not diminish the retail
                                 strength of the District.

18.16.090                   Context-Based Design Criteria
(a) Contextual and Compatibility Criteria

       Development in a commercial district shall be responsible to its context and compatible
       with adjacent development, and shall promote the establishment of pedestrian oriented
       design.

       (1)           Context

                     (A)   Context as used in this section is intended to indicate relationships
                           between the site's development to adjacent street types, surrounding land
                           uses, and on-site or nearby natural features, such as creeks or trees.
                           Effective transitions to these adjacent uses and features are strongly
                           reinforced by Comprehensive Plan policies.

                     (B)   The word "context" should not be construed as a desire to replicate
                           existing surroundings, but rather to provide appropriate transitions to those
                           surroundings. "Context" is also not specific to architectural style or
                           design, though in some instances relationships may be reinforced by an
                           architectural response.

       (2)           Compatibility

                     (A)   Compatibility is achieved when the apparent scale and mass of new
                           buildings is consistent with the pattern of achieving a pedestrian oriented
                           design, and when new construction shares general characteristics and
                           establishes design likages with the overall pattern of buildings so that the
                           visual unity of the street is maintained.

                     (B)   Compatibility goals may be accomplished through various means,
                           including but not limited to:
                           (i)    the siting, scale, massing, and materials;
                           (ii)   the rhythmic pattern of the street established by the general width
                                  of the buildings and the spacing between them;
                           (iii}  the pattern of roof lines and projections;
                           (iv)   the sizes, proportions, and orientations of windows, bays and
                                  dooiways;
                           (v)    the location and treatment of entryways;
                           (vi)   the shadow patterns from massing and decorative features;
                           (vii) the siting and treatment of parking; and
                           (viii) the treatment of landscaping.

(b)    Context-Based Design Considerations and Findings

       In addition to the findings for Architectural Review contained in Section 18.76.020(d) of
       the Zoning Ordinance, the following additional findings are applicable in the CN, CS, CC
       and CC(2) districts, as further illustrated on the accompanying diagrams:

(4)     Low-Density Residential Transitions
Where new projects are built abutting existing lower-scale residential development, care
shall be taken to respect the scale and privacy of neighboring properties through:

A. Transitions of development intensity
   from higher density development
   building types to building types that are
   compatible with the lower intensity
   surrounding uses (Figure 4-1 );



                                               (Figure 4-1)

B. Massing and orientation of buildings
   that respect and mirror the massing of
   neighboring structures by stepping back
   upper stories to transition to smaller
   scale buildings, including setbacks and
   daylight planes that match abutting R-1
   and R-2 zone requirements (Figure 4-

C. Common open spaces should connect
   to the pedestrian pathways and existing
   natural amenities of the site and its
   surroundings;

D. Usable open space may be any
   combination of private and common
   spaces;

E. Usable open space does not need to be
   located on the ground and may be
   located in porches, decks, balconies
   and/or podiums (but not on rooftops)
   (Figure 5-1 );

F. Open space should be located to
   activate the street fayade and increase
   "eyes on the street" when possible
   (Figure 5-1 );

G. Both private and common open space
   areas should be buffered from noise
   where feasible through landscaping and
   building placement;

(6)    Parking Design
Parking needs shall be accommodated but shall not be allowed to overwhelm the
character of the project or detract from the pedestrian environment, such that:

A. Parking is located behind buildings,
   below grade or, where those options are
   not feasible, screened by landscaping,
   low walls, etc.;

B. Structured parking is fronted or
   wrapped with habitable uses when
   possible (Figure 6-1);                      Parking podiums 5haQbe fronted or wrapped With hab~able et· active uses when
                                               possible.

                                              (Figure 6-1)
C. Parking that is semi-depressed is
   screened with architectural elements
   that enhance the streetscape such as
   stoops, balcony overhangs, and/or art;

D. Landscaping such as trees, shrubs,
   vines, or groundcover is incorporated
   into surface parking lots (Figure 6-2);




                                                ~ping       such as trees. shrubs. vines or ground cOYer is incorporated rnlo

E. For properties with parking access from
   the rear of the site (such as a rear alley
   or driveway) landscaping shall provide
   a visual buffer between vehicle
   circulation areas and abutting properties
   (Figure 6-3);

F. Street parking is utilized for visitor or
   customer parking and is designed in a
   manner to enhance traffic calming;             !al1llnm RHld1nll1I     Mint'

G. For properties with parking accessed         (Figure 6-3)
     from the front, minimize the amount of
     frontage used for parking access, no
     more than 25% of the site frontage
     facing a street should be devoted to
     garage openings, carports, or
     open/surface parking (on sites with less
     than 100 feet of frontage, no more than
     25 feet);

H. Where two parking lots abut and it is
   possible for a curb cut and driveway to
   serve several properties, owners are
                                                When possible. ad'iacent properties are strongly encounaed to share drivew.iys
   strongly encouraged to enter in to           to limit curb cuts

   shared access agreements (Figure 6-4);
   and                                          (Figure 6-4)

I.   Parking is accessed from side streets or
     alle s when ossible.

(7)     Large (multi-acre) Sites
Large (in excess of one acre) sites shall be designed so that street, block, and building
patterns are consistent with those of the surrounding neighborhood, and such that:

A. New development of large sites
   maintains and enhances connectivity
   with a hierarchy of public streets,
                                                                         ,.v

B. The diversity of building types
   increases with increased lot size (e.g.,    (Figure 7-1)
   <1 acre = minimum 1 building type; 1-
   2 acres = minimum 2 housing types;
   greater than 2 acres = minimum 3
   housing types) (Figures 7-1 through 7-
   3); and

C. Where a site includes more than one
   housing type, each building type should
   respond to its inunediate context in
   terms of scale, massing, and design
   (e.g., Village Residential building types
   facing or abutting existing single-
   family residences) (Figures 7-2 and 7-
   3).

(8)     Sustainability and Green Building Design
Project design and materials to achieve sustainability and green building design should be
incorporated into the project. Green building design considers the envirorunent during
design and construction. Green building design aims for compatibility with the local
environment: to protect, respect and benefit from it. In general, sustainable buildings are
energy efficient, water conserving, durable and nontoxic, with high-quality spaces and
high recycled content materials. The following considerations should be included in site
and building design:

A. Optimize building orientation for heat

18.18.090                Parking and Loading
The provisions of Chapter 18.83 shall apply within the CD district, except the provisions of
Chapter 18.83 regarding on-site and off-site parking for non-residential uses within an
assessment district wherein properties are assessed under a Bond Plan G financing pursuant to
Title 13. With respect to such uses, the following requirements shall apply in the CD district in
lieu of the requirements in Chapter 18.83:

(a)    On-Site Parking Requirement
       Any new development, any addition or enlargement of existing development, or any use of
       any floor area that has never been assessed under any Bond Plan G financing pursuant to
       Title 13, shall provide one parking space for each two hundred fifty gross square feet of
       floor area, except as may be exempt from such requirement by the provisions of subsection
       (b) of this section. The purpose of this subsection is to regulate the number of parking
       spaces required. Requirements for the size and other design criteria for parking spaces shall
       continue to be governed by the provisions of Chapter 18.83.

(b)    Exceptions to On-Site Parking Requirement
       The requirement for on-site parking provided in subsection (a) of this section shall not
       apply in the following circumstances:
       ( 1)    The following square footage shall be exempt from the on-site parking requirement
               of subsection (a):
               (A)   Square footage for handicapped access which does not increase the usable
                     floor area, as determined by Code Section 18.18.060(e);
               (B)   An increase in square footage in conjunction with seismic or historic
                     rehabilitation, pursuant to Code Section 18.18.070;
               (C)   An increase in square footage for buildings not in Seismic Category I, II, or II
                     or Historic Category l or 2 pursuant to Code Section 18.18.070(a)(l);
               (D)   Square footage for at or above grade parking, though such square footage is
                     included in the FAR calculations in Section 18.18.060(a).
       (2)     A conversion to commercial use of a historic building in Categories 1 and 2 shall be
               exempt from the on-site parking requirement in subsection (a), provided that the
               building is fifty feet or less in height and has most recently been in residential use.
               Such conversion, in order to be exempt, shall be done in conjunction with exterior
               historic rehabilitation approved by the director of planning and community
               environment upon the recommendation of the architectural review board in
               consultation with the historic resources board. Such conversion must not eliminate
               any existing on-site parking.
       (3)     Vacant parcels shall be exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this
               section at the time when development occurs as provided herein. Such development
                                                  49
061204 syn 0120176
               shall be exempt to the extent of parking spaces for every one thousand square feet of
               site area, provided that such parcels were at some time assessed for parking under a
               Bond Plan E financing pursuant to Chapter 13.16 or were subject to other ad valorem
               assessments for parking.
       (4)     No new parking spaces will be required for a site in conjunction with the
               development or replacement of the amount of floor area used for nonresidential use
               equal to the amount of adjusted square footage for the site shown on the engineer's
               report for fiscal year 1986-87 for the latest Bond Plan G financing for parking
               acquisition or improvements in that certain area of the city delineated on the map of
               the University Avenue parking assessment district entitled, "Proposed Boundaries of
               University Avenue Off-Street Parking Project #75-63 Assessment District, City of
               Palo Alto, County of Santa Clara, State of California," dated October 30, 1978, and
               on file with the city clerk. However, square footage which was developed for
               nonresidential purposes or which has been used for nonresidential purposes but
               which is not used for such purposes due to vacancy at the time of the engineer's
               report shall be included in the amount of floor area qualifying for this exemption. No
               exemption from parking requirements shall be available where a residential use
               changes to a nonresidential use, except pursuant to subsection (2).

(c)    Off-Site Parking
       Parking required by this chapter may be provided by off-site parking, provided that such
       off-site parking is within a reasonable distance of the site using it or, ifthe site is within an
       assessment district, within a reasonable distance of the assessment district boundary and
       approved in writing by the director of planning and community environment. The director
       shall assure that sufficient covenants and guarantees are provided to ensure use and
       maintenance of such parking facilities, including an enforceable agreement that any
       development occurring on the site where parking is provided shall not result in a net
       reduction of parking spaces provided, considering both the parking previously provided
       and the parking required by the proposed use.

(d)    In-lieu Parking Provisions
       In connection with any expansion of the supply of public parking spaces within the CD
       commercial downtown district, the city shall allocate a number of spaces for use as "in-lieu
       parking" spaces to allow development to occur on sites which would otherwise be
       precluded from development due to parking constraints imposed by monetary contribution
       to the city to defray the cost of providing such parking. Contributions for each required
       parking space shall equal the incremental cost of providing a net new parking space in an
       assessment district project plus cost for the administration of the program, all as
       determined pursuant to Chapter 16.57 of Title 16 of this code, by the director of planning
       and community environment, whose decision shall be final. Only sites satisfying one or
       more of the following criteria, as determined by the director of planning and community
       environment, shall be eligible to participate in the in-lieu parking program:
       (1)     Construction of on-site parking would necessitate destruction or substantial
               demolition of a designated historic structure;


                                                   50
061204 syn 0120176
        (2)    the site area is less than 10,000 square feet, but of such an unusual configuration
               that it would not be physically feasible to provide the required on-site parking;
       (3)     The site is greater than 10,000 square feet, but of such an unusual configuration that
               it would not be physically feasible to provide the required on-site parking;
       (4)     The site is located in an area where city policy precludes curb cuts or otherwise
               prevents use of the site for on-site parking; or
       (5)     The site has other physical constraints, such as a high groundwater table, which
               preclude provision of on-site parking without extraordinary expense.

(e)    Underground Parking
       Underground parking deeper than two levels below grade shall be prohibited unless a soils
       report or engineering analysis demonstrates that regular pumping of subsurface water will
       not be required.

18.18.100                   Performance Standards
In addition to the standards for development prescribed above, all development shall comply
with the perfonnance criteria outlined in Chapter 18.64 of the Zoning Ordinance. All mixed use
development shall also comply with the provisions of Chapter 18.28 of the Zoning Ordinance.

18.18.110                   Context-Based Design Criteria
(a)    Contextual and Compatibility Criteria

       Development in a commercial district shall be responsible to its context and compatible
       with adjacent development, and shall promote the establishment of pedestrian oriented
       design.

       (1)           Context

                     (A)   Context as used in this section is intended to indicate relationships
                           between the site's development to adjacent street types, surrounding land
                           uses, and on-site or nearby natural features, such as creeks or trees.
                           Effective transitions to these adjacent uses and features are strongly
                           reinforced by Comprehensive Plan policies. ·

                     (B)   The word "context" should not be construed as a desire to replicate
                           existing surroundings, but rather to provide appropriate transitions to those
                           surroundings. "Context" is also not specific to architectural style or
                           design, though in some instances relationships may be reinforced by an
                           architectural response.

       (2)           Compatibility

                     (A)   Compatibility is achieved when the apparent scale and mass of new
                           buildings is consistent with the pattern of achieving a pedestrian oriented
                           design, and when new construction shares general characteristics and
                                                    51
061204 syn 0120176
                          establishes design likages with the overall pattern of buildings so that the
                          visual unity of the street is maintained.

                    (B)   Compatibility goals may be accomplished through various means,
                          including but not limited to:
                          (i)     the siting, scale, massing, and materials;
                          (ii)    the rhythmic pattern of the street established by the general width
                          of the buildings and the spacing between them;
                          (iii)   the pattern of roof lines and projections;
                          (iv)    the sizes, proportions, and orientations of windows, bays and
                          doorways;
                          (v)     the location and treatment of entryways;
                          (vi)    the shadow patterns from massing and decorative features;
                          (vii) the siting and treatment of parking; and
                          (viii) the treatment of landscaping.

(b)   Context-Based Design Considerations and Findings

      In addition to the findings for Architectural Review contained in Section 18.76.020(d) of
      the Zoning Ordinance, the following additional findings are applicable in the CD district
      and subdistricts, as further illustrated on the accompanying diagrams:

(4)     Low-Density Residential Transitions
Where new projects are built abutting existing lower-scale residential development, care
shall be taken to respect the scale and privacy of neighboring properties through:

A. Transitions of development intensity
   from higher density development
   building types to building types that are
   compatible with the lower intensity
   surrounding uses (Figure 4-1 );



                                               (Figure 4-1)

B. Massing and orientation of buildings
   that respect and mirror the massing of
   neighboring structures by stepping back
   upper stories to transition to smaller
   scale buildings, including setbacks and
   daylight planes that match abutting R-1
   and R-2 zone requirements (Figure 4-

Private and public open space shall be provided so that it is usable for the residents,
visitors, and/or em lo ees of a site.
A. The type and design of the usable
    private open space shall be appropriate
    to the character of the building(s), and
    shall consider dimensions, solar access,
    wind protection, views, and privacy;

B. Open space should be sited and
   designed to accommodate different
   activities, groups, active and passive
   uses, and should be located convenient
   to the users (e.g., residents, employees,
   or public)
                                                (Figure 5-1)

     natural amenities of the site and its
     surroundings;

D. Usabie open space may be any
     combination of private and common
     spaces;

E. Usable open space does not need to be
     located on the ground and may be
     located in porches, decks, balconies
     and/or podiums (but not on rooftops)
     (Figure 5-1);

F. Open space should be located to
   activate the street fayade and increase
   "eyes on the street" when possible
   (Figure 5-1);

G.   Both private and common open space
     areas should be buffered from noise

(6)    Parking Design
Parking needs shall be accommodated but shall not be allowed to overwhelm the
character of the project or detract from the pedestrian environment, such that:

A. Parking is located behind buildings,
   below grade or, where those options are
                                                                                                        \\\~\\\\~\\

                                                                                                         r--m~-b
   low walls, etc.;
                                                                                                        j         .~

B. Structured parking is fronted or
   wrapped with habitable uses when
   possible (Figure 6-1 );                     P•rtdng podiums shall be &anted or wrapped with hibitable or actrve uses when
                                               po,.ible

                                              (Figure 6-1)
C. Parking that is semi-depressed is
   screened with architectural elements
   that enhance the streetscape such as
   stoops, balcony overhangs, and/or art;

D. Landscaping such as trees, shrubs,
   vines, or groundcover is incorporated
   into surface parking lots (Figure·6-2);




                                               Lanmcaping such as trees. slTubs. .,;,,.. or ground cover 1s incorporated into

061204 syn 0120176
E. F0t: properties with parking access from
   the rear of the site (such as a rear alley
   or driveway) landscaping shall provide
   a visual buffer between vehicle
   circulation areas and abutting properties
   (Figure 6-3);

F. Street parking is utilized for visitor or
   customer parking and is designed in a
   manner to enhance traffic calming;
                                                  LMld<Qj>ing sho'I fl"OY'dc a viSUill bull'er between ,,.Ndc ••cos and adjo<cnt properties.


G. For properties with parking accessed         (Figure 6-3)
   from the front, minimize the amount of
   frontage used for parking access, no
   more than 25% of the site frontage
   facing a street should be devoted to
   garage openings, carports, or
   open/surface parking (on sites with less
   than 100 feet of frontage, no more than
   25 feet);

H. Where two parking lots abut and it is
   possible for a curb cut and driveway to
   serve several properties, owners are
                                                When po<Sible. adjacent properties ""' strongly encouraged to shire drillew.lys

   and                                          (Figure 6-4)

I. Parking is accessed from side streets or
   alle when ossible.

(7)     Large (multi-acre) Sites
Large (in excess of one acre) sites shall be designed so that street, block, and building
patterns are consistent with those of the surrounding neighborhood, and such that:

A. New development oflarge sites
   maintains and enhances connectivity
   with a hierarchy of public streets,
   private streets, walks and bike paths                           ,,,..v

B. The diversity of building types
    increases with increased lot size (e.g.,   (Figure 7-1)
    <1 acre = minimum 1 building type; 1-
    2 acres =minimum 2 housing types;
    greater than 2 acres = minimum 3
    housing types) (Figures 7-1 through 7-
    3); and

C. Where a site includes more than one
   housing type, each building type should
   respond to its immediate context in
   terms of scale, massing, and design
   (e.g., Village Residential building types
   facing or abutting existing single-
   famil y residences) (Figures 7-2 and 7-
   3).

(8)     Sustainability and Green Building Design
Project design and materials to achieve sustainability and green building design should be
incorporated into the project. Green building design considers the environment during
design and construction. Green building design aims for compatibility with the local
environment: to protect, respect and benefit from it. In general, sustainable buildings are
energy efficient, water conserving, durable and nontoxic, with high-quality spaces and
high recycled content materials. The following considerations should be included in site
and building design:

A. Optimize building orientation for heat
   gain, shading, daylighting, and natural                                                  South <•oni windows with

18.18.120                Grandfathered Uses and Facilities
(a)    Grandfathered Uses
       (1)     The following uses and facilities may remain as grandfathered uses, and shall not
               require a conditional use permit or be subject to the provisions of Chapter 18.94:
               (A)   Any use which was being conducted on August 28, 1986; or
               (B)   A use not being conducted on August 28, 1986, if the use was temporarily
                     discontinued due to a vacancy of 6 months or less before August 28, 1986; or
               (C)   Any office use existing on April 16, 1990 on a property zoned CD and GF
                     combining, which also existed as a lawful conforming use prior to August 28,
                     1986, notwithstanding any intervening conforming use.
        (2)    The grandfathered uses in subsection (1) shall be permitted to remodel, improve, or
               replace site improvements on the same site, for continual use and occupancy by the
               same use, provided such remodeling, improvement, or replacement:
               (A)   shall not result in increased floor area;
               (B)   shall not shift the building footprint;
               (C)   shall not result in an increase of the height, length, building envelope, or any
                     other increase in the size of the improvement;
               (D)   shall not increase the degree of noncompliance, except pursuant to the
                     exceptions to floor area ratio regulations set forth in Section 18.18.070; or
               (E)   in the case of medical, professional, general business or administrative office
                     uses of a size exceeding 5,000 square feet in the CD-S or CD-N district that are
                     deemed grandfathered pursuant to subsection (1), such remodeling,
                     improvement, or replacement shall not result in increased floor area devoted to
                     such office uses.

061204 syn 0120176
       (3)     If a grandfathered use deemed existing pursuant to subsection ( 1) ceases and
               thereafter remains discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it shall be considered
               abandoned and may be replaced only by a conforming use.
       (4)     A use deemed grandfathered pursuant to subsection ( 1) which is changed to or
               replaced by a conforming use shall not be reestablished, and any portion of a site or
               any portion of a building, the use of which changes from a grandfathered use to a
               conforming use, shall not thereafter be used except to accommodate a conforming
               use.

(b)    Grandfathered Facilities
       (1)     Any noncomplying facility existing on August 28, 1986 and which, when built, was
               a complying facility, may remain as a grandfathered facility and shall not be subject
               to the provisions of Chapter 18.94.
       (2)     The grandfathered facilities specified in subsection (1) shall be permitted to remodel,
               improve, or replace site improvements on the same site, provided such remodeling,
               improvement, or replacement:
               (A)   shall not result in increased floor area;
               (B)   shall not shift the building foot print;
               (C)   shall not result in an increase of the height, length, building envelope, or any
                     other increase in the size of the improvement;
               (D)   shall not increase the degree of noncompliance, except pursuant to the
                     exceptions to floor area ratio regulations set forth in Section 18.18.070.


        SECTION 5. Section 18.94.070(b)(2)(E) (Nonconforming Use- Required Termination)
of Title 16 of the City of Palo Alto Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:
       "(E) The nonconforming uses of the property at 3200 Park Boulevard/340 Portage
       Avenue/Olive Avenue for retail, research and development, warehouse, and storage uses
       are permitted in approximately the same ratio of uses existing as of October 16, 2006,
       subject to the following limitations: (1) retail uses shall not exceed 60,000 square feet, and
       (2) truck deliveries and other noisy outdoor activities shall be limited to the hours of 8:00
       a.m. to 9:00 p.m. weekdays and 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. weekends.


       SECTION 6. Section 16.20.120(a) (Signs) of Title 16 of the City of Palo Alto Municipal
Code is amended to read as follows:

"16.20.120               Freestanding Signs

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, every freestanding sign shall comply with the
requirements of this section.



                                                     65
061204 syn 0120176
(a)    Freestanding signs over five feet.
       Freestanding signs over five feet in height shall be permitted only on nonresidential
       properties in the GM zones and on El Camino Real in the CN and CS zones and for service
       stations, restaurants and shopping centers elsewhere.
       (1)      Area and height. The maximum area and height of such signs is set forth in
       Table 2.
       (2)       Location. Every sign shall be wholly on the owner's property, except that for any
       site that encompasses a minimum often (10) acres in size and contains a minimum of
       50,000 square feet of retail square footage, but does not have its primary frontage on a
       freeway, expressway, or major arterial, a freestanding sign may be located offsite on
       private property with frontage on the nearest major arterial roadway. The sign size and
       height shall be governed by the criteria set forth in Table 2, using the average site length
       dimension as the lot frontage for calculation purposes, but in no case shall the sign size
       exceed fifty (50) square feet. The sign shall comply with all other regulations of this
       Chapter, the total site signage (including the offsite sign) shall not exceed the total allowed
       for the site, and all other signs on the offsite property must comply with sign regulations
       for that site.
       (3)       Number. Subject to the provisions of Section 16.20.170, therf( may be one such
       sign for each frontage and one additional sign for any portion of frontage in excess of two
       hundred fifty feet. The size of any additional sign shall be determined from Table 2 by
       counting as frontage that portion thereof which is in excess of two hundred fifty feet. In the
       case of shopping centers and other multiple occupancies having a common frontage, the
       frontage shall be deemed to be that of the shopping center or commonly used parcel and
       not the frontages of the individual businesses or occupancies.
       (4)       Construction. In addition to the requirements of Section 16.20.190, every such
       sign shall be constructed wholly of metal, incombustible plastic or other approved fire-
       resistant material."
