Title: First Quarter FY 2019 Financial Report

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Administrative Services

This is an information only report and no Council action is required.

Background
The purpose of this report is to provide the Council with information on the financial condition
of the City’s General Fund and Enterprise Funds as of the end of the first (1 st) quarter of fiscal
year (FY) 2019 (September 30, 2018).

Discussion
The FY 2019 1st quarter ended on September 30, 2018 and this report summarizes the actual
financial activity of the General and Enterprise Funds for the three-month period and compares
those amounts to the same period of the prior year and to the FY 2019 Adjusted Budget.

Attachment A provides a breakdown of revenues by source and expenses by function, with
separate columns for Adopted Budget and Adjusted Budget. The Adjusted Budget column
includes prior year commitments that were carried forward into this fiscal year and
amendments to the FY 2019 Adopted Budget through September 30. Encumbrances and actual
expenses for the three-month period are also reported.

General Fund revenues (excluding operating transfers and other sources) for the 1 st quarter FY
2019 total $23.9 million, which is 7 percent lower than the same period prior year, and
comprises 12 percent of the current year Adjusted Budget. Cash receipts declined in sales tax,
transient occupancy, permits & licenses and documentary transfer taxes over prior year’s 1 st
quarter. These lower levels are not indicative of the annual expected receipts in FY 2019, they
merely reflect a timing difference.

General Fund expenses for 1st quarter are 2 percent higher than prior year, and are tracking at
23 percent of Adjusted Budget which is similar to the prior year trend.

Property tax revenue in the 1st quarter of the fiscal year is typically only a nominal amount as
property tax receipts are paid by the County beginning in the month of November and then
again beginning in March. FY 2018 actual property tax revenue was $42.8 million. The FY 2019
budgeted amount is $45.3 million, 5.8 percent higher than the prior year’s actual revenue.

Sales tax revenue for the 1st quarter has decreased $117,000, or 6 percent, from the same
period last year. This doesn’t reflect actual economic performance this is discussed further in
the next paragraph. The outlook is the FY 2019 budget of $31.2 million will be met or exceeded.

In FY 2018, the newly established department of California Department of Tax and Fee
Administration (CDTFA) took over the responsibility of administrating the collection and
distribution of sales and use tax. CDTFA introduced new technology and collection and
distribution processes which, unfortunately, had issues leading to delays in processing and
distributing sales tax receipts. In addition, changes in the distribution methodology lead to
timing differences in FY 2019 Q1 compared to the prior year’s receipt.




City of Palo Alto                                                                                                        Page 2
Charges for services revenue is up $1.2 million, or 32 percent, from the same quarter last year.
This increase is due to a combination of the following items:
    • Paramedic service fees increased $156,000 over the same period last year due to
        increased paramedic fees.
    • Plan check fees for the quarter increased by $237,000, or 19% from prior year’s 1st
        quarter. 1st quarter revenue of $1.5 million represents 26 percent of the annual
        budgeted amount
    • Golf course related fees increased $693,000 from the prior year 1st quarter due to
        opening in May 2018. Actual revenue for the 1st quarter of $771,000 represents 21
        percent of the full year budgeted amount of $3.7million.

Transient occupancy tax (TOT) revenue cash receipts for the 1st quarter decreased $1.1 million
or 27 percent due to timing of collections. During this period, average daily room rates and
occupancy were $277 per day and 84.3 percent which is 4.5 percent and 3.2 percent higher
over the prior year, respectively. Based on the current trend, the expectation is that actual
receipts may exceed the adopted budget of $25.1 million. This revenue stream will continue to
be monitored and adjustments will be brought forward as appropriate.

Documentary transfer tax cash receipts total $1.4 million, or 19 percent of the FY 2019
budgeted amount, and are $0.1 million lower than prior year receipts for the same period. This
revenue source is volatile since it is highly dependent on sales volume and the mix of
commercial and residential sales.

Permits and licenses revenue is down primarily due to a decrease in new construction permit
revenue mainly for the $1.4 million permits issued to Channing House and Leland Stanford Jr.
University Board of Trustee from the same period last year.

Expense Highlights for 1st Quarter FY 2019
Following is a table which highlights the City’s expenses by function for the 1 st quarter,
compared to 1st quarter of the prior year. Each quarter’s expense is expressed as a percentage
of the Adjusted Budget for each year.

Police overtime is 15 percent higher from prior year due to overtime in the dispatch center
because of staff vacancies, more special events held in the city, and more cases handled in the
investigation unit. On a combined basis, salaries and overtime are at 24% of budget through
the 1st quarter of the fiscal year. The Department’s overtime analysis is included in Attachment
B.

Fire overtime is 6 percent lower than FY 2018 primarily due to fewer crews out on strike teams
for the first quarter in FY 2019. On a combined basis, salaries and overtime are 24% of the
budget through the 1st quarter of the fiscal year. The Department’s overtime analysis is
included in Attachment B.

New labor contracts were recently approved for all public safety groups however, actual activity
associated with these contracts is only reflected in the Police Department. Fire Department
implications will not reflect in actual activity until the second quarter of the fiscal year due to
the implementation timing of the labor contract.

General Fund Budget Stabilization Reserve (BSR) Balance
As reported to the Finance Committee on December 4, FY 2018 ended with a surplus of $11.5
million when compared to the FY 2019 Adopted Budget and a BSR balance of $52.8 million.
However, over 90 percent of the surplus is already approved to be used. After deducting the
2019 General Adopted Budget and subsequent budget amendments to the reserve through


City of Palo Alto                                                                                  Page 5
Council approved actions, the BSR balance is $42.3 million which is 20.1% of FY2019
expenditures and operating transfers adopted budget. The Finance Committee approved a
recommended $2.0 million reduction in the BSR to transfer funds from the BSR to the
Infrastructure Reserve; this would bring the BSR to $40.3 million or approximately 19 percent of
the FY 2019 Adopted Budget expenses. A more updated status of the BSR can be found in the
FY 2019 Mid-Year Budget Review, this report only reflects activities through the first quarter of
FY 2019.

Electric Fund 1st quarter improved $4.3 million from prior year due to lower Utility purchase
costs. Costs were lower than expected, mainly due to credits stemming from outages during
the Carr fire and other credits offset base resource costs. In addition, Western Area Power
Administration (WAPA) ceased restoration fund bills in Q1 of FY19. WAPA restoration fund is
one of the funding sources for the Central Valley Projects (CVP). The CVP restoration costs
were lower than anticipated due to over-collection from power customers and increases in
displacement program benefits.

Wastewater Collection Fund increased $0.5 million from prior year due to an 11% rate increase
effective July 1, 2018.



City of Palo Alto                                                                          Page 6
Wastewater Treatment Fund increased $0.7 million from prior year due to higher sewage
treatment costs, operating and capital costs resulting to higher partner’s billing.

Pension Update
Following is a table which shows the employee count in each of the Miscellaneous and Safety
Plans as of December 2018. As of that date, 46% of the City’s full-time employees were
