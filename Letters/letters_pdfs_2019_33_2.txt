Members of the City Council,

I certainly hope that the upgrades will improve the audibility of Council and Commission members as they speak.
As is, council and commission members may be able to hear each other but many are inaudible to the audience a good deal of
the time.

Subject:            In support of the President Hotel tenants


Dear Mayor Kniss and Council Members,

Palo Alto Forward writes in support of the President Hotel tenants.

We encourage the council to extend the stay of the current tenants as requested in the letter dated
December 20, 2018 from Iqbal Serang and Dennis Backlund.

There is a strong case in support of their request for at least four reasons:

1) It will follow through on the city's policy of having one year leases.

2) The city has yet to decide on the legal merits of the property owner's request for a use change and
even following a decision there may be appeals and legal actions delaying any change in use.

3) Even if a change is use is allowed, extra time will be needed to get the required permits and go through
the project review process.

There seems little if any cost or inconvenience to the property owner from allowing the tenants to remain
through at least June and preferably until the property owner is ready to make any changes on the
property.

4) As council members know, the housing market in this area is very tight and the extra time will be a
compassionate gesture to a fine group of residents while the city and property owner sort out how things
will proceed.

On a different but related issue, Palo Alto Forward encourages the council and PTC to hold a study session
on the recently approved CASA compact. It includes a wealth of information that can inform our housing
work plan going forward and also includes many ideas for renter protections.

       Steven Feinstein
       Ionic Materials Corp.

       Mr. Feinstein‐ Last night "DW Tomorrow Today" ran a piece on Ch 32‐1 in Fresno about a big lithium deposit in a
tapped‐out tin‐tungsten mine near the Czech‐German border in the town of Cinovec. I wrote as fast as I could, but they
flash things by fast. After some serious searching, I found this. I think it might be of interest to you at Ionic Materials: It is
four different pieces:


       https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dw+tomorrow+today+lithium+deposit+in+czech+bartaud

         Here are the notes I took last night. Lithium mica is what they produce, or will produce by mid 2021.

           The ore is zimbolite. They think the deposit is 250,000 tons of metallic lithium.

          They have developed a new process to extract the Li from the zimbolite.

            The price of Li has doubled in the past 18 months.

                                                                2
          The price is now $22,000 per ton in China. Per ton of what is not clear to me‐ pure Li?.

          The ore is crushed. The zimbolite is removed using magnets. They then use CO2 and H2O in a leaching
process. Lithium carbonate is left, a white substance. This is a simple process, a big advantage of it, and the same
process can be used to extract Li from old batteries. They talked about "more than a million tons of Li carbonate".

          You see an interview in the link above done Oct. 5, 2017 with Keith Coughlan, managing director of European
Metals Holdings Limited (LON‐EMH). He talks about production by his company beginning in Cinovec in mid 2021. He
says that electric vehicles will really be coming on by 2025, especially in Europe. "Czech government gives stamp of
approval" for the project says the title of the interview. Mr. Coughlan is an Australian, no strangers to mining. He
mentioned that Li is a strategic metal, as is tin, which they will produce as a by‐product.

         One of the comments after one of the four pieces in the above link says that B.C. had several Li mines, but they
were abandoned some years ago. He says that the ore in those British Columbia mines allows the Li to be extracted
easily compared to Li‐bearing ores found elsewhere.

        I could not find the actual piece on the DW Tomorrow Today website that was run here last night, Dec. 31, 2018
on Ch. 32‐1. It might be worth your while to try to see it if you have to contact DW TT to do so. I found the link I provide
above using this search term on YouTube: DW tomorrow today lithium deposit in Czech Bartaud. They showed a man
at some institute named Bartaud or Bartau discussing the process they have developed to extract the Li. If you could
learn the details of that process from him it might be very useful‐valuable.

        I saw a piece the o. day saying that a lot of Li is produced now in Africa using children as young as 12 working 12
hours per day in Li mines, a real problem. They said that that is going to be a real problem for producers of Li batteries. It
also said that Li can be extracted from the sea bed, but countries are protective of their sea beds.

      Hope you all find this helpful.

      L. William Harding
      Fresno

        One of the four pieces above shows people speaking Czech. My German is better than my Czech, and my
German is pretty rough. You might have a Czech speaker look at that.

      I hope that the media, et. al. to which I send this forward it to the U.S. DOE, to Congress, WH, DOD, GM, etc.

Subject:             issue to consider - office use of retail space (290 California Ave and more)


Dear City Council and Planning Department/Code Enforcement,

With the highly valuable office space here, I urge the City Council to prioritize protecting retail space from office
takeover. I've been paying attention because I care about civic/public space for our neighborhood and I've been
working on renting space in Palo Alto for a community‐building concept and so I pay close attention and inquire
wherever space is available.

This one I just discovered was a new level of concern . I"ve submitted it to 311, but I wanted you to be aware at a policy
level.

OFFICE USE TAKEOVER OF RETAIL SPACE
former Keeble & Shuckat space at 2980 California Ave.
This space briefly housed Accent Arts, and when they closed, it was vacant for awhile. Blossom Birth has taken over the
corner, and both sides are in violation.

290 California Ave, Suite C
Rented by Plume since January 2018 (or before). Supposed to be for their tech product. Nothing in there for whole
year except table and chairs (office‐type use).




                                                             1
290 California Ave, Suite B ‐ I discovered this Dec. 24, 2018
Now, a much larger space to the right (Suite B), where Accent Arts was, has a wall built so that Plume's offices are in
most of the space. They are supposed to offer a retail product in the small remaining area. This is a way many tech
companies could take over retail spaces and price out those of us who want to operate here. You can see a 'wall and
door" has been built that allowed for their office to take over most of this retail space.




                                                            2
3
Losing retail is a huge huge loss. We have other issues to work out on Cal Ave (parking requirements for uses which
incentivizes gyms, for instance), but at the very least let's protect retail from tech.

It's simply not true that these landlords cannot find tenants. I know because I've inquired about many vacant spaces
and the landlords are unwilling to lower the rent to find a tenant. They want to make the money office tenants give
them.

There are other examples (esp. around College Ave/Staunton, a few downtown), but to do this on a main business
district is particularly bold.

Please do what you can
1) to address this violation and prevent other tech takeovers of retail space
2) to direct code enforcement to prioritize protection of retail zoning violations over personal house zoning violations
(which have less of an impact on the whole community).
3) take policy steps if needed.

Please do not share my name with the landlord.

Warmly




So my hope is that this space gets rectified, and that the City Council (and whoever else needs to be involved) does
whatever you can to prioritize the protection of retail areas in Palo Alto.

Dear Mr. Korn,

This proposal has only gone through the Architectural Review Board, it may come to Council for
further public hearings and final decision. Federal law does supersede local law, however, local
jurisdictions can chose to enforce what remaining controls we have remaining. Palo Alto officials and
its staff can enforce the existing law rather than amend it to conform or to make it easier.

BTW, there is an email address that reaches all the Council Members as well as some key staff

Thank you for your email and Happy New Year.

Subject: Palo Alto pushes back against Verizon proposals

Palo Alto pushes back against Verizon proposals
Palo Alto officials are pushing back against proposed designs for new wireless-antenna equipment and
considering a challenge to recently adopted federal rules that will make it easier for telecommunication
companies to receive approvals. Wednesday, 1:31 PM | 5 comments


Dear Palo Alto Council Members,

i saw this article in Palo Alto online. One paragraph surprised me:

The rash of proposals has created a tricky quandary for Palo Alto officials, who are
trying to balance the cityʹs demand for data with its desire to preserve neighborhood
aesthetics. At the same time, local officials are navigating through a ʺhighly litigated and
regulated area,ʺ in the words of Architectural Review Board Chair Wynne Furth. Federal
laws prohibit local jurisdictions from considering the health effects of new wireless
equipment or from taking too long to review the proposals.

Does the Federal government have the authority to prohibit local jurisdictions from
considering the health effects about anything? Could the Feds for example have a law
prohibiting people from suing a restaurant over a food poisoning outbreak?

I have heard about this exemption but never seen it so vividly portrayed as in this article.

I took a libertarian economics course at Harvard, and the instructor said that the power of
consumers to bring tort lawsuits against companies is the best way to ensure the safety of
their products and far superior to general governmental regulation. But this exemption
undermines that very principle does it not?

See also this article.

Happy New Year to you all!
Michael

Excellency Mrs. Liz Kniss.

I am Spanish and I currently live in the north of Chile.
My name is Javier Miranda.
I am writing to you because I have applied for a job in the city of Palo Alto, which is about filling the heavy
machinery operator position to dedicate the work to public works in the city, and that is why I am writing to
you, so that in some way it helps me to be selected and that way I can travel to Palo Alto to live and work
honestly.
However, I would like you, from the town hall, to help me in the referral to documentation so that my transfer
to Palo Alto is possible. I want to do things well so as not to cause problems with anyone. I've always been like
this.

Thankful for your time and for everything that you could communicate to me.
Greetings and see you soon.
