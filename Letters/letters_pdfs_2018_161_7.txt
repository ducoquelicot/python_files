Title: Informational Report on the City of Palo Alto's Cubberley Artist Studio
Program

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Community Services

Recommendation
This report is informational only and no action is required.

Executive Summary
The last informational update to Council on the status of the program took place in
2015. This CMR corresponds to the recent round of artist selection for the 2018-2022
term, and reports on achievements and accomplishments over the last four years.
The Arts and Sciences Division recently completed the 2018 artist selection process for
the Cubberley Artist Studio Program (CASP) for 2018-2022. Out of 48 applicants (46
applications from individual artists and 2 applications from two-person collectives), 16
incumbent artists in residence applied for their second term; 6 new artists were
approved to fill available studios, 13 new artists were put on the CASP waitlist, and 13
artists were not approved.

In the last four years, CASP artists have made significant contributions to their field as
well as provided more than 220 free public programs on the arts to benefit the
community. For example, CASP was invited to show as a creative community in two
San Francisco gallery exhibitions, and artist team t.w.five was awarded prestigious
residencies at the de Young Museum and the Headlands Center for the Arts. This
report summarizes significant awards, exhibitions, additional residencies, as well as
CASP outreach to the community in the form of open studios, exhibitions,
presentations, lectures and arts events.

Background
Originally founded in 1990, Cubberley Artist Studio Program (CASP), housed at the
Cubberley Community Center, was established to provide subsidized studio space to
Palo Alto and regional artists, for whom acceptance as artists in residence in this juried


City of Palo Alto                                                                     Page 1
program would make a significant impact on their careers. Between the years 1990 –
2014, a total of 61 local artists were juried into the studio program with residence terms
ranging from 4 to 24 years.

In 2014, the City, under the leadership of the Arts and Sciences Division and with
community input and Council approval, revamped the program in order to reach a wider
range of artists in various stages of their careers, and working in a wide array of media
and approaches, from traditional fine arts to innovative mixed media, performance and
social practice.

At that time, the program also instituted term limits of up to two 4-year terms, in order
to ensure equitability and accessibility to all artists in need of affordable studio space in
a community environment. Staff implemented a gradual phase-out program in 2014,
allowing the eleven incumbent artists who re-applied to remain with CASP for an
additional 1-4 years into the 2014-18 term. The updated policy indicates the primary
use of the studio must still be focused on the creation of new art work. While artists
may sell their work from their studio or offer occasional classes or workshops in their
studio, the focus must be on the creation of non-commercial, original work by the juried
artists. Artists in residence must also meet community service requirements, intended
to support and build the outreach component of the program. Toward this goal, a
former studio was turned into the ArtLab, a free public programming space for artists to
organize exhibitions, workshops, panels, etc. At that time, a small studio was also set
aside for short-term residencies (up to 4 months) in order to support emerging and
visiting artists, as well as intermittently practicing artists who seek to commit to art
practice on a full-time basis, and artists or artist teams in need of short-term space for
a special project.

Discussion
Today, CASP is a dynamic and highly competitive program that consists of:
    22 individual and shared studios, currently housing 23 artists;
    ArtLab, a space dedicated for community engagement programming and
      exhibition opportunities;
    Rotating Artist Studio, a designated studio space for short-term studio rental
      opportunities to support emerging, visiting artists, and intermittently practicing
      artists in need of short-term space;
    Paula Kirkeby Press, a fine art printmaking studio that hosts classes for all
      levels and a drop-in program for experienced printmakers, operated by the Palo
      Alto Art Center. (Began Summer 2017).

CASP Mission
The Cubberley Artist Studio Program (CASP) supports the vitality of the arts in Palo Alto
by providing City-sponsored, affordable studio space for artists, building creative
community and fostering public engagement with the arts and artists.

    the prior twenty-four years. Staff projects that by the end of the 2018-2022 term,
    an additional 20 artists will be served, meaning that in the eight years between 2014
    – 2022, the program will have exceeded the number of artists served in the prior
    twenty-four years.

CASP Artists’ Achievement and Highlights CASP exists to support artists in the
creation of new work. Accordingly, the benefit of working in a creative community is
the tangible and intangible inspiration that artists tap into to further their own creative
pursuits. Residency at CASP provides a significant impact on artistic careers and
professional development of all participating artists. The complete listing of their
diversity of artistic discipline, stage of career, and residency can be found in Attachment
B: CASP Residencies 2014-18.

In addition to these individual achievements which build momentum and prestige for
the program, CASP is strengthened by the proximity of the MakeX studio, which many
artists access from time to time for their own work. CASP has expanded its
programming in the last year with the advent of the Paula Kirkeby Press.

The Paula Kirkeby Press is a new printmaking studio which was made possible thanks to
a generous gift from the Kirkeby family. Paula Kirkeby, who passed away in 2016, had
deep connections to Palo Alto and the printmaking community: a consultant, art dealer,
community volunteer, and owner and operator of Smith Andersen Editions, Kirkeby,
made a significant impact on the art world and the Bay Area art community. Kirkeby
also served on the Palo Alto Public Art Commission and contributed and facilitated the
contribution of more than 30 works of art to the Art in Public Places Collection of the
City of Palo Alto.

Since the Press opened at Cubberley during the summer of 2017, the Palo Alto Art
Center has held 9 adult classes and workshops at Paula Kirkeby Press, serving 45
students. There was also a Children’s Fine Art teacher professional development
monotype workshop serving nine of the Art Center’s teaching artists in that program.
There are seven active volunteers, and 30 artists approved for the Press’ drop-in
program. That program has a robust schedule, offering 54 drop-in opportunities since
August of 2017.

CASP Community Service Achievements and Highlights
As a community that offers free arts programming, the larger community also receives
benefits from the program. Beginning in 2014, CASP includes a Community Service
requirement for all artists in residence. CASP artists are expected to actively contribute
to the strengthening of CASP by creating or participating in diverse and high-caliber
arts-oriented, community engagement events and activities. The majority of these
programs are offered in the CASP ArtLab, a former art studio turned into a
programming space for CASP.

Through Community Service programming, CASP artists have made a positive and
unique impact on the communities in Palo Alto and beyond by delivering an
unparalleled high-quality artistic and educational programs and services, all free of

charge and accessible to all. CASP artists have produced stellar arts programs of public
benefit, free of charge and accessible to all members of the public.

Since 2014, CASP artists hosted 96 public-engagement programs and events (See
Attachment C: CASP Community Service 2015-2018). Some of the programs curated by
CASP artists and hosted in the ArtLab and beyond are:

CASP Artists’ Impact Statements


City of Palo Alto                                                                     Page 7
Staff finds that the artists in residence at the City of Palo Alto’s Cubberley Artist Studio
Program view their experience as invaluable in terms of the impact on their creative
growth, the partnerships and friendships they develop within CASP, and the personal
meaning of the space in their lives. Here is a sample of statements by CASP artists in
their annual reports from 2017:

“I enjoy being in a community of artists and I greatly benefit from the interactions and
comradery of other professional artists. My artwork grows through the impromptu
critiques, advice and ideas shared by the other artists in the program.” - Linda Gass

“CASP is crucial to my development as an artist in that I have a space to experiment,
organize, and create new innovative works on paper. CASP Artists are not just
colleagues, they are my dearest friends. Without Barbara, Pantea, and Marianne, I
would not have the support system I need to develop as an artist. They give candid
advice towards my work…. As someone who treasures my network of artists, I
continuously give digital literacy advice to other CASP artist to aid them in website
creation, photo editing, and web etiquette.” - Charles Coates

“I am in my studio many times a week now, and notice the results in my art work and
contributions to the community have been significantly different. I think the community
motivates me to have a larger presence as a cultural figure in the Bay Area.” - Amy
DiPlacido

“Being part of a community of serious and accomplished artists has contributed to the
development of my work and art practice. For example, when I was struggling to
complete a new work that was on deadline for a museum exhibition, two CASP artists
generously gave me a one-hour critique that helped me find my way. It was my
pleasure this summer to bring a CASP artist into a 2-person show at a San Francisco
commercial gallery. I find that most CASP artists are happy to share professional
information and support their colleagues. I am proud to list the CASP residency on my
resume and exhibition proposals.” - Marianne Lettieri


Resource Impact
The current rental rates for Cubberley Studios are $ 0.89/square foot for Palo Alto
residents and $0.99/square foot for non-residents. The rotating artist studio rents for
$75/week. In FY 2018, the CASP lease revenue is on target to generate $132,500 and
the one rental studio generates ap. $3,600 per year for the COPA, totaling $136,100 for
FY2018.

The CASP program operates at no cost to the City other than CSD staff time to oversee
the program and facility, plus additional support from Real Estate and Facilities. Wi-Fi
expansion at the Cubberley campus, expected to be completed in September, 2018, will


City of Palo Alto                                                                       Page 8
positively benefit the artists in residence. CASP would benefit from a small, dedicated
operational budget of $5,000 per year for supplies and materials. Policy Implications
The CASP program is aligned with the following Comprehensive Plan Policies:
Policy C-1.4 – Promote City parks, open spaces, recreational facilities, libraries, classes
and cultural activities for community members recognizing that these facilities and
services build and strengthen community.
Policy C-4.5 – Expand the space available in the community for art exhibits, classes and
other cultural activities, studios and galleries and other activities made possible by
technical innovation, while maintaining and enhancing natural areas. Program C4.5.1 –
Use Cubberley Community Center as a critical and vital part of the City’s service delivery
system while also planning for its future.
Policy C-5.2- Promote access to programs that enhance and increase the physical and
mental health, well-being, recreation, safety and cultural opportunities of all residents
and visitors.
