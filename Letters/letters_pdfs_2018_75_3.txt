Honorable City Council Members,

At the October 1 Council meeting pre-screening of a potential permit request for the property at 980
Middlefield, the former Roller, Hapgood, and Tinney Mortuary, comments were made by some Council
members that were very painful and insulting for me. My brother was killed at age 25 by a drunk driver
who ran a red light at University and Middlefield. His body was taken to this funeral home where my
Mother and I went to identify him. My son, who died at age 21, was buried from this funeral home. The
Mortuary provided much needed support at those times. Some of the Council’s comments made light of
services provided for the grieving by that facility. These were deeply hurtful.

Beyond that I have lived in this neighborhood for over 40 years. Mortuary services rarely used street
parking. When the street was used it was for a short time in the middle of the day. The funeral home also
allowed parking on their property for Addison School parents dropping off or picking up their children. This
parking opportunity is no longer allowed by the new owner. In addition parking in this neighborhood has
gone from difficult to almost impossible. The presence of a bike lane prohibits parking on one side of
Addison Ave. The current RPP program limits parking to two hours without a permit. The neighborhood is
densely populated. It consists of single family homes, duplexes, apartment buildings, and condominiums.
It was never designed for the number of cars current lifestyle uses.

The implication at the October 1 Council meeting was that families where both parents work is a new
phenomenon. In this town the need for duel incomes is not new at all. I was a “working mom” while
raising 4 children in the mid 1970’s on. Almost every woman I knew worked either as an entrepreneur or
an employee of a business or service in the South Bay. Childcare needs while working is not a new issue
nor does it differ from when I and my friends were raising our children in this neighborhood and this town.

Currently the City of Palo Alto offers families the Children’s Theatre, the Children’s Library, and the
Children’s Museum (under improvement). In town we also have Parent’s Place, Palo Alto Community
Child Care, Children’s Health Council, Family and Children’s Services, Parca Children’s Services, Hand in
Hand, Pre-School Family, YMCA, Abilities United, Parent’s Club of Palo Alto-Menlo Park, and Worklife
Office Stanford University. There is not a dearth of services in Palo Alto for working parents.

The proposal put forward is for a private club not a public service. The club would provide work space,
childcare, classes and parties often for charges beyond the membership fees. It would employ
approximately 28. Per the applicants statement it would hold numerous events for up to 400 people both
day and night 7 days a week. The applicant stated there would be 250 events per year for up to 75
attendees and 150 events per year for 75 to 400 attendees. That is 400 private events per year. Also
indicated were a total of 28 gatherings offered for free or low cost for non-profits or charities. This is
extremely high usage for a facility located in an already densely populated residential neighborhood.

Currently the applicant holds large private parties at her home located one block from the property at 980
Middlefield. Delivery trucks double park on Addison Ave. for up to 3 consecutive days in order to prepare
for and clean up after these events. Several other activities have occurred that have closed down the
street for a full day making it impossible for residents to get to their own homes. Moving these types of
activities one block away and across the street from Addison school while at the same time greatly
increasing the number of events to 400 or more per year is not acceptable use of neighborhood property.

In my view this is an application for a carte blanche permit for any and all activities on a private property
at a private club. This is not a proposal for a community service available for the benefit of the residents of
Palo Alto. This private club will be a detriment to the surrounding neighborhood. Another location for this
facility should be found.

Subject:              AMI (smart meters) goes to Finance -- 10-16-18


Council members,

On 10-16-18, the Finance Committee will consider an item about smart meters.

I stand by my previous comments from 05-01-18, 05-09-18, and 09-02-18 (cited below the "###" line, in case you want to
reread them).

Here are some remaining issues:

* The plan's financial analysis "breaks even" only if it includes the predicted savings due to customers conserving
more because of information they get from smart meters. But how do we know that's why customers conserved more?

* The plan refuses to consider any way of connecting the smart meters that can't be ready by 2020. Why do we
need the network by then? If the City had a citywide municipal FTTP network by the time smart meters were needed, I
think it would play a role in connecting the smart meters.

* The plan is thinking about relying on one of the incumbent wireless carriers (e.g., AT&T or Verizon) for smart meter
connections. But from time to time, there are reports of major outages.
https://www.seattletimes.com/business/regions-cell-networks-disrupted-after-presidential-text-alert/
https://www.phonearena.com/news/Verizon-outage-affecting-much-of-
U.S._id109230?mc_cid=fd6f586d63&mc_eid=99443c82f8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIg82AmC_Vc
Shouldn't our utilities be in control of the reliability and resiliency of these connections? When the electric power goes out,
some of the incumbent carriers' access points don't even have battery backup. How much would this connection
service cost, both now and in the future?

* The plan seems to say that the electric smart meters won't have battery backup either, only enough power for one "last-
gasp" message when the electric power goes out. Is that what we want?

* Staff has said that there's no point in considering the details of customers' options for opting out of smart meters until
after Council approves of going ahead with smart meters. But why wouldn't Council want to know more about the opt-out
options before going ahead?

Thanks.

See below.

Of course, this isn't ALL of the overflights ‐ I wasn't home all day and didn't record everything.
Notice 8 flights just before midnight! Why do we have to put up with this??

Is the city council doing anything about this?
If not, do you have any suggestions as to what individuals can do?

The FAA was supposed to move the SERFR route back to the BSR ground track in August. That has not been done. And I
can find no info about the status of this move. Do you have any info?

Thank you
Jim Holmlund

PS. Note that the items below with no Flight represent flights that are too close together to decide which to
report. Thus, each blank
represents one or maybe two flights.
==============================================================================================

All of these complaints have already been auto‐submitted to SFO, so please do not forward this email to sfo.noise ‐ they
already have them all !

Subject:             ARB Rejects 429 University Plan for Third and Final Time


Dear City Council Members,
Today the ARB voted 2‐1 to again reject the proposed plans for 429 University Ave. This is the third rejection in a row
since the City Council Motion (2‐6‐17) which gave the Applicant an opportunity to develop an appropriately designed
building. The Applicant's first year timeline expired, and the Planning Department graciously extended the period by
one year. The Applicant did not present her first set of plans to the ARB until 18 months after your motion. She was
allowed two ARB hearings, but the ARB also graciously granted her a third due to slow progress. Her clock has now run
out. The Planning Department Director, Jonathan Lait, is now required to deliver to City Council a report in writing with
his recommendations. City Council will have the final say regarding this proposed development, and I urge you to
officially deny it. The proposed development is in appropriate for the following reasons:

       Massing and scale is not appropriate for this site; one story existing buildings immediately adjacent to a four
        story cement building
       The design and materials are not harmonious with surrounding buildings and architecture
       It lacks the mandated design linkages
       The HRB unanimously denied this proposal. It will destroy existing Birge Clark buildings and leave a poorly
        designed building in its place
       The building is not pedestrian friendly. It has no shelter, overhangs, or alcoves.
       It inhibits pedestrian and commercial use of alleyway by turning it into a major garage entrance




As one prominent ARB member astutely stated today, "this building is not helping the city's design." Thank you for your
continued devotion to the city's appropriate development and respect for its architectural heritage.

Sincerely,
Michael Harbour, MD, MPH
Neighbor

Subject:             Concerning single use / disposables in the eateries


Dear City Council

A majority of restaurants and cafes in Palo Alto offer food only in single use, disposable utensils. The single use items
incur heavy energy cost and carbon footprint, both of which can be easily avoided by choosing reusable
alternatives. Some of these items cannot be recycled and make it straight to the landfill. In order to mitigate the
adverse impact on environment, is it possible for the city to mandate that reusable utensils be provided for all food
items sold within the city and the use of disposables be limited to "to‐go" orders? This might incur additional cost but
the impact can be minimized through policy incentives. Moreover, large businesses like Starbucks, shouldn't be
impacted significantly. It seems the environmental benefits are worth the economic cost in this matter.

If such efforts are already underway, I would be glad to have some information.

Thank you,
Asim

Palo Alto City Council

City of Palo Alto

Palo Alto, CA 94301



Elected Council Members:

 The Office of the City Clerk has done a fairly good job providing a set of user interfaces that allow candidates in
local elections to report financial contributions on-line, reducing the work required to comply with various campaign
finance reporting obligations. Although these interfaces link to web-sites of various government and commercials
servers, using centralized processing makes sense and reduces the cost to the City.

Would like to complement the City Clerk for doing what needed to be done for a city located in the Silicon Valley.

 There is one issue that needs more work, however. The FPPC Forms are still being posted as .PDF files—which
makes the data not easily introduced into a spreadsheet, or other data management system. Without using a data
analysis tool, a decent analysis of this data can not be accomplished without rekeying the data.

 One of the local media outlets has done this rekeying, offering this data to its readers via Google.docs. While this
makes the data accessible immediately for analysis—the question as to why the City can not make this data
available still needs to be asked. Additionally, this data should be archived for future analysis—which can not be
expected of commercial operations, such as a newspaper.

 This is a request for the Council to suggest that the City Clerk begin making all FPPC forms available in a format
that can be used by a spreadsheet and/or database manager, as well as archive them in perpetuity.

        To all‐

      The complete "Dark Money" POV will run tonight, Wed. Oct. 3, 2018, at 5:30 and at 9 PM on Ch. 18‐4 in Fresno. I
strongly recommend it, unless, of course, you are convinced that our political system is clean and honest, and that
special interests have only very limited influence on our elections.

        I won't say that this is a second "shot heard round the world", (that should have been the first shots that LBJ
caused to be fired in Viet Nam), but this is an eye‐opener.

       Recipients living outside of the Central Valley should look for Dark Money on PBS. I can't believe it will only be
run once between now and November. Or even pay to see it on YouTube.

     Doug‐ We've been naïve. Watch this to see how dark money now works in politics. Our country is nearly lost.

       This is a trailer:

      http://www.pbs.org/pov/darkmoney/video/what‐is‐dark‐money‐dark‐money‐‐/

      Here's another trailer:

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4OGlW1JJpc&list=PL3ODbKmHhkJ8abbJpVveL_qD00g_mFoM5

       I don't seem to find the full program on YouTube. It is very worthwhile seeing, especially if you think we have an
honest political system.

      Citizens United decision by the Sup. Ct. had a lot to do with this, apparently. I didn't go to Viet Nam. If they tried
to murder me now in such a deal, I'd REALLY resist.

        I rarely watch these POVs. Usually about inner city downtrodden wondering how they got that way. But I
stumbled into this one, and it is interesting. If you thought Montana must be pure and clean, this will change your mind.
I sure get the big glossy brochures from the candidates. Full of lies and distortions, as are their tv ads. Solution, probably

move to Deutschland. We can believe nothing we hear from those in government or those trying to get elected to it.
Down through history, that has often provoked a strong reaction from the governed when it goes on long enough.
                                                                                                                                 2

                     you read this email.


I'm tariq asani and I was visiting for a few days the Palo Alto downtown area and I'll say this your town is the most racist
and rude place I've seen in a very long time. Made me think I was in the south in the 60's. If you haven't guessed I'm a
African American male, I did get to meet one gentleman another African American the other evening and I asked him
are the residents here always this rude after some conversation back and forth he informed me it gets worse. And it did
at your Caltrain station some Rn's awaiting a bus spoke amongst themselves he can go around us and one of them was a
African American. The gentleman man I met was my tour guide of sorts for that afternoon. I reside in North Scottsdale
Arizona and was in the area with my son whom was going to attend Stanford but had a change of heart with what we
witnessed. If your town has racial diversity classes i implore you to implement it now unless this is the norm here.
The gentleman i talked with was educated had 2 jobs but was homeless staying in one of your local churches through
one of the various programs ( I can't remember the organization ) but if this what he has to deal with on a daily basis it'll
be a dam near impossible with the stereotyping I witnessed. I witnessed quite a few homeless people but this
gentleman wasn't on drugs or inebriated nor did he ask me for any money.

You do have a beautiful town with some very ugly people in it that need to come off there high horse Palo Alto is a far
cry from Scottsdale az or Bellevue wa and I we will not be returning after what we endured in our 3day stay here. Thank
you for your time in reading this email and in the near future all those who had there noses turnt up when I asked for
simple directions and the group of Rn's at your bus station whom wouldn't clear a path for us to walk by shows what
culture you have here a d it's close to Stanford. They need to go find the gentleman who took time out of his schedule
to guide us to our destination that was homeless and never asked us for anything and showed more compassion than
your towns residents.
Please excuse my spelling I'm using my phone to send this email.

Subject:             Multiple monthly accidents at Middlefield and Lincoln


Honorable City Council Members and Public Works Engineering Department:

It is 9:20 am on Wednesday morning and we have just had our umpteenth accident at the corner of Middlefield and
Lincoln. This intersection began to see an uptick in fender benders about three years ago, and the frequency is only
increasing. Cars are moving at top speed on Middlefield and it has become dangerous for cross traffic. Visibility is poor
and the notorious dip on the west side of Lincoln only makes things worse. Cars have been hit so hard that they are
pushed up over the sidewalk and into the front yard of houses on the corners. I no longer consider it safe to drive across
Middlefield at this intersection, instead, I go up to the light at Addison and Middlefield.

Some kind of relief, beyond the caution signs on Lincoln, and the no parking barriers on Middlefield (two of which were
crushed in this morning's accident) is absolutely essential here. We are all incredibly lucky that no serious injury accident
has happened here. All of the potential exists for a car occupant or a pedestrian to be badly hurt or even killed. This is an
unacceptable risk and I urge you to give priority to accident prevention measures here. A possible solution would be
making Lincoln right‐turn‐only in both directions at this intersection. In any case, the likelihood of an injury accident
occurring here demands immediate attention to come up with a safer traffic situation.

Thank you for your time and attention,

Lucinda Abbott

Subject:               Proposal for 429 University Ave Fails to Meet City Council Motion


Dear ARB Members,
You have been asked to provide final feedback for the proposal at 429 University Ave. This is an important corner at
Kipling St. which consists of existing Birge Clark Buildings. Kipling St. is the most narrow street in downtown Palo Alto,
almost one half the width of Bryant or Waverly. It cannot accommodate a mammoth 4 story structure as proposed. It
is also located on a pedestrian‐friendly alleyway with existing businesses that open onto the alleyway, and this building
destroys that ambience. It is imperative that the ARB help approve a building that is appropriate in size, scale, mass, and
transition from the perspective of all sides of the building.

As you know, this project was appealed, and the City Council passed a Motion on February 6, 2017. The Motion
included the following exact wording:
      •Review Western Wall Design and Landscaping
      •Review and Make Recommendations to Director of Planning regarding:
             –Building materials
             –Colors
             –Craftsmanship‐related detailing associated with the project
      •Purpose is to “ensure the ARB reviews the exterior materials and colors and architectural details to improve
      design linkages”
      •“Recommend ARB Consider Recessed Pedestrian Entries to Improve the Pedestrian Experience of Building”
      •Approval of Project is subject to actual Project Matching Option 1
      •“Direct Staff to return with written findings for adoption”


      The proposed Western wall design is incongruous does not relate to the rest of the building. The proposed
      landscaping does not match the original design of Option #1 and does not soften the stark cement block
      design. The multi‐story potted vines do not grow as advertised. The craftsmanship and construction materials are
      not appropriate for the proposed side. A review of a similar building at 102 University Avenue shows that the
      building is not aging well and has significant cracks in the cement. The building does not transition appropriately
      to its neighbors. The building is not pedestrian friendly as requested in the City Council Motion. Overall, this
      building is not compatible with the City Council Motion, and we ask you to refute the design and let the Planning
      Department know that it does not meet the standards of the Palo Alto ARB.
      Thank you for your detailed review of this building and how it complies with the City Council Motion, Palo Alto
      Municipal Codes, Downtown Design Guidelines, and the Comprehensive Plan.
      Sincerely,
      Michael Harbour, MD, MPH, FACP
      Lead Appellant 429 University Ave

Subject:             Re: City 311 referral system update one year later


A month has gone by since I asked if you'd seen the Deputy City Manager response to my 311 system questions and I
had yet to hear back from you. Nothing has ever really changed with the system, how it operates and how it's handled by
City staff since it's inception nor in the last year since I met face to face with new incoming City Manager Ed Shikada to
discuss my concerns . City staff are aware of the system shortcomings and I imagine always have been. The new Deputy
City Manager seems to have an excellent understanding of what needs to be done to correct the situation but states it will
take quite a while to make the corrections to the system and currently staff isn't available to assign to the tasks of making
the corrections and overseeing the system once the corrections are made.

I know this type of system can work for a city if it's set up properly and managed on an on-going basis. I retired the first
part of last year as a code enforcement officer with a neighboring city that also had a system for public service/inquiries
similar to Palo Alto's 311. A few noticeable differences however between the two systems. Our direction was to make
contact with the citizen within twenty four hours of receiving the initial inquiry. We were then expected to resolve the issue
within a week or give weekly updates to the citizen and City oversight staff until the issue was resolved. Then moving
forward, depending on the issue, City staff that had been assigned the issue initially were expected to monitor the
situation to assure it didn't reoccur.

Therefore I hope in the not too distant future staff can be allocated to start upgrading the system and oversee it is
responsive to the needs/requests of the citizens of Palo Alto.

        City Council Members:
        I contacted all of you a little over a year ago via e-mail with concerns over how the 311 system was being
        managed by the City. To be more precise my concern was that nobody in the City was responsible for
        overseeing the operation of the system. I offered a number of examples of how this lack of overall
        oversight was leading to all sorts of problems in the system including but not limited to excessive delays
        before items were ever addressed, indication in the system that items had been addressed when either
        they hadn't been addressed at all or had only been partially addressed and items that sat in the system
        and were never addressed at all. At the time I only received a response from a single Council member
        who indicated they shared many of my concerns. I never heard from anyone else over the last twelve
        months. I realize you all have a lot of issues on your plates but this seems like a city wide issue that
        should concern all of you and would have triggered more than just the lone response I received. I can't

Dear Members of the City Council,

Once again I want to direct your attention to the cluttered front yard next to mine. The address is 18 Roosevelt Circle.

If you look back at email I have sent to you (mostly through Karen Holman), you will see that this is a long‐existing
problem in our neighborhood.

I implore you to do something about this. It is a blight on our neighborhood and on our lovely city. Whatever you can do
to ameliorate the situation will be greatly appreciated—not only by me, but by my whole neighborhood.

With sincere thanks—and hope,

Dear Ms. Chavez,

I don't know what happened to Jason           whether he is dead or maybe just locked up somewhere but nobody is
able to reach him. It is truly a shame it has come to this point.

With whatever oversight capabilities you have, if Jason is in fact deceased, could you please see to it that the family
is given some respect and left alone to grieve peacefully and privately.

Knowing the Sheriff department and their history in this matter, I am concerned that they may show up at Jason's
funeral to threaten and terrorize his mother and other family members or that they may show up at the Markham
Plaza apartments to harass and threaten the residents to keep silent about what they have experenced and
witnessed.

There is no limit to how low they will go they are truly despicable. As history has repeatedly shown, this behavior will
not solve any problems it will only make matters worse and cause this scandal to escelate even worse and I should
hope nobody wants this to happen.

I pray that Jason is ok and that everyone is safe.

I also ask that if anyone hears from Jason or has news about his situation or whereabouts to please let me know.

Thank you,
Cindy (MPTA)

        Thurs. Oct. 4, 2018

     Just saw the last 20 min. of "Dark Money" again, for the third time. That is how I learn something. You should see
me when I've seen it ten times.

      Campaign finance reform is what we need, it shows. Citizens United said that the company there was a person
and had a right to free speech, as do all persons in the U.S. The problem is not its identifiable free speech, it is the
ANONYMOUS free speech which the decision has led to through the 501(c)(4) non‐profits which are the PACS.

       Mr. Wittich, the Montana legislator, is shown being convicted in Montana for the following: His campaign
"coordinated" (key term) with the dark money PAC. How? He worked with the dark money PAC to design his campaign.
They do the following for a candidate once they know he is on‐board with their program. They design, create and mail
the slick mailings targeting his opponent. They design and run radio and TV ads and pay to run them. They provide him
with statements to make to the press and in town‐halls. They tell him where to go on walking tours. They choose the
special interest groups for him to target in his campaign‐ things like right to life orgs, right to work orgs (in the Wittich
case), taxpayer groups, etc. They get his signature and photo to put on all of the mailings. They even create a hand‐
written letter to be signed by his wife saying what a hero he really is. I think the program showed that they even give
him drafts of legislation to introduce once he is elected, well fed, well housed and well clad.

      The trial showed that Wittich knew about all of this and that his campaign "coordinated" with the PAC. He had
told them he wanted the complete treatment or the whole deal or some such term. AND THEN, knowing the value of all
of this to his campaign, he did not disclose that in his campaign finance disclosure required by law. He took corporate
campaign contributions without reporting it, therefore. Convicted, the judge fined him $68,000, but did not remove him
from office. The voters did that in the next primary.

     Maybe I'm dreaming, but it seems that this approach might work to convict lots of politicians who accept huge,
expensive, full‐on coordinated campaign programs from the 501(c)(4)s, ones they knew about and cooperated with and
coordinated with fully.

      Until then, we desperately need campaign finance reform in the United States. Notice that these anonymous
PACS can accept contributions from any source, even foreign ones. Sound familiar?

       The candidate, under current law, can say to someone or some corporation, or some government, "I can't take
your money without reporting it, but you can give money to that PAC over there that supports me and they do not have
to report where the money came from". This is how politicians can be bribed now, all very legal.

       I've wondered of late how the various candidates can afford the big, slick brochures they mail out. They have
clearly gotten bigger and more expensive, some of them multi‐page affairs.

 I strongly recommend it, unless, of course, you are convinced that our political system is clean and honest, and that
 special interests have only very limited influence on our elections.

         I won't say that this is a second "shot heard round the world", (that should have been the first shots that LBJ
 caused to be fired in Viet Nam), but this is an eye‐opener.

        Recipients living outside of the Central Valley should look for Dark Money on PBS. I can't believe it will only be
 run once between now and November. Or even pay to see it on YouTube.

     Doug‐ We've been naïve. Watch this to see how dark money now works in politics. Our country is nearly lost.

       This is a trailer:

      http://www.pbs.org/pov/darkmoney/video/what‐is‐dark‐money‐dark‐money‐‐/

      Here's another trailer:

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4OGlW1JJpc&list=PL3ODbKmHhkJ8abbJpVveL_qD00g_mFoM5

       I don't seem to find the full program on YouTube. It is very worthwhile seeing, especially if you think we have an
honest political system.

      Citizens United decision by the Sup. Ct. had a lot to do with this, apparently. I didn't go to Viet Nam. If they tried
to murder me now in such a deal, I'd REALLY resist.

       I rarely watch these POVs. Usually about inner city downtrodden wondering how they got that way. But I
stumbled into this one, and it is interesting. If you thought Montana must be pure and clean, this will change your
mind. I sure get the big glossy brochures from the candidates. Full of lies and distortions, as are their tv ads. Solution,
probably move to Deutschland. We can believe nothing we hear from those in government or those trying to get
elected to it. Down through history, that has often provoked a strong reaction from the governed when it goes on long
enough.

Hi Molly,

I wanted to follow up on the tobacco flavored ban, this is still in affect and begins in January right?

Our 7‐Eleven is in downtown Palo Alto, and I believe we will no longer be able to sell flavored tobacco? Will someone
come out and assist us in identifying what we can and cannot sell?

 Hello,



 I received the attached letter (7‐Eleven, 401 Waverley St).

I see in the letter there are 2 different ordinances:



1) July 1, 2018 ‐ Ban Tobacco Sales at Pharmacies, and the Tobacco Retail Permit




2) Jan. 1 2019 ‐ Ban Flavored Tobacco at certain establishments.



Then on the bottom there is a date for a hearing, does this hearing include both ordinance's or is it just for the July 1st
ordinance?



Reason I ask is because I went to the http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/smokingordinance website, and it doesn't mention
anything about Flavored Tobacco ban.



Please let me know, as a retailer the 2nd ordinance impacts our business and also creates a blackmarket for these
products that I rather not have in our neighborhoods. We already go through a rigorous ID checking process to insure
no minors are sold products to, and also subscribe to a mystery shop service to check our employees on a consistent
basis.

Thank you, Beth. This will, at least, start me on the trail (or should I say, trial) of determining who did
what, and what concerns they might have. I really would ask that you add a simple text search capability
for these minutes; it would seem that it would help you, too.

Let me be very clear about my purpose here. I need this information to determine which of you I will vote
back into office. I can find out what my representatives in congress voted on, and I can find out what my
senators voted on. I cannot even find a search box for the past Minutes on the Palo Alto Council pages.
Can you really suggest that the Palo Alto City Council is less transparent than one of the worst federal
legislatures in my lifetime?




Thank you for your consideration,




Andrew Sharpe

Subject:             Single use plastic mitigation idea for Palo Alto



Dear Mayor Kniss and City Council Members --

I am a PA resident, living at 728 Channing Ave, Palo Alto, 94301. I am writing to suggest an idea for
the Palo Alto school district: that all schools provide eco-friendly water bottles to all students [in order
to reduce the city's overall single use plastic numbers and related carbon footprint/environmental
harm].

I just read about an effort now being launched by the New York City Mayor's Office and the water
bottle company S'Well to provide 320,000 free water bottles to New York City public school students.
The goal is to help the city reach its target of cutting 54 million single use bottles per year.

While the company sponsoring the New York effort alongside the Mayor's office is NYC-based, there
are many Bay Area based companies that I imagine would be willing to replicate such an effort, such
as: Camelback, Sports Basement, The North Face, Klean Kanteen. Here is a list that may inspire
ideas.

In light of today's terrifying climate change report release by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change,
I figure we need to do everything we can ‐‐ including seemingly small steps like reducing plastic use.

Please let me know what you think and if there is more I can do to support this idea.

Thank you very much for all you do!
Madeline

Dear Council Members,

When traffic is flowing North on Alpine Road (green light) the cars going South are stopped because the light is red at
the Alpine/Junipero intersection.

Why? This makes no sense. Can this be corrected?

To Whom It May Concern:

This letter is written in support of the Corner House on Addison community center project, also known as the “CoHo,”
whose initial proposal for the city council was held on Monday, October 1st of 2018. As a Licensed Marriage and Family
Therapist, trained Postpartum Doula and Parent Educator serving families in Palo Alto for nearly a decade, I believe this
resource would be an asset to the needs and enrichment of modern parents, children and the general population of
your city through customized programs and comprehensive support for busy and diverse local families. It is my hope
that the project receives the approval it deserves in order to accomplish that.

Thank you for your consideration on this project, I am excited to see this unique facility progress for the benefit of the
residents of Palo Alto.

I wanted to echo my support for The Corner House on Addison (or the “CoHo”) that will be a “family hub” for the
community

The CoHo takes a commercial property and turns it into a community center, designed around the needs of busy,
modern families with a special focus on kids and working moms.

What a great gift to the community !

I hope you can support this and expedite its approval

My children are grown now but I would have loved this “in the day”. !

Thanks

Subject:             Time to respond to a question and a comment ..........


At Monday’s City Council Meeting, Council Member Tanaka asked if the 980 Middlefield neighbors would prefer a
mortuary to the proposed project. Instead of being rude by shouting an answer, I will give him and you my reply
now: “Yes”. Why? The mortuary staff was/would be far, far less intrusive. The former mortuary staff was respectful and
courteous. Based on past history, I seriously doubt the current applicant would be concerned about neighborhood
residents’ quality of life.

Council Member Scharff suggested the applicant could do more or better outreach. Let me respond to this suggestion.
There has been no neighborhood outreach that I and others are aware of, unless you want to classify the numerous out
of control events held by the applicant at her home and 980 Middlefield Road as outreach.

(A more pertinent question for Council Member Scharff is did this applicant or her consultants/advisors reach out to
you (Council Members) prior to this meeting? From the comments I heard it appears this happened, but instead of
speculating I would like to know for the public record which Council Members spoke to Ms. Mayer or her advisors prior
to Monday’s meeting. Similarly did you have any meetings with people in the neighborhood?)

Here is the real issue. Speakers the other nigh expressed concerns about traffic and parking, which is understandable.
My belief is that this is not the only concern with this project. Anyone who has lived near this applicant knows the mess
that would occur if this project is approved. The applicant’s neighbors, myself included, have experienced countless
offensive behaviors and intrusions to our everyday lives. Our neighborhood has been and will be blanked with valet
parked cars. We have been and will be subjected to constant noise, idling cars, delivery trucks double parking on
Addison Avenue over several days, and people walking and talking and shouting as they pass homes late at night.
Frankly I could go on and on about the egregious acts that have occurred. All we can expect to have happen is similar
behaviors, but on a grander scale, if this application is submitted and approved.

I am constantly asked by people in town how I can live in such an environment. One thing that surprises me is that
current City Council Members are unaware of what has been happening. Have you never asked or heard from people
about what has gone on or is it that you prefer not to know?

The difference between now and after this project is approved, if that happens, is the applicant’s response will no longer
be that “I can do whatever I want on my property” or ignore complaints about conforming to existing ordinances. Now,
it will be that the city has sanctioned and legitimized this bad behavior. The 600 person party proposed for 980
Middlefield by the applicant that was denied by planning staff will be harder to refuse. Numerous super large events
would be likely and may be the real motivation for this proposal. The potential is for a significant detrimental impact on
the surrounding neighborhoods that will last long term.

Yes, the project is couched in a feel good concept, a place for professional women. Some want to view it as a project for
entrepreneurs or current overburdened working women, but let’s be honest. This is a convenient guise for helping get
an events center with condoned large scale and highly intrusive events. One City Council Member’s comment wanted to
exacerbate the situation by suggesting a Neighborhood Commercial zoning for the site, allowing for any number of uses
incompatible with a residential neighborhood.




                                                             1
As I mentioned on Monday, there is nothing inherent in this site that justifies this facility or any similar commercial
operation being in this neighborhood. If it is that desired, ask staff to identify other locations in town where it could be
located.

The pre‐screen process was instituted on my watch. The idea was not to move a project forward that would cost an
applicant and city staff, time and money only to eventually see it fail. That is where this proposal is possibly headed.

I am reminded of a similar situation in the early 1980s where an applicant and some supporters made promises and
espoused the worthiness of a project. After numerous meetings, and a growing neighborhood opposition with over 300
neighbors attending the final city council meeting, , the project was rejected. Though time has passed and some of those
neighbors have moved or died, the core leadership team still lives in this neighborhood. Then as now, their goal was to
ensure an R‐1 neighborhood and maintain an environment for comradery, neighborliness, safety, and respectful
interactions.

Past experience by this applicant makes it clear that anything goes and people’s quality of life is more than at
risk. Maybe it is good this happened now because it is time to end this non‐sense and the negative intrusion into
peoples’ lives.

Respectfully submitted,

Vic Ojakian, Former Two‐Term City Council Member and Mayor

City Council members,

I appreciate the updates to the ADU ordinance and hope that you will vigorously pursue the suggestions for:
