 Dear Mayor and Council Members:

 On behalf of City Manager Jim Keene, please find below in bold staff responses to inquiries
 made by Vice Mayor Filseth and Council Member Tanaka in regard to the May 14, 2018
 council meeting agenda.

 Item 5: FY 2018 Street Resurfacing Project Construction Contract Award – CM Tanaka

 ID# 9053: Annual Report for FY17 Santa Clara County Multi‐Jurisdictional Flood
 Preparedness/Awareness – Vice Mayor Filseth

 ID# 9168: Middlefield Road North Traffic Safety Project‐Collision Analysis – Vice Mayor
 Filseth


 Item 5: FY 2018 Street Resurfacing Project Construction Contract Award – CM Tanaka

           Q. 1. What is the current average PCI for Palo Alto?

           A. 1. The current PCI is 84.

           Q. 2. Why was it determined that the roads need to be repaved?
           A. 2. All streets segments are surveyed biennially to rate their condition. The last
           city‐wide survey was completed in December 2017. The streets selected are
           based on recent street survey conditions and coordination with Utility
           Department and Transportation Division projects. The average PCI of the
           selected streets is 53.




                                                               1
 ID# 9053: Annual Report for FY17 Santa Clara County Multi‐Jurisdictional Flood
 Preparedness/Awareness – Vice Mayor Filseth

        Q. 1. A FEMA program for Flood Insurance Discounts (“NFIP”) claims to save Palo
        Alto residents $740K/year on flood insurance because we have a good “Community
        Rating” due to some Public Works programs.
        Whom residents actually save money from, i.e. Allstate, State Farm, etc.?


        A. 1. Residents who have properties that are in a flood zone and have an
        outstanding mortgage are required to have flood insurance. With a CRS rating of
        7 they are paying less to their insurance companies (i.e.: Allstate, State Farm,
        etc.) than they would have with a CRS rating of 6 or lower.


        Q. 2. Does the City spend a lot of time and effort on this?


        A. 2. City staff routinely reviews and approves building permit applications for
        projects in Palo Alto’s flood hazard area. In addition, several times a week staff
        answer questions from residents who either recently purchased a property or are
        considering remodeling their home. However, in regards to the FEMA audit, it
        occurs only once every five years. In preparation for the audit, City staff gather
        copies of the building permits, elevation certificates prepared, and prepare a
        package for FEMA to review and approve. Preparing for the audit can be labor
        intensive, but again it only occurs once every 5 years. Palo Alto is also required to
        re‐certify the community yearly. However, due to FEMA’s limited resources, Palo
        Alto has not needed to be re‐certified in 2016 or 2017.



 ID# 9168: Middlefield Road North Traffic Safety Project‐Collision Analysis – Vice Mayor
 Filseth

        Q. 1. Looks like the Middlefield Road pilot between Palo Alto Ave and Lytton is a
        huge success in reducing car collisions. Do I read that right? Collisions went from
        an average of ~8 per year before the pilot, to zero in the year since?


        A. 1. That’s correct. Middlefield Road pilot project between Palo Alto Ave and
        Lytton has been successful in reducing car collisions. During the five years (2012‐
        2016), an average of 8 collisions were reported along the project corridor and
        zero collision reported for the same period in 2017, after the start of the pilot.



Thank you,
Judy Ng
