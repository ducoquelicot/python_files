                    City Council Staff Report

Report Type: Action Items                       Meeting Date: 12/17/2018

Summary Title: Approval of Amended CAO Employment Agreements

Title: Approval of Annual Amendments to the Employment Agreements
Between the City of Palo Alto and Council Appointed Officers

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Human Resources

Recommended Motion
Staff recommends that Council consider the following motion:

Approve and authorize the Mayor to execute the following contract amendments for Council
Approved Officers:
      1) Amendment No. Six to Employment Agreement between the City of Palo Alto and
         Molly S. Stump;
      2) Amendment No. Four to Employment Agreement between the City of Palo Alto and
         Harriet M. Richardson; and,
      3) Amendment No. Four to Employment Agreement between the City of Palo Alto and
         Beth D. Minor.

Recommendation
The City Council has completed annual merit reviews for Council Appointed Officers (CAOs) for
the prior fiscal year’s performance (FY2017/18). Staff has been directed by City Council to
forward amendments to employment agreements to implement merit-based increases to the
CAO’s annual salaries, effective July 1, 2018, as follows: City Attorney Molly S. Stump, merit
increase of 5% from $284,253 to $298,480 (Attachment A); City Auditor Harriet Richardson,
merit increase of 4% from $187,533 to $195,042 (Attachment B); and City Clerk Beth Minor,
merit increase of 4% from $146,806 to $152,693 (Attachment C)

Discussion
In accordance with the CAO employment agreements, the City Council evaluates performance
and determines any merit-based salary increases at the conclusion of each fiscal year, with an
effective date of July 1. The evaluation process begins in approximately May of each year but
often takes several months to complete, as it is an extensive process with multiple steps. Since
2014, City Council has obtained facilitation services from the Municipal Resources Group (MRG)

City of Palo Alto                                                                         Page 1
to assist with the annual process. MRG’s role includes conducting Council interviews and
surveys, collecting data and facilitating closed session discussions.

The CAO employment agreements do not include provisions for general wage or other
adjustments provided to other management employees. Thus, the merit-based pay increase for
each CAO described in this memo is the only annual increase to be provided. All other terms
and conditions of the employment agreements remain the same.

As is customary, City Council met in closed session to discuss an evaluation and potential salary
adjustment for the City Manager, as it does for all Council Appointed Officers. Before the
Council had deliberated on the City Manager’s evaluation, City Manager Jim Keene let the
Council know that he would voluntarily refuse to accept any salary increase were it to be
offered. The Council is appreciative of Jim Keene’s leadership and dedication to the community
and wishes him well on his pending retirement.

Resource Impact

Sufficient funding is available for the additional salary of approximately $27,600 total for the
three CAO positions in the respective departmental FY2018 Adopted Budgets. The fully-loaded
cost, including the additional salary, pension contribution and benefits is approximately
$38,600.

Environmental Review
Approval of these amended employment agreements will not result in any environmental
impacts.

                 3.7 hours per bi-weekly pay period based on a forty-hour per designated workweek schedule.
                 Richardson may, if necessary, use up to forty-eight hours of sick leave at any time during the
                 first six months of employment. Use of sick leave shall be subject to the policies and procedures
                 set forth in the Merit System Rules and Regulations.

                                      5.6.   Relocation and Temporary Housing Expenses. The City will
                 provide Richardson with a total amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) for
                 relocation and temporary housing expenses, paid on a reimbursement basis for actual costs
                 incurred. The City shall reimburse Richardson for relocation expenses actually incurred as
                 described in Section B (“Basic Package”) and C (“Optional Package”) of the City’s Relocation
                 Expense Policy (Policy & Procedure 2-08).

                               7.     Duration of Employment. Richardson understands and agrees that she has
                no constitutionally protected property or other interest in her employment as City Auditor.
                Richardson waives any and all rights, if any, under the Merit System Rules and Regulations,
                including without limitation, the right to pre-or post-disciplinary due process. Richardson
                understands and agrees that she works at the will and pleasure of the City Council and that she
                may be terminated or asked to resign at any time, with or without cause. Richardson may
                terminate this agreement (terminating all employment) upon 30 days written notice to the City
                Council.

                                       7.1.  Severance Pay. If Richardson is asked to resign or is terminated as
                City Auditor she shall receive a cash severance payment or payments (without interest) at
                intervals specified by Richardson, equaling three (3) months salary and benefits at the date of
                termination. The monthly non-salary benefits shall be those specified in sections 4 and 5. All
                normal withholdings as required by law shall be made with respect to any amounts paid under
                this section.

                                       7.2    Non-Payment of Severance Under Certain Conditions. If the City
                terminates Richardson for conduct that would otherwise constitute a felony, regardless of
                whether Richardson is actually convicted on a felony charge, the City shall not owe and
                Richardson shall not receive any severance pay.

                                                                 3
