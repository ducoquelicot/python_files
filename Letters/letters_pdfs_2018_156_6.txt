                    City Council Staff Report

Report Type: Informational Report                 Meeting Date: 6/11/2018

Summary Title: Energy Risk Management Report

Title: City of Palo Alto's Energy Risk Management Report for the First Half of
Fiscal Year 2018

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Administrative Services

Recommendation
This is an informational report and no City Council action is required.

Executive Summary
Staff continues to purchase electricity and gas in compliance with the City’s Energy Risk
Management Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures. This report is based on market prices and
load and supply data as of December 31, 2017, the end of the first half of Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.

The projected cost of the City’s fixed-price electricity purchases is $0.09 million lower than the
market value of that electricity as of December 31, 2017 for the 12-month period beginning
January 1, 2018. In the first half of FY 2018 (July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) the City’s
credit exposure to fixed price contracts is minimal. The projected Electric Supply Operations
Reserve is above the FY 2018 minimum guideline reserve level and the projected gas reserve is
also above the FY 2018 guideline reserve level range.

There were no exceptions to the Energy Risk Management Policies, Guidelines, or Procedures
to report during the first half of FY 2018.

Background
The purpose of this report is to inform the Council about the status of the City’s energy
portfolio and transactions executed with energy suppliers as of the end of the first half of FY
2018. The City’s Energy Risk Management Policy requires that staff report on a quarterly basis
but due to lower trading activity levels the Utility Risk Oversight Coordinating Committee
(UROCC) has approved providing this report on a semi-annual basis to Council on: 1) the City’s
energy portfolio; 2) the City’s credit and market risk profile; 3) portfolio performance; and 4)
other key market and risk information.

The City’s Energy Risk Management Policy describes the management organization, authority,
and processes to monitor, measure, and control market risks. “Market risks” include price and
counterparty credit risk. These are risks that the City is exposed to on a regular basis in
procuring electric supplies, and to a lesser extent for gas supplies which are purchased at
market rates via a monthly index price. The energy risk management section is located in the
Treasury Division of the Administrative Services Department. Its role is to monitor and mitigate
these risks.

This first half of FY 2018 energy risk management report contains information on the following:

        Electric Supplies
        Hydroelectricity
        Fixed-Price Forward Electricity Purchases
        Gas Supplies
        Credit Risk
        Electric Forward Mark-to-Market Values
        Electric and Gas Supply Operations Reserves Adequacy
        Exceptions to Energy Risk Management Policies, Guidelines, or Procedures

Discussion
Electric Supplies
In order to serve the City’s electric supply demands, the City obtains electricity from:
hydroelectric resources (from Western and Calaveras Hydroelectric Projects); long-term
renewable energy contracts (from landfill gas converted to electricity, wind, and solar projects);
wholesale purchases which are carried out via fixed-priced forward market purchase contracts;
and the electric spot market.

Figure 1 below illustrates the projected sources and expected purchases of electricity supplies
by month for the 36 months from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020, in megawatt-hours
(MWh). Sales of surplus energy in the summer months are typical due to the seasonal profile of
the City’s generating portfolio as a result of renewable energy power from hydroelectricity,
solar, and wind.

Hydroelectricity
The cost of hydroelectricity received from Western over the 12-month period ending December
31, 2017 is lower than the market value of electricity by $5.1 million. Hydroelectric power from
Calaveras was expected to cost $6.7 million (as of December 31, 2017) more than the market
value of electricity. Note that Calaveras provides benefits not reflected in the mark-to-market
(MTM) calculation, including, for example, ancillary services (e.g., the ability to regulate energy
output when the electric grid needs change), and that much of the above-market costs are
related to debt service on the cost of constructing the dam. This debt is due to be retired in
2032, and retirement will substantially improve the value of the project relative to the market
price of electricity.

Fixed-Price Forward Electricity Purchases
The City as of December 31, 2017 has purchased and/or sold fixed-priced supplies of electricity
totaling 103,370 MWh for delivery in FY 2018 with an average price of $35.06 per MWh. The
City contracted for these purchases with three of its approved counterparties: Powerex, Exelon,
and NextEra Energy Resources. The 12-month MTM value of the City’s forward transactions for
wholesale power was $0.09 million at the end of the first half of FY 2018. In other words, the
purchase cost (contract price) for these transactions was lower than the market value as of
December 31, 2017. The City tracks the mark to market value of its forward contracts to
measure the value that would be lost due to a counterparty failing to deliver on its contractual
commitments, forcing the City to purchase replacement electricity in the market. The exposure

listed above is well within risk management guidelines and presents little risk to the City’s
financial outlook.

The figures below represent the electric forward volumes (Figure 2) and MTM positions (Figure
3) for each electric supplier by month of delivery for all forward fixed-price electricity contracts
over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018.

Gas Supplies
In order to serve the City’s natural gas needs, the City purchases gas on the monthly and daily
spot markets. The City purchases all of its forecasted gas needs for the month ahead at a price
based on the published monthly spot market index price for that month. Within the month, the
City’s gas operator buys and sells gas to match the City’s daily needs if the actual daily usage is
different from the forecasted daily usage. Those daily transactions are made at an average price
based on the published daily spot market index. These costs are passed through directly to
customers using a monthly rate adjustment mechanism, leaving the City with little or no price
risk or counterparty risk exposure for the gas utility.

Credit Risk
Staff monitors and reports on counterparty credit risk based on the major credit rating agencies
(S&P and Moody’s) scores, Ameresco has a 0.68 percent Expected Default Frequency (EDF)
which is higher than the recommended EDF level. As May 2018, this has declined to 0.45
percent so there has been an improvement. Staff is continuing to monitor Ameresco’s EDF and
will continue to report back to City Council. Table 1 below shows the EDF values for the City’s
renewable energy counterparties. Table 2 below shows the EDF values and credit exposure for
the City’s electric suppliers. There is virtually no credit exposure to the City’s gas suppliers since
the supplies are purchased on a short-term basis.

Electric Forward Mark-to-Market Values
It is important to note that, for renewable energy companies, Council waived the investment
grade credit rating requirement of Section 2.30.340(d) of the Palo Alto Municipal Code, which
applies to energy companies that do business with the City. In addition, the City does not pay
for renewable energy until it is received, thereby reducing risk.

An EDF of 0.08% or below indicates supplier’s current expected default frequency falls within
the investment grade range. An EDF above 0.08% indicates the supplier may have financial
issues that require monitoring.

Electric and Gas Supply Operations Reserves Adequacy
As shown in Table 3 below, the Electric Supply Operations reserve’s unaudited balance as of
December 31, 2017 is $13.9 million, which is $2.3 million below the minimum reserve guideline
level. By year end, transfers from the rate stabilization and other reserves are expected to bring
this to the middle of the reserve guideline. This balance is above the immediate 12-month
credit, hydro, and other risks that have been identified, and are estimated at $3.2 million. The
unaudited Gas Operations reserve balance as of December 31, 2017 is $12.1 million, which is
$5.9 million above the minimum reserve guideline level.
