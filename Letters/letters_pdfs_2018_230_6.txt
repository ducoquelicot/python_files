Vision: Palo Alto Airport strives to balance the
rights of pilots to fly with the rights of neighbors to
a peaceful living environment. This document is a
report of the noise complaints received by the
airport in 2017. Airport staff uses this information
to identify trends in neighboring communities.
These trends inform communications between
airport staff and pilots on the issue of noise.
Introduction:

The following is a report of noise complaints received by Palo Alto Airport (PAO) in 2017. The Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) defines air travel routes and procedures, including defining separation
distances between aircraft, determining hazards to aviation and all other safety criteria for aircraft, and
is responsible for directing and enforcing the movement of aircraft in flight. Although organizations can
petition the FAA regarding flight procedures, the FAA has the final say in what is safe and acceptable.
The Airport Noise and Capacity Act (ANCA) of 1990 federally prohibits public-use airports from
restricting airspace in anyway.

The FAA measures noise based on the Yearly Day and Night Average Sound Level (DNL) and the
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). While both are essentially the same, airports in California use
the CNEL method to measure noise. CNEL is a method of averaging single event aircraft noise into a
weighted 24-hour average. The system adds penalties to all events occurring during the evening (7pm –
10pm) and the night (10pm – 7am). The Santa Clara County Airport Land Use Commission (SCC ALUC)
performed a noise study for the Palo Alto Airport using the CNEL to determine the noise contours for 55,
60, 65, and 70 decibels. The contour map is included as Attachment A.

Regarding safety and altitude, the FAA has in place Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) that establishes
Minimum Safe Altitudes (MSAs) for aircraft. For fixed wing aircraft, the minimum is 1000 feet above
ground when over congested areas and 500 feet when not over congested areas. These minimum
altitudes apply to all fixed wing aircraft except when necessary for landing and takeoff operations.
Helicopters are exempt from these altitude restrictions due to the nature of their flight. These minimum
altitudes are enforced by the FAA Flight Standards District Office in San Jose and not Palo Alto Airport.
Although, Palo Alto Airport cannot tell pilots when or where to fly; the airport, however, does have
voluntary noise abatement procedures that Palo Alto Airport recommends that pilots follow. (See the
Noise Abatement Procedures section below.)

The airport receives noise complaints via email at pao@cityofpaloalto.org and a noise complaint hotline
650-329-2405. Airport staff review and timely respond to all complaints ascertaining as much
information from complainants, including contact information, date, time and description of the
occurrence. Various flight trackers can be used in an attempt to help identify the aircraft involved and
verify if FAA regulations or Palo Alto Airport procedures were violated. The airport staff reviews and
compiles all data to determine trends with flying activities.

Purpose:

The purpose of the Palo Alto Airport Annual
Noise Report is to identify noise trends in the
surrounding areas and determine compliance
with established voluntary noise abatement
procedures.

Airspace:

The Palo Alto Airport airspace is unique. The
congested Bay Area airspace is dominated by                                           Palo Alto Airport Sectional Map
                                                                                            Palo Alto Airport in Green
SFO Class Bravo airspace, which encompasses a                                         PAO Airspace highlighted in Red
                                                       Source: http://vfrmap.com/?type=vfrc&lat=37.461&lon=-122.115&zoom=10
30 nautical mile radius around SFO. Underneath the Class Bravo airspace lays the Class Charlie airspace
of Oakland and San Jose international airports. Finally, Moffett Airfield lies approximately 4 nautical
miles to the southeast of Palo Alto Airport.

As a result, Palo Alto Airport airspace ends only 1.5 nautical miles southeast of Runway 31’s final
approach. To land at Palo Alto Airport, aircraft must turn before entering Moffett’s airspace, resulting in
aircraft having to space themselves in traffic patterns over the peninsula when take-off/landing volumes
peak. The FAA’s Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) at Palo Alto Airport has a letter of agreement with
Moffett’s ATCT providing Palo Alto Airport aircraft with extensions into Moffett airspace when Moffett
airfield is not in use. The additional airspace is a useful mitigation tool during busy times.

Further restrictions in Palo Alto Airport airspace come from San Jose Class C airspace, starting at 1500
feet Mean Sea Level, just southeast of Palo Alto Airport and SFO Class B airspace, starting at 2500 feet
Mean Sea Level, just northeast of the Palo Alto Airport. Both are identified on the Palo Alto Airport
Sectional Map: San Jose Class C is shown with thick magenta lines and SFO Class B is shown with thick
blue lines. These restrictions play a vital role in aircraft departures, in turn influencing noise abatement
procedures for the Palo Alto Airport.

Noise Abatement Procedures:

Noise abatement procedures are voluntary procedures that the airport asks pilots to follow. The airport
is prohibited from restricting airspace. Palo Alto Airport staff will speak with individual pilots and
educate them about the voluntary noise abatement procedures. The Palo Alto Airport cannot levy fines
on pilots that violate the voluntary noise procedures. For illustrated noise abatement procedures
reference Palo Alto Airport Pilots Handout included as Attachment B.

Pilots are asked to fly over the bay whenever possible. If pilots must fly over the peninsula, they are
asked to reduce power and fly at or above 1500 feet above ground before crossing Highway 101. Staff
also asks that aircraft not make a left crosswind departure, but instead make a “Left Dumbarton
Departure” (fly to the Dumbarton Auto Bridge before making a left turn and flying over East Palo Alto) or
a right 270 degree turn whenever departing to the south or west from Runway 31. When aircraft are
using Runway 13, pilots are asked to make a left 270 departure before flying west over Palo Alto.

For arrivals, it is standard practice and necessary for pilots to descend to pattern altitude before
entering the traffic pattern around PAO, sometimes requiring aircraft to descend below the 1500 feet
minimum over Palo Alto. As these aircraft are descending to land the engines are generally powered
back and quieter than ascending aircraft.

Airport staff continuously engages with tenants and pilots about the voluntary noise abatement
procedures, always noting that safety always supersedes noise.


Findings:

The Palo Alto Airport remains the third busiest airport in the bay area with an average of 166,000
operations per year since 2010, significantly less than the average of 198,000 operations per year
between 1990 and 2009 (Table 1). An operation is defined as either a takeoff or a landing and a touch-
and-go procedure will account for two operations.

Table 3 sorts the complaints logged into three sections. The first one is PAO which includes all
complaints that involve aircraft that performed an operation at the airport. The next section is General
which includes complaints that did not include a specific aircraft or incident of noise. These complaints
may or may not involve aircraft from PAO. The last section is Non-PAO, which include aircraft that are
not based or did not operate at the airport. These flights could include CHP, Coast Gard, Air Taxis, Survey
and or banner towing operations. Also included in Table 3 is the total for 2016.

Table 4 provides a detailed breakdown of the 1033 PAO related complaints by city. Most complaints
came from Sunnyvale, with 963 complaints logged from 21 households, but note that 840 complaints
  came from 2 households accounting for 81% of all noise complaints. Palo Alto was the second most
  impacted city, with 31 complaints from 4 households.

  Starting in August of 2016, weather patterns shifted and the prevailing winds were from the south. This
  weather pattern, which is normally seen during stormy weather, persisted for several months into the
  fourth quarter. This southern wind caused San Jose International jet arrivals to descend over Sunnyvale
  before turning to the south over the bay to land. At the same time, Surf Air changed their approach to
  the Bay Side Approach which flew over Sunnyvale. This coincides with the increase in noise complaints
  from Sunnyvale during the fourth quarter of 2016 and continued into 2017. Note: there has been no
  change to PAO activity or flight paths during this time.


                                                                                        Table 5. Aircraft Type

  Table 5 above shows the general type of aircraft identified as causing noise complaints at the airport.
  There were 23 complaints where staff was unable to identify the type of aircraft involved in the flight.
  There are 2 types of engines for aircraft utilizing PAO. The first is reciprocating which is similar to an
  automobile engine, and the second is turboprop which is a turbine engine with a propeller that
produces thrust. Aircraft are further differentiated by “multi” and “single” which denotes the number of
engines for the aircraft. In the case of PAO all multi engine aircraft will be only have 2 engines. As Table
5 shows single reciprocating aircraft produced the largest portion of noise complaints. This class of
aircraft represents most of the fleet at PAO and usually consists of Cessna, Pipers and Cirrus aircraft.


Table 6 below shows the number of violations of the established noise abatement procedures. Airport
staff makes every effort to talk to all aircraft that violate these procedures, but it is difficult to talk to all
transient pilots about noise abatement procedures. It is not the role of the FAA Air Traffic Control Tower
to advise pilots of the noise abatement procedures, the City has develop a working relationship with the
ATCT and Air Controllers do advise pilots of the noise abatement procedures when they have the ability.

                                PAO Noise Contour Map

Following is a noise contour map for PAO, adopted by the Santa Clara County Airport Land Use
Commission (SCC ALUC) in their 2008 Comprehensive Land Use Plan, reflecting the forecasted noise
contours for Palo Alto Airport in 2022.

SCC ALUC used the Integrated Noise Model which considers airport altitude, mean temperature, runway
configuration, aircraft flight track definition, aircraft departure and approach profiles, aircraft traffic
volume and fleet mix, and flight track utilization by aircraft types. All data is entered into the CNEL
formula to prepare the noise contours for Palo Alto Airport.

Refer to https://www.sccgov.org/sites/dpd/DocsForms/Documents/ALUC_20081119_PAO_CLUP.pdf,
for a more detailed description of how the SCC ALUC prepared this map.

The 65 decibel (db) noise level of the airport extends beyond the airport boundaries, but is only over
Palo Alto Golf Course, Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve, and the salt marshes in San Mateo County
and is the threshold at which FAA requires noise mitigation programs.

                                   PAO Pilot Handout

Santa Clara County created a Pilot Handout for Palo Alto Airport that described the noise abatement
procedures. When the City of Palo Alto assumed control of the airport, the existing noise abatement
procedures were adopted, with one exception, “pilots must maintain 1500 feet or above across Highway
101” was replaced with “Aircraft are asked to climb to and maintain at least 1500 feet before crossing
Highway 101.” The change is consistent with the voluntary nature of noise abatement procedures as
airports are federally prohibited from instructing pilots how to fly.
