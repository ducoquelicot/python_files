                                Proclamation
                National Crime Victims’ Rights Week April 8-14, 2018
    WHEREAS, Americans are the victims of 20 million crimes each year, affecting individuals and
communities, and with years of investment in crime victims’ rights and services have developed a system of
victim response that can help victims recover from crime; and
      WHEREAS, reaching and serving all victims of crime is essential to supporting thriving communities,
because those who receive holistic services and support are more likely to remain invested in their communities.
With dedicated victim service providers are working every day to meet the needs of crime victims, yet there are
still too many victims without meaningful access to rights and services; and
     WHEREAS, many victims face barriers—such as isolation, distrust of authorities, language limitations, lack
of transportation, or cultural barriers—that keep them from accessing the services and criminal justice systems
that can help them recover from crime; and
    WHEREAS, we must make a dedicated effort to expand the circle of those prepared to respond to victims
and link them to the resources that can help them recover; and
    WHEREAS, engaging a broader array of healthcare providers, community leaders, faith organizations,
educators, and businesses can provide new links between victims and services that improve their safety, healing,
and access to justice; and
    WHEREAS, National Crime Victims’ Rights Week provides an opportunity to recommit to ensuring that all
victims of crime— especially those who are challenging to reach or serve—are afforded their rights and receive a
trauma-informed response; and
     WHEREAS, the City of Palo Alto is hereby dedicated to strengthening victims and survivors in the
aftermath of crime, building resilience in our communities and our victim responders, and working for justice for
all victims and survivors.
    NOW, THEREFORE, I, Liz Kniss Mayor of the City of Palo Alto, on behalf of the City Council, do hereby
proclaim the week of April 8–14, 2018, as Crime Victims’ Rights Week And reaffirm the City of Palo Alto’s
commitment to creating a victim service and criminal justice response that assists all victims of crime during
Crime Victims’ Rights Week and throughout the year; and to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for
those community members, victim service providers, and criminal justice professionals who are committed to
improving our response to all victims of crime so that they may find relevant assistance, support, justice, and
peace.
