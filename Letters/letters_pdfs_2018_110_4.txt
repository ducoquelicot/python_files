Summary Title: 2nd Quarter 2018 ADU Development Activity Report

Title: Report to City Council on Accessory Dwelling Unit/Junior Accessory
Dwelling Unit Development Activity for Second Quarter 2018

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Planning and Community Environment


Recommendation
This is an informational report and no action is requested.

Background
The City Council adopted Ordinance No. 54121 on May 8, 2017, which amended Title 18
(Zoning) of the Palo Alto Municipal Code to implement State requirements related to
Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU) and to encourage the construction of accessory dwelling
units. At the time of the adoption of the updated regulations, Council directed staff to provide
quarterly reports on permits filed for the construction of accessory dwelling units. Council
received the last development report summary on May 7, 2018 (Report #89692).


Discussion
In the second quarter of 2018, a total of 20 ADU building permit applications were filed. All the
applications are under review. Except for one of the applications, all the ADU applications were
in the R-1 single family zone. The majority of applications filed (60%) were for sites in South
Palo Alto. Seven of the ADU applications were for new detached units and one was for a new
attached unit. The remaining applications were for conversions of garages and other accessory
spaces.

For this reporting quarter, the majority of the ADU applications were for one bedroom units.
The unit sizes ranged from 175 to 900 square feet, with an average unit size of 540 square feet.
There were two projects proposed utilizing the floor area bonus allowed under the City’s
ordinance. The City has not yet received an application for a Junior Accessory Dwelling Unit.
Additional details about the units reviewed and proposed are provided in the attached table
(Attachment A).

With the implementation of the State regulations in 2017, the City experienced a significant
increase in ADU permit activity; prior to this implementation there was an average of four ADU
permits per year. In the second quarter of 2018, the City received 20 ADU applications, bringing
the total for the calendar year to 26. Below is a summary of the ADU activity since the 2017
State regulations became effective.

ADU Code Updates

    Applications filed in 2016 and receiving Building Permit approval in 2017 are not included in this dataset.

  This category includes projects pending applicant resubmittals.

  The data in this report suggests ADU application processing times may be increasing and some of this may be
related to vacancies in the Planning department. While there are a variety of reasons why some applications take
longer to process than others, staff has initiated a review of completed and pending applications to learn if there
are administrative solutions to improve application processing times. Staff will report back on these findings for
the next quarterly report or sooner if able.

In May 2017, as part of the implementation of the local ADU regulations, the City Council
directed staff to review the newly effective regulations and identify potential amendments that
may be incorporated into a revised ordinance.

After conducting Study Sessions with both the PTC and City Council, staff prepared a draft
ordinance that was reviewed and recommended for approval by the PTC on April 25, 2018
(Report #91296). The City Council review of this ordinance is tentatively scheduled for August
20, 2018.
