# # Data Analysis of San Francisco Evictions
#%% [markdown]
# Currently, San Francisco and the Bay Area are struggling with a difficult housing crisis. We've all heard the stories of people living out of their RVs, people paying extorbitant rents to live in tiny apartments, and the growing prevalence of homeless people. While news outlets have covered the housing crisis extensively, San Francisco's Eviction Data may hold clues to aspects that have not yet been deeply reported in the news. 
# 
# Within the San Francisco Evictions data set, there are a number of data points we can examine. Most of the data points revolve around a reason for eviction, and our group decided to tackle the reasons in hopes of encountering interesting findings that could either challenge our assumptions about the housing crisis or affirm information we already had.

# In looking at all of the column headers of our data, we can see the full picture of all the information the San Francisco Government has collected.

We can identify this value as unique, and it will help us down the line when we need to identify how many evictions, along with other analysis moving forward.

# 
# If a row returns false for every eviction reason, it means they gave no eviction reason. For the table above, the only row with no eviction reasons is the first row. From this information we can reasonably conclude that in 321 evictions, the records cite no reason.
# To take that a step further, 321 evictions might have happened for no reason at all. In the context of a housing crisis, that number is unsettling. It is important to remember that this number is of all evictions from 1997 to 2017 - so the number of evictions per year with no reason given will be much less. It is also possible that within the eviction process, someone forgot to file the paper work and no reason was assigned to that particular case.

# ## Analysis
# 
# The table above shows the results of the code from a few lines ago. By scrolling all the way to the right, you can find the most important information in this data set. The frequency of records that have a true count for 'owner_move_in' is 10,018. Automatically, we learn that owner moveins are one of the highest reasons for eviction in San Francisco. This is interesting to think about because this piece of information brings up so many questions. Are the owners just moving in temporarily to fix up the place and then rent at higher rates? Are owners themselves having a hard time finding housing and thus have to resort to moving out their tenants? And, who are all those loud neighbors that made so much noise the owners had to move them out?
# Good data creates questions to investigate - and within each of these questions there is a potential story. 

#%%
#check what it looks like
#This line illustrates the reason variable - and it shows what eviction records with multiple reasons looks like
reasons.tail()

#%% [markdown]
# ## Analysis
# 
# Now at the tail end of the same table we looked at previously, we learn that there are evictions with multiple true counts, meaning there was more than one reason driving the eviction. Apparently, some of the eviction records have four reasons. Most of the records for San Francisco evictions only have one reason, so the finding that some eviction records have multiple reasons driving the eviction is a neat finding. Again, these data points just bring more questions that can turn into potential stories. It seems that the eviction records with more than one reason show that in some ways, allowances might have been given by some owners. Perhaps it shows an owner's willingness to try and work with their tenants. On the other hand, the fact that there are so few records with multiple reasons might actually give the opposite impression. Lastly, that data was not explicitly collected, and so there is no way to tell (except with further investigation, of course!)

All of this information is readable on the table above, but it is more quickly understood through this data visualization.

# ## Analysis
# 
# This chart illustrates the reasons for eviction by frequency in ascending order. It allows you to visualize immediately how much more breaches cause evictions over any other category and also shows that 'nuisance' while being a close second, is not necessarily that close behind. Although 'owner_move_in' is the highest reason for evictions overall, in 2018, it came in fourth. Also, 'breach' the reason with the most evictions was far ahead in driving evictions in 2018. This specific data points brings up many questions, such as: What is causing all of these breaches in renting contracts? Are there different breaches of contract that can be broken down into subcategories? And if so, what can those categories be? The reason the question of subcategories comes up for us is because the breaches in contract far outpaced any other reason for eviction in 2018, and it would be helpful to see what is actually behind those numbers.

# Here we have the same as above, a line chart that plots breaches as the reason for eviction over time. This chart reveals a finding that is not easily decipherable by looking at the raw data. Although Breaches are the top reason for eviction in 2018, eviction breaches have been much higher in past years. In 2015, San Francisco had almost double the amount of eviction for breaches that it had for 2018 - Surely there is a story there that can be uncovered with further research.

# This chart illustrates how 'owner_move_in' reasons for eviction have in some ways trailed off in the 20 year period illustrated by this graph.
# 
# ## Finding: 
# 20 years ago, evictions for owner move-ins peaked at 1400 evictions. In 2017, there's a little over 200. That is a significant drop. Potentially, this can mean that owners had the capital to not sublet or lease out apartments they owned, which in turn can allow them to move in. This could also highlight factors outside of our data such as how affordable it is to live in San Francisco - either way, this line chart shows a huge discrepancy in where owner move-in evictions are and where they were 20 years ago.

#%% [markdown]
# ## Analysis
# 
# Another Finding is that Nuisance evictions seem to stay relatively close to the same frequency - while owner move in and breaches are a bit more sporadic. The last interesting finding is that owner move ins for the late 1990s were pretty high - surely with more investigation, one could find an interesting story there. Lastly, looking at the 2007-2010 part of the graph, owner move-ins dipped -I think you can reasonably conclude that the financial crisis had an effect on that and had an effect on breaches of contract - as people likely struggled to pay their rent while facing layoffs and underemployment.
