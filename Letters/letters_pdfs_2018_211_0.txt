Background
1) Golf Course Reconstruction
On June 20, 2016 Council awarded contracts for the Golf Course Reconfiguration Project for a
total project cost of $13.5 million and adopted a resolution declaring the intent to reimburse
expenditures from tax-exempt certificates of participation (Report ID: 7032) in an amount not
to exceed $10.5 million The project was originally funded out of the Capital Improvement Fund
Infrastructure Reserve (IR). With the golf course reconstruction complete, it is time to access
public financing to reimburse the IR fund.

Typically, project bond financing is done when the project construction begins. In this instance,
the golf course financing was deferred in order to minimize financing and administrative
expense. Staff was planning for the possibility of financing the golf course renovation at the
same time as another project (the potential purchase of the Hamilton Avenue Post Office (PO)).
Combining the financing for both projects would have saved approximately $200,000 in legal,
financial and other bond issuance costs. After the Council determined not to purchase the PO
staff proceeded with a golf course only financing. The golf course financing will fund $8.2
million of the project costs. Outside revenue sources funded another $4.1 million, and the
remaining renovation costs of $1.2 million were funded by the IR. The outside revenue sources
include $1.1 million already received from the importation of soil and $3.0 million from the San
Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority (JPA) as a mitigation payment for impacts to the golf
course. The City has billed the JPA the $3 million. To date, we have received $0.5 million. The
JPA will pay the City the remainder after it receives grant reimbursements from the State
Department of Water Resources. As to the $1.1 million, on June 17, 2013, Council awarded a
contract to Don Tucker & Son (Report ID: 3827) for the importation and stockpiling of soil for
use on the Golf Course Reconfiguration Project. The contractor paid the City for the right to
stockpile 365,000 cubic yards of soil on the west side of the golf course. The soil importation
process, which was completed in late summer 2015, generated approximately $1.1 million.

Transformation of the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course into the Baylands Golf Link has been
achieved with a full course redesign by architect Forrest Richardson and construction by
Wadsworth Golf. The project included renovation of all 18 course holes, renovation of practice
chipping and putting greens, addition of a short game practice area, and addition of a youth
learning area. The course has changed from a flat and linear layout to a links style course with
some elevation changes providing views of the adjacent Baylands Preserve and San Francisco
Bay. The renovation project included all new irrigation lines, a new irrigation system, and a
pump station. Course construction is complete and the course is being prepared for a grand
opening in May 2018.

Design and construction of the new course incorporated the following green environmental
elements which will be highlighted in the preliminary official statement for the COPs:



City of Palo Alto                                                                          Page 2
        Transition from using a mix of potable and recycled water on the old course to using
         mostly recycled water on the new course by selecting paspalum, a salt tolerant grass.
        Paspalum goes dormant late fall and into early spring in the region, further reducing the
         need for irrigation.
        Reduction of maintained turf by 40% in comparison to the old course through course
         design.
        Most of this turf reduction is attributed to conversion from turf to native vegetation and
         wetlands. In total, there are 55 acres of vegetation and wetlands on a 141 acre golf
         course.
        7.4 acres of the previous golf course will be converted to in-stream marshland terrace
         habitat and used for flood protection by the adjacent levee expansion project.

2) Refinancing of 2002 Downtown Parking Improvements COP Bonds
In January 2002, the City caused $3.6 million of taxable certificates of participation (2002 COPs)
to be executed and delivered to finance construction of a two story building adjacent to the
Bryant/Lytton (parking) garage (Lot S/L). As a consequence of the weak economy prior to
construction, bids and the eventual construction costs for this building came in lower than
anticipated. In January 2005, these surplus proceeds of the 2002 COPs were used to defease
and eventually pay off $0.9 million principal amount of the 2002 COPs, resulting in annual
savings of $85,000. The 2002 COPs are payable from lease payments made by the City for use
and occupancy of the Civic Center. The City uses rental revenue from a commercial lessee
(Form Fitness) as a source of funds for the Civic Center lease payments.

Discussion
1) Golf Course Reconstruction
Council approval is required in order to sell an amount not to exceed $9.8 million in taxable
bonds through a negotiated sale process in May/June 2018. In a negotiated sale, the City is
assisted by its municipal (financial) advisor (Public Financial Management, Inc. (PFM)) in
preparing a request for proposal for underwriting services, receiving and evaluating bids,
selecting an underwriter, and in negotiating the sale based on the lowest interest cost to the
City. Underwriters are investment banking firms who resell the COPs to investors, typically
institutional investors like mutual funds. Since taxable municipal COP bonds are less commonly
used investment vehicles in the financial community and this issuance is considered small and
likely to garner less attention in the financial community, the City’s municipal advisor
recommends a negotiated sale to optimize the chances of a successful sale at the lowest cost to
the City.

The City’s municipal advisor sent out an underwriter’s request for proposals to 10 financial
firms. The RFP requested and the evaluation will consider a proposers willingness to give
residents priority in buying some of the COPs and the marketing these as “Green” bonds. Four
firms proposed. Two firms declined to submit a proposal, and four did not respond. At the time
of writing this report, staff and the City’s municipal advisor are evaluating the four proposals. A
finalist has not been selected.


City of Palo Alto                                                                            Page 3
Staff is recommending the execution and delivery of a single series of taxable COPs (the interest
with respect to the COPs when received by investors would be subject to federal income
taxation) because the IRS regulates the use of facilities that are financed with tax-exempt COPs
(the interest with respect to the COPs when received by investors would be exempt from
federal income taxation) that would restrict how the golf course management contract could
be structured which, over the 30 year life of the COPs, could pose operational challenges and
risks. For example, under a tax-exempt bond structure, the City’s ability to share the risk and
reward of golf course performance with the golf course operator would be significantly limited
because the IRS requires 50% of the compensation to be fixed regardless of how the golf course
performs. One advantage of taxable COPs is the ability to utilize incentive-based enterprise
compensation structures whereby the City can compensate the golf course operator primarily
on how well the golf course performs in the market. The terms of the three-year agreement
with golf course operator OB Sports, this is also scheduled before Council this evening, includes
a compensation structure that is permissible with either tax-exempt or taxable bonds.
However, staff recommends that the City utilize taxable COPs because it will provide flexibility
in the future, should the business and economic landscape change, to use a variety of
management agreement types, such as lease agreements and revenue share agreements.
Taxable COPs will allow the City, over the life of the taxable COPs, to enter into more financially
advantageous management compensation structures. The disadvantage of taxable COPs is that
the investors demand a higher interest rate than they would for tax-exempt COPs because the
investors’ interest income is taxable. The City’s municipal advisor estimates that taxable COPs
will increase the City’s interest cost when compared to tax-exempt COPs by approximately
$21,000 annually or $0.63 million over 30 years. Staff believes that, over 30 years, the
advantage of being able to negotiate incentive-based enterprise compensation agreements will
allow the City to share the risks and rewards of golf course performance with its course
managers and save the City more than $0.63 million. The Community Services Department
contracted with a golf management professional, James Keegan of Golf Convergence, who has
determined the golf course financial projections are reasonable and achievable starting with FY
2019, the first full year of operations of the reconfigured golf course. The projection forecast
covers all golf course expenses including the additional taxable financing costs.

If it adopts the attached resolution, the Council would delegate to the City Manager or a
designee appointed by the City Manager (e.g. Administrative Services Director) the
determination whether it is in the City’s best interests to finance all or a portion of the golf
course reconstruction project on a tax-exempt basis instead on the taxable basis that is being
recommended.

2) Refinancing of 2002 Downtown Parking Improvements COP Bonds
Staff is also recommending the refinancing of the 2002 COPs. Current outstanding principal on
the 2002 COPs is $0.8 million. The municipal advisor estimates that a refinancing of the 2002
COPs would produce present value (PV) savings of $269,500. The net present value (NPV)
savings is a modest $32,200 or 4.0 percent of outstanding bonds (net of all costs of issuing the


City of Palo Alto                                                                            Page 4
refunding). The main difference between the PV and NPV is the release of the current reserve
of $237,300. Investors in highly rated municipal securities, which we expect the COPs to be, do
not require the funding of a debt service reserve fund, which reduces the amount that the City
needs to finance. A debt service reserve represents one year’s debt service payment. The
General Fund and the Teen Program will be the beneficiary of the savings. There is another
advantage of refinancing the 2002 COPs: staff will be substituting collateral (most likely a City
fire station) with a market value closer to this COP bond issuance amount, in place of the
current collateral (the Civic Center). This will provide flexibility to leverage the high value of the
Civic Center to finance future infrastructure COP bond issuance (for example, public safety
building COPs).

3) Financing Structure and Related Documents
COPs are certificates that represent the right of investors to receive a share of a stream of
future lease payments to be made by the City. The City’s lease payments can be made from any
available source of funds (e.g. golf course revenues). The financing structure, which is similar to
past COPs issuances, will involve the following:

   a. The City will lease an asset, most likely Fire Station 1 (Leased Property), to a lease
      counterparty (Public Improvement Corporation) under a Property Lease (Attachment A-
      2). To utilize COPs as a financing vehicle, the City established a separate legal entity in
      1983, in this case a nonprofit corporation, the Palo Alto Public Improvement Corporation
      (Corporation). Members of the City Council are the Board members of the Corporation.

    b. The Corporation will lease the Leased Property back to the City under a Lease
       Agreement (Attachment A-3). The City will agree to make lease payments to the
       Corporation for use and occupancy of the Leased Property.

    c. The Corporation will assign certain of its rights under the Lease Agreement to a
       corporate trustee, in this case U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for the COPs
       (Trustee), pursuant to an Assignment Agreement (Attachment B-1). The assigned rights
       include the right to collect lease payments from the City and to enforce payment of the
       City’s lease payments.

    d. Pursuant to a Trust Agreement among the City, the Corporation and the Trustee
       (Attachment A-4), the Trustee will execute and deliver the COPs, which represent the
       right to receive a portion of the City’s lease payments. In this agreement, the Trustee is
       instructed to deposit the proceeds of the COPs into separate funds for construction and
       refinancing of the 2002 COPs, and it will also establish a fund for the City’s lease
       payments.

    e. The City will enter into a purchase agreement with an underwriter to purchase the COPs
       (Attachment A-5). The sale proceeds of the COPs will be used to: 1) finance the golf
       course renovation/reimburse the IR funds; and 2) refinance the 2002 COPs. The


City of Palo Alto                                                                               Page 5
         purchase agreement documents the conditions under which the underwriter will
         purchase the COPs.

    f. The underwriter will sell the COPs to investors. In order to market the COPs, the
       underwriter will distribute a Preliminary Official Statement (POS) (Attachment A-6). The
       POS is the offering document for municipal securities, in preliminary form, which does
       not contain pricing information. It is a disclosure of the finances surrounding the issue of
       the municipal bond, and is prepared by the legal (disclosure) counsel on behalf of the
       City. After the COPs have been sold to the underwriter, the City will prepare a final
       Official Statement, which should be identical to the POS except that it will include the
       final pricing information about the COPs, including principal amount, interest rate, and
       prepayment terms.

         The distribution of the POS by the City is subject to federal securities laws, including the
         Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These laws require the
         POS to include all facts that would be material to an investor in the COPs. Material
         information is information that there is a substantial likelihood would have actual
         significance in the deliberations of the reasonable investor when deciding whether to
         buy or sell the COPs. If the Council concludes that the POS includes all facts that would
         be material to an investor in the Obligations, it must adopt a resolution that authorizes
         staff to execute a certificate to the effect that the Preliminary Official Statement has
         been “deemed final.”

         The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the agency with regulatory
         authority over the City’s compliance with the federal securities laws, has issued
         guidance as to the duties of the Council with respect to its approval of the Preliminary
         Official Statement. In its “Report of Investigation in the Matter of County of Orange,
         California as it Relates to the Conduct of the Members of the Board of Supervisors”
         (Release No. 36761 / January 24, 1996) (the “Release”), the SEC stated that, if a member
         of the Council has knowledge of any facts or circumstances that an investor would want
         to know about prior to investing in the COPs, whether relating to their repayment, tax-
         exempt status (if applicable), undisclosed conflicts of interest with interested parties, or
         otherwise, he or she should endeavor to discover whether such facts are adequately
         disclosed in the POS. In the Release, the SEC stated that the steps that a member of the
         Council could take include becoming familiar with the Preliminary Official Statement
         and questioning staff and consultants about the disclosure of such facts.

         Appendix G to the POS is the Continuing Disclosure Certificate, under which the City will
         agree to provide certain financial and operating data of the type included in the POS to
         owners of the COPs on an annual basis, and information about certain enumerated
         events when they occur.




City of Palo Alto                                                                              Page 6
    g. Upon refinancing of the 2002 COPs, the City will cause a Termination Agreement
       (Attachment A-1) to be recorded in the Santa Clara County real property records in
       order to provide notice of the discharge of the 2002 COPs and the related financing
       documents. Terminating the financing documents will allow the City to utilize the Civic
       Center as a leased asset for future financings.

4) Approval of Documents
Staff from the Administrative Services, Community Services and Public Works departments and
the City Attorney’s Office has worked with the City’s municipal advisor (PFM), bond counsel
(Jones Hall) and disclosure counsel (Quint & Thimmig, LLP) to structure the financing and draft
the financing documents attached to this staff report. A ratings presentation to Standard and
Poor’s will occur on April 12th. Once the rating results are released, staff will report the results.
In addition, Community Services staff hired James Keegan of Golf Convergence to revisit the
financial pro-forma previously prepared to evaluate the current golf market conditions.

The following documents need the Council’s approval before the COP’s can be sold by a
negotiated sale in May/June 2018. The documents below are grouped according to actions that
the City Council must approve, and those that the City Council acting as the Board of Directors
of the Corporation must approve.

City Council Approval: Resolution Approving, Authorizing, and Directing Execution of Certain
Lease Financing Documents, Approving a Preliminary Official Statement, and Authorizing and
Directing Certain Actions with Respect Thereto (Attachment A).

The resolution authorizes the Mayor, City Manager, the Administrative Services Director/Chief
Financial Officer or their designee to sign and execute various documents, and to make any
changes to those documents that are minor in nature. Council is also approving as to form the
Preliminary Official Statement containing information material to the offering and sale of the
COPs. The documents staff will sign with Council’s approval are:

        Termination Agreement                (Attachment A-1)
        Property Lease                       (Attachment A-2)
        Lease Agreement                      (Attachment A-3)

Resource Impact
The COPs will fund $8.2 million of the golf course project costs. Outside revenue sources
funded another $4.1 million, and the remaining renovation costs of $1.2 million were funded by
the IR (Report ID: 7032). The outside revenue sources include $1.1 million already received
from the importation of soil and $3.0 million from the San Francisquito Creek JPA as a
mitigation payment for impacts to the golf course. The City has billed the JPA the $3 million; we
have received $0.5 million to date. Assuming a 30-year amortization period, an estimated True
Interest Cost (TIC) of 4.2 percent, and $9.0 million in bond proceeds, the estimated average
annual lease/debt service payment for the golf course COP over the first four years is $359,600
and the last 26 years is $517,400 and for the 2002 COP refinance, with a little over 4 years
remaining, is $158,700. The debt service along with the operating costs of the golf course will
be paid with operating revenues from the golf course. The 2002 COP refinance debt services
will be paid by the (Form Fitness) lease revenue.

Issuance costs (underwriter’s fees, bond and disclosure counsel fees, municipal (financial)
advisory fees, rating agency fees, municipal bond insurance premium, etc.) will be paid through
the sale of the COPs, in much the same way that closing costs are paid in a home sale escrow
process. The estimated issuance costs is $232,000 (cost breakdown is shown in Attachment C).

Policy Implications
The City’s debt policy states “the City will consider a refunding only when there is a net
economic benefit” and it also has a standard guideline of a net present value savings of at least
3 percent for initiating a refunding. The latter requirement is to provide a cushion for achieving
an economic benefit in the event interest rates increase more than anticipated and the
expected savings decline.

Approval of the 2002 COP bonds refinancing meets the net economic benefit requirement
(estimated NPV savings of $32,200) but is very close to the 3 percent guideline. However,
because the refinancing of the 2002 COPs will be combined with the financing of the golf course
reconstruction, the additional cost of issuance for the 2002 COPs refinancing is nominal and the
refinancing can be cancelled without any financial penalty should the economic benefit
disappear prior to these bonds being sold. Also, another major benefit of this refinancing is

City of Palo Alto                                                                           Page 8
substituting the existing Civic Center collateral with another City asset (expected to be Fire
Station 1) that has a market value closer to the combined golf course and 2002 COP principal
amount. This will provide flexibility in leveraging the high market value of the Civic Center for
future infrastructure financings (e.g. public safety building COPs, etc.).

Environmental Review
The financing proposed for approval is not a project under the California Environmental Quality
Act; therefore, an environmental review is not required. The City certified an Environmental
Impact Report (EIR) for the golf course reconstruction project.

                      A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY OF PALO ALTO
    APPROVING, AUTHORIZING AND DIRECTING EXECUTION OF CERTAIN LEASE FINANCING
   DOCUMENTS, APPROVING A PRELIMINARY OFFICIAL STATEMENT, AND AUTHORIZING AND
                 DIRECTING CERTAIN ACTIONS WITH RESPECT THERETO

                                            RECITALS
        WHEREAS, the Palo Alto Public Improvement Corporation, a nonprofit public benefit
corporation duly formed, organized operating and acting pursuant to the laws of the State of
California (the "Corporation") has heretofore leased the Palo Alto Civic Center to the City
pursuant to that certain lease agreement, dated as of January 1, 2002, by and between the
Corporation, as lessor, and the City, as lessee (the “2002 Lease”) for the purposes of refinancing
that certain lease agreement, dated as of March 1, 1992, by and between the Corporation, as
lessor, and the City, as lessee (the “1992 Lease”), refinancing certificates of participation
executed and delivered in the original amount of $7,670,000 (the “1992 Certificates”), and
financing the costs of certain Parking Structure Improvements, as defined in the 2002 Lease;

        WHEREAS, in order to provide funding for the foregoing objectives, the City
contemporaneously caused execution and delivery of (1) City of Palo Alto Certificates of
Participation (Civic Center Refinancing and Downtown Parking Improvements Project), Series
2002A (Tax-Exempt) in the original amount of $3,500,000 (the “2002A Certificates”) and (2) City
of Palo Alto Certificates of Participation (Civic Center Refinancing and Downtown Parking
Improvements Project), Series 2002B (Taxable) in the original amount of $3,555,000 (the
“2002B Certificates”) pursuant to that certain Trust Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2002
(the “2002 Trust Agreement”), by and among U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the
“2002 Trustee”), the Corporation and the City;

       WHEREAS, in order to take advantage of prevailing market conditions and realize
savings for the benefit of the City, the City now wishes to refinance its lease payment obligation
under the 2002 Lease and to cause the prepayment of the outstanding 2002B Certificates (the

        WHEREAS, the City further desires to finance the costs of making certain improvements
to the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course (the “Golf Course”), located at 1875 Embarcadero Road
(the “Golf Course Improvements”);

       WHEREAS, in order to refinance the 2002 Lease and the 2002B Certificates, and to

        WHEREAS, staff has recommended that the City cause the Certificates to be executed
and delivered in a single series the interest on which would be taxable under federal tax law in
order to preserve the maximum ongoing flexibility for Golf Course management; however, in
order to ensure that the financing is ultimately structured in the most cost-effective manner,
the City Council wishes to delegate to the City Manager or a designee appointed by the City
Manager (e.g. Administrative Services Director) the final determination of whether it is
desirable and in the City’s best interest to have the City cause to be executed
and delivered a second series of certificates of participation the interest on which would be
exempt from federal tax law to finance all or a portion of the Golf Course Improvements;

        WHEREAS, the City further proposes to lease its Fire Station 1, located at 301 Alma
Street (or another property identified by staff) (the “Leased Property”), to the Corporation
under a Property Lease by and between the City, as lessor, and the Corporation, as lessee (the
“Property Lease”), and to cause the Corporation to lease the Leased Property back to the City
under a Lease Agreement, by and between the City, as lessee, and the Corporation, as lessor
(the “Lease Agreement”), in consideration of the payment by the City of semi-annual lease
payments;

       WHEREAS, the City further proposes to cause the Corporation to assign its right to
receive such lease payments to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”),
under an Assignment Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”), by and between the
Corporation and the Trustee, and in consideration of such assignment the Trustee has agreed to
execute and deliver the Certificates, each evidencing a direct, undivided fractional interest in
such lease payments, in accordance with a Trust Agreement to be executed by and among the
Trustee, the City and the Corporation (the “Trust Agreement”);

       WHEREAS, in connection therewith, it is in the public interest and for the public benefit
that the City authorize and direct execution of the Lease Agreement and certain other financing
documents in connection therewith;

        WHEREAS, pursuant to Government Code Section 5852.1, which became effective on
January 1, 2018 by the enactment of Senate Bill 450, certain information relating to the
Certificates is set forth in Appendix A attached to this Resolution, and such information is
hereby disclosed and made public;

       WHEREAS, pursuant to the City's authorization, Quint & Thimmig LLP, as disclosure
counsel to the City, has prepared and presented to the City a form of preliminary official
statement containing information material to the offering and sale of the Certificates (the
"Preliminary Official Statement"); and

     WHEREAS, the documents below specified have been filed with the City, and the
members of the City Council, with the aid of its staff, have reviewed said documents.

               NOW, THEREFORE, the Council of the City of Palo Alto RESOLVES as follows:

desirable and in the City’s best interest for the City to cause to be executed and delivered
a second series of certificates of participation the interest on which would be exempt from
federal tax law to finance all or a portion of the Golf Course Improvements, either in lieu of or

hereby authorized and directed to execute such other agreements, documents and certificates
as may be necessary to effect the purposes of this resolution and the lease financing and

otherwise as appropriate, provided that any such corrections or additions shall be necessary to
cause the information contained therein to conform with facts material to the Certificates, or to

did not, on the date of sale of the Certificates, and does not, as of the date of delivery of the
Certificates, contain any untrue statement of a material fact with respect to the City or omit to
state material facts with respect to the City required to be stated where necessary to make any
statement made therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which it was
made. The Mayor, the City Manager or the Administrative Services Director shall take such

further actions prior to the signing of the Final Official Statement as are deemed necessary or
appropriate to verify the accuracy thereof.

         SECTION 9. The Final Official Statement, when prepared, is approved for distribution
by the Underwriter in connection with the offering and sale of the Certificates.

          SECTION 11. The Council finds that the adoption of this resolution does not meet the
definition of a project under Public Resources Code Section 21065, thus, no environmental
assessment under the California Environmental Quality Act is required.

       Leased Property that will remain following such removal is at least equal to the
       aggregate principal components of the unpaid Lease Payments, and that the useful life
       of the Leased Property is not less than the final payment date of the unpaid Lease
       Payments; and

             (d) The City shall obtain and cause to be filed with the Trustee and the
       Corporation an opinion of Bond Counsel stating that such removal is permitted
       hereunder and does not cause interest with respect to the Series 2018A Certificates to
       become includable in the gross income of the Series 2018A Certificate Owners for federal
       income tax purposes.




                                               -9-
       From and after the date on which all of the foregoing conditions precedent to such
removal are satisfied, the term of this Lease Agreement shall cease with respect to the property
which is so removed. The City shall not be entitled to any reduction, diminution, extension or
other modification of the Lease Payments whatsoever as a result of such removal.

      AGREEMENT TO LEASE; TERM OF LEASE AGREEMENT; LEASE PAYMENTS


       Section 4.1. Agreement to Lease. The Corporation hereby subleases the Leased
Property to the City, and the City hereby subleases the Leased Property from the Corporation,
upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease Agreement.

        Section 4.2. Term of Lease Agreement. The term of this Lease Agreement shall
commence on the Closing Date and shall end on May 1, 20[ ] unless such term is extended as
hereinafter provided. If on May 1, 20[ ], the Trust Agreement shall not be discharged by its
terms, then the term of this Lease Agreement shall be extended until the Trust Agreement shall
be discharged by its terms (but in no event beyond May 1, 20[ ]). If prior to May 1, 20[ ], the
Trust Agreement shall be discharged by its terms, the term of this Lease Agreement shall
thereupon end. The provisions of this Section 4.2 are subject to the provisions of Section 6.1
relating to the taking in eminent domain of the Leased Property or any portion thereof.

        Section 4.3. Lease Payments. (a) Obligation to Pay. Subject to the provisions of
Articles VI and X, the City agrees to pay to the Corporation, its successors and assigns, as rental
for the use and occupancy of the Leased Property hereunder during each Rental Period, the
Lease Payments (denominated into components of principal and interest) for the Leased
Property in the amounts specified in Exhibit A, to be due and payable on the Lease Payment
Dates specified in Exhibit A.

        Any amount held in the Lease Payment Fund on any Lease Payment Date (other than
amounts resulting from the prepayment of the Lease Payments in part but not in whole
pursuant to Article X and other than amounts required for payment of past due principal or
interest represented by any Certificates not presented for payment) shall be credited towards
the Lease Payment then due and payable; and no Lease Payment need be made on any Lease
Payment Date if the amounts then held in the Lease Payment Fund and available for such
purpose are at least equal to the Lease Payment then required to be paid. The Lease Payments
for the Leased Property payable in any Rental Period shall be for the use of the Leased Property
during such Rental Period.

       (b) Effect of Prepayment. In the event that the City prepays all remaining Lease
Payments, including any premium, if any, in full pursuant to Article X, the City's obligations
under this Lease Agreement shall thereupon cease and terminate, including but not limited to
the City's obligation to pay Lease Payments under this Section 4.3; subject however, to the
provisions of Section 10.1 in the case of prepayment by application of a security deposit. In the
event that the City purchases the Leased Property pursuant to Section 10.2, the amount paid
pursuant to Section 10.2 shall be credited entirely towards the prepayment in full or in part of
the Lease Payments. In the event that the City prepays the Lease Payments in part but not in
whole pursuant to Section 10.3 as a result of any insurance award or condemnation award with
respect to the Leased Property, such prepayment shall be credited entirely towards the
prepayment of the Lease Payments as follows: (i) the principal components of the remaining
Lease Payments shall be reduced on a pro rata basis in integral multiples of $5,000; and (ii) the


                                               -11-
interest component of the remaining Lease Payments shall be reduced by the aggregate
corresponding amount of interest which would otherwise be payable with respect to the
Certificates thereby prepaid pursuant to Section 4.01(A) of the Trust Agreement.

        (c) Fair Rental Value. The Lease Payments for the Leased Property for each Rental
Period shall constitute the total rental for the Leased Property during each Rental Period, and
shall be paid by the City in each Rental Period for and in consideration of the right of the use
and occupancy of, and the continued quiet use and enjoyment of the Leased Property during
each Rental Period. The parties hereto have agreed and determined that the total Lease
Payments for the Leased Property do not exceed the fair rental value of the Leased Property. In
making such determination, consideration has been given to the estimated value of the Leased
Property, the obligations of the parties under the Property Lease and this Lease Agreement, the
uses and purposes which may be served by the Leased Property and the benefits therefrom
which will accrue to the City and the general public.

        (d) Budget and Appropriation. The City covenants to take such action as may be
necessary to include all Lease Payments due hereunder in each of its budgets during the term of
this Lease Agreement and to make the necessary annual appropriations for all such Lease
Payments, except to the extent such Lease Payments are payable from amounts on deposit in
the Lease Payment Fund. During the term of this Lease Agreement, the City will furnish to the
Trustee a certificate that the Lease Payments due in the applicable Fiscal Year have been
included in the City's budget for such Fiscal Year within thirty (30) days after the adoption of
each budget. The covenants on the part of the City herein contained shall be deemed to be and
shall be construed to be duties imposed by law and it shall be the duty of each and every public
official of the City to take such action and do such things as are required by law in the
performance of the official duty of such officials to enable the City to carry out and perform the
covenants and agreements in this Lease Agreement agreed to be carried out and performed by
the City.

       (e) Assignment. The City understands and agrees that all Lease Payments have been
assigned by the Corporation to the Trustee in trust, pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, for
the benefit of the Owners of the Certificates, and the City hereby assents to such assignment.
The Corporation hereby directs the City, and the City hereby agrees to pay to the Trustee at its
Corporate Trust Office, all payments payable by the City pursuant to this Section 4.3 and all
amounts payable by the City pursuant to Article X.

        Section 4.4. Quiet Enjoyment. The Corporation shall provide the City with quiet use
and enjoyment of the Leased Property, and the City shall, for the remainder of the term of this
Lease Agreement, peaceably and quietly have and hold and enjoy the Leased Property, without
suit, trouble or hindrance from the Corporation, except as expressly set forth in this Lease
Agreement. The Corporation will, at the request of the City and at the City's cost, join in any
legal action in which the City asserts its right to such possession and enjoyment to the extent the
Corporation may lawfully do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall have
the right to inspect the Leased Property as provided in Section 7.2.

       Section 4.5. Title. During the term of this Lease Agreement, the City shall hold title to
the Leased Property and any and all additions which comprise fixtures, repairs, replacements or


                                               -12-
modifications to the Leased Property, including those fixtures, repairs, replacements or
modifications which are added to the Leased Property by the City at its own expense and which
may be removed without damaging the Leased Property and including any items added to the
Leased Property by the City pursuant to Section 5.8 hereof. Such title shall be governed by the
provisions of Section 3.04 of the Property Lease during the term of the Property Lease.

        If the City prepays the Lease Payments in full pursuant to Article X, or makes the
security deposit permitted by Section 10.1, or pays all Lease Payments during the term of this
Lease Agreement as the same become due and payable, all right, title and interest of the
Corporation under the Property Lease in and to the Leased Property (determined in accordance
with Sections 3.01 or 3.04 thereof) shall be terminated. The Corporation agrees to take any and
all steps and execute and record any and all documents reasonably required by the City to
consummate any such termination of leasehold estate.

        Section 4.6. Additional Payments. In addition to the Lease Payments, the City shall
pay when due, during the term of the Lease Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the
Corporation to comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement, including without
limitation all Costs of Issuance (to the extent not paid from amounts on deposit in the Costs of
Issuance Fund), compensation or indemnification due to the Trustee and all reasonable costs
and expenses of auditors, engineers and accountants.

        Section 4.7. No Merger. It is the express intention of the parties hereto that this Lease
Agreement and the obligations of the parties hereunder shall be and remain separate and
distinct from the Property Lease and the obligations of the parties thereunder, and that during
the term of the Property Lease no merger of title or interest shall occur or be deemed to occur as
a result of the position of the City as lessor under the Property Lease and as lessee hereunder, or
as a result of the position of the Corporation as lessee under the Property Lease and as lessor
under this Lease Agreement.

             MAINTENANCE; TAXES; INSURANCE; AND OTHER MATTERS


        Section 5.1. Maintenance, Utilities, Taxes and Assessments. Throughout the term of
this Lease Agreement, as part of the consideration for the rental of the Leased Property, all
improvement, repair and maintenance of the Leased Property shall be the responsibility of the
City, and the City shall pay for or otherwise arrange for the payment of all utility services
supplied to the Leased Property, which may include, without limitation, janitor service,
security, power, gas, telephone, light, heating, water and all other utility services, and shall pay
for or otherwise arrange for the payment of the cost of the repair and replacement of the Leased
Property resulting from ordinary wear and tear or want of care on the part of the City or any
assignee or lessee thereof. In exchange for the Lease Payments herein provided, the
Corporation agrees to provide only the Leased Property, as hereinbefore more specifically set
forth. The City waives the benefits of Section 1942 of the California Civil Code, and waives the
right to make repairs at the expense of the Corporation or in lieu thereof, vacate under Section
1942 of the California Civil Code, and all similar rights under the statues of similar effect, but
such waiver shall not limit any of the rights of the City under the terms of this Lease
Agreement.

        The City shall also pay or cause to be paid all taxes and assessments of any type or
nature, if any, charged to the Corporation or the City affecting the Leased Property or the
interests or estates therein; provided that with respect to special assessments or other
governmental charges that may lawfully be paid in installments over a period of years, the City
shall be obligated to pay only such installments as are required to be paid during the term of
this Lease Agreement as and when the same become due.

        The City may, at the City's expense and in its name, in good faith contest any such taxes,
assessments, utility and other charges and, in the event of any such contest, may permit the
taxes, assessments or other charges so contested to remain unpaid during the period of such
contest and any appeal therefrom unless the Corporation shall notify the City that, in the
opinion of Independent Counsel, by nonpayment of any such items, the interest of the
Corporation in the Leased Property will be materially endangered or any part thereof will be
subject to loss or forfeiture, in which event the City shall promptly pay such taxes, assessments
or charges or provide the Corporation with full security against any loss which may result from
nonpayment, in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Trustee.

        Section 5.2. Modification of Leased Property. The City shall, at its own expense, have
the right to remodel the Leased Property or to make additions, modifications and
improvements to the Leased Property. All additions, modifications and improvements shall
thereafter comprise part of the Leased Property and be subject to the provisions of this Lease
Agreement. Such additions, modifications and improvements shall not in any way damage the
Leased Property or cause it to be used for purposes other than those authorized under the
provisions of state and federal law; and the Leased Property, upon completion of any additions,
modifications and improvements made thereto pursuant to this Section, shall be of a value
which is not substantially less than the value of the Leased Property immediately prior to the


                                                -14-
making of such additions, modifications and improvements. The City will not permit any
mechanic's or other lien to be established or remain against the Leased Property for labor or
materials furnished in connection with any remodeling, additions, modifications,
improvements, repairs, renewals or replacements made by the City pursuant to this Section;
provided that if any such lien is established and the City shall first notify or cause to be notified
the Corporation of the City's intention to do so, the City may in good faith contest any lien filed
or established against the Leased Property, and in such event may permit the items so contested
to remain undischarged and unsatisfied during the period of such contest and any appeal
therefrom and shall provide the Corporation with full security against any loss or forfeiture
which might arise from the nonpayment of any such item, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation. The Corporation will cooperate fully in any such contest, upon the request and at
the expense of the City.

        Section 5.3. Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance. The City shall maintain
or cause to be maintained, throughout the term of this Lease Agreement, a standard
comprehensive general insurance policy or policies in protection of the Corporation, City, and
their respective members, officers, agents and employees. Said policy or policies shall provide
for indemnification of said parties against direct or contingent loss or liability for damages for
bodily and personal injury, death or property damage occasioned by reason of the operation of
the Leased Property. Said policy or policies shall provide coverage in the minimum liability
limits of $1,000,000 for personal injury or death of each person and $3,000,000 for personal
injury or deaths of two or more persons in each accident or event, and in a minimum amount of
$150,000 (subject to a deductible clause of not to exceed $250,000, or such higher amount as the
City shall determine, provided that such higher deductible shall be considered a self insured
retention) for damage to property resulting from each accident or event. Such public liability
and property damage insurance may, however, be in the form of a single limit policy in the
amount of $3,000,000 per occurrence covering all such risks. Such liability insurance may be
maintained as part of or in conjunction with any other liability insurance coverage carried by
the City. The proceeds of such liability insurance shall be applied toward extinguishment or
satisfaction of the liability with respect to which the proceeds of such insurance shall have been
paid.

         Section 5.4. Fire and Extended Coverage Insurance; Title Insurance. (i) The City shall
procure and maintain, or cause to be procured and maintained, throughout the term of this
Lease Agreement, insurance against loss or damage to any structures constituting any part of
the Leased Property by fire and lightning, with extended coverage and vandalism and
malicious mischief insurance. Said extended coverage insurance shall, as nearly as practicable,
cover loss or damage by explosion, windstorm, riot, aircraft, vehicle damage, smoke and such
other hazards as are normally covered by such insurance. Said insurance shall also cover loss or
damage to any portion of the Leased Property from earthquake; provided that the City shall
have no obligation to obtain earthquake insurance if such insurance is not commercially
available at a reasonable cost. Such insurance shall be in an amount at least equal to the greater
of (i) 100% of the replacement cost (without deducting for depreciation) of the Leased Property
and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Certificates at the time outstanding. Other than
earthquake insurance, such insurance may be subject to deductible clauses of not to exceed
$100,000 for any one loss. Earthquake insurance, if any, may be subject to deductible clauses of
not to exceed 10% of such replacement cost for any one loss. Such insurance may be maintained


                                                -15-
as part of or in conjunction with any other fire and extended coverage carried by the City. The
City hereby assigns to the Corporation all right of the City to collect and receive Net Proceeds
under any of said policies, which right has been assigned by the Corporation to the Trustee
pursuant to the Assignment Agreement. The Net Proceeds of such insurance shall be applied as
provided in Section 6.2(a).

       (ii) The City shall procure, and deliver to the Trustee on the Closing Date, a title
insurance policy which insures the leasehold estate created under this Agreement, in an amount
equal to the principal amount of the Certificates.

        SECTION 5.5. Rental Interruption Insurance. The City shall procure and maintain, or
cause to be procured and maintained, throughout the term of this Lease Agreement, rental
interruption or use and occupancy insurance to cover loss, total or partial, of the use of the
buildings, facilities and other improvements constituting any part of the Golf Course Project, as
a result of any of the hazards covered in the insurance required by Section 5.4, in an amount at
least equal to the maximum Lease Payments coming due and payable during any two
consecutive Fiscal Years during the remaining term of this Lease Agreement. Such insurance
may be maintained as part of or in conjunction with any other insurance coverage carried by the
City, and may be maintained in whole or in part in the form of the participation by the City in a
joint powers authority or other program providing pooled insurance; provided that such
insurance may not be maintained by the City in the form of self-insurance. The Net Proceeds of
such insurance, if any, shall be paid to the Trustee and deposited in the Lease Payment Fund,
and shall be credited towards the payment of the Lease Payments allocable to the insured
improvements as the same become due and payable.

         Section 5.6. Insurance Net Proceeds; Form of Policies. Each policy of insurance
required by Sections 5.4 and 5.5 hereof shall provide that all proceeds thereunder shall be
payable to the Trustee as and to the extent required hereunder. The City shall pay or cause to
be paid when due the premiums for all insurance policies required by this Lease Agreement.
All such policies shall provide that the Trustee shall be given thirty (30) days notice of each
expiration, any intended cancellation thereof or reduction of the coverage provided thereby.
The Trustee shall not be responsible for the sufficiency of any insurance herein required and
shall be fully protected in accepting payment on account of such insurance or any adjustment,
compromise or settlement of any loss agreed to by the Trustee. The City shall cause to be
delivered to the Trustee annually, on or before January 1 of each year, commencing January 1,
[2019], a certificate of the City that the insurance policies required by this Lease Agreement are
in full force and effect.

        Section 5.7. Advances. If the City shall fail to perform any of its obligations under this
Article the Corporation may, but shall not be obligated to, take such action as may be necessary
to cure such failure, including the advancement of money, and the City shall be obligated to
repay all such advances as soon as possible, with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per
annum from the date of the advance to the date of repayment.

        Section 5.8. Installation of City's Equipment. The City may at any time and from time
to time, in its sole discretion and at its own expense, install or permit to be installed other items
of equipment or other personal property in or upon the Leased Property. All such items shall


                                                -16-
remain the sole property of the City, in which neither the Corporation nor the Trustee shall
have any interest, and may be modified or removed by the City at any time provided that the
City shall repair and restore any and all damage to the Leased Property resulting from the
installation, modification or removal of any such items. Nothing in this Lease Agreement shall
prevent the City from purchasing or leasing items to be installed pursuant to this Section under
a lease or conditional sale agreement, or subject to a vendor's lien or security agreement, as
security for the unpaid portion of the purchase price thereof, provided that no such lien or
security interest shall attach to any part of the Leased Property.

        Section 5.9. Liens. The City shall not, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, encumbrance or claim on or with respect to
the Leased Property, other than the respective rights of the Corporation and the City as herein
provided and Permitted Encumbrances. Except as expressly provided in this Article, the City
shall promptly, at its own expense, take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge or
remove any such mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, encumbrance or claim, for which it is
responsible, if the same shall arise at any time. The City shall reimburse the Corporation for
any expense incurred by it in order to discharge or remove any such mortgage, pledge, lien,
charge, encumbrance or claim.

       Section 5.10. Compliance With Property Lease. During the term of the Property Lease,
the City will observe and perform all agreements and obligations on its behalf required to be
observed and performed thereunder. The City will not take any action or permit any action
within its control to be taken which constitutes or which, if not corrected, with the passage of
time or with notice, or both, would constitute or cause to occur any default under the Property
Lease.

     DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION AND EMINENT DOMAIN; USE OF NET PROCEEDS


        Section 6.1. Eminent Domain. If the Leased Property shall be taken permanently under
the power of eminent domain or sold to a government threatening to exercise the power of
eminent domain, the term of this Lease Agreement shall cease as of the day possession shall be
so taken. If less than all of the Leased Property shall be taken permanently, or if the Leased
Property or any part thereof shall be taken temporarily, under the power of eminent domain, (1)
this Lease Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall not be terminated by
virtue of such taking and the parties waive the benefit of any law to the contrary, and (2) there
shall be a partial abatement of Lease Payments as a result of the application of the Net Proceeds
of any eminent domain award to the prepayment of the Lease Payments hereunder, in an
amount to be agreed upon by the City and the Corporation such that the resulting Lease
Payments represent fair consideration for the use and occupancy of the remaining usable
portion of the Leased Property. The City covenants to contest any eminent domain award
which is insufficient to either: (i) prepay the Certificates in whole, if all of the Leased Property
is condemned; or (ii) prepay a pro rata share of Certificates, in the event that less than all of the
Leased Property is condemned.

       Section 6.2. Application of Net Proceeds. (a) From Insurance Award. The Net
Proceeds of any insurance award resulting from any damage to or destruction of the Leased
Property by fire or other casualty shall be paid to the Trustee, as assignee of the Corporation
under the Assignment Agreement, and deposited in the Insurance and Condemnation Fund for
application as set forth in Section 6.01 of the Trust Agreement.

        (b) From Eminent Domain Award. The Net Proceeds of any eminent domain award
resulting from any event described in Section 6.1 hereof shall be paid to the Trustee, as assignee
of the Corporation under the Assignment Agreement, and deposited in the Insurance and
Condemnation Fund for application as set forth in Section 6.02 of the Trust Agreement.

        Section 6.3. Abatement of Rental in the Event of Damage or Destruction. The amount
of Lease Payments shall be abated, during any period in which by reason of damage or
destruction (other than by eminent domain which is hereinbefore provided for) there is
substantial interference with the use and occupancy by the City of the Leased Property (other
than any portions of the Leased Property described in Section 5.2) or the Leased Property or any
portion thereof. The amount of such abatement shall be agreed upon by the City and the
Corporation such that the resulting Lease Payments represent fair consideration for the use and
occupancy of the portions of the Leased Property not damaged or destroyed. Such abatement
shall continue for the period commencing with such damage or destruction and ending with the
substantial completion of the work of repair or reconstruction. In the event of any such damage
or destruction, this Lease Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the City waives
any right to terminate this Lease Agreement by virtue of any such damage and destruction.
However, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 6.3, there shall be no abatement
of Lease Payments under this Section 6.3 to the extent that the proceeds of an eminent domain
or insurance award are available to pay Lease Payments, or to the extent that moneys are


                                                -18-
available in the Lease Payment Fund, it being hereby declared that such proceeds and amounts
constitute special funds for the payment of the Lease Payments.

                         DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; ACCESS


        Section 7.1. Disclaimer of Warranties. The Corporation makes no warranty or
representation, either express or implied, as to the value, design, condition, merchantability or
fitness for any particular purpose or fitness for the use contemplated by the City of the Leased
Property, or any other representation or warranty with respect to the Leased Property. In no
event shall the Corporation be liable for incidental, indirect, special or consequential damages,
in connection with or arising out of this Lease Agreement, the Property Lease or the Trust
Agreement for the existence, furnishing, functioning or City's use of the Leased Property.

        Section 7.2. Access to the Leased Property. The City agrees that the Corporation and
any Corporation Representative, and the Corporation's successors or assigns, shall have the
right at all reasonable times to enter upon and to examine and inspect the Leased Property. The
City further agrees that the Corporation, any Corporation Representative, and the Corporation's
successors or assigns shall have such rights of access to the Leased Property as may be
reasonably necessary to cause the proper maintenance of the Leased Property in the event of
failure by the City to perform its obligations hereunder.

         Section 7.3. Release and Indemnification Covenants. The City shall and hereby agrees
to indemnify and save the Corporation and its officers, agents, successors and assigns harmless
from and against all claims, losses and damages, including legal fees and expenses, arising out
of (i) the use, maintenance, condition or management of, or from any work or thing done on the
Leased Property by the City, (ii) any breach or default on the part of the City in the performance
of any of its obligations under this Lease Agreement, (iii) any act or negligence of the City or of
any of its agents, contractors, servants, employees or licensees with respect to the Leased
Property, or (iv) any act or negligence of any lessee of the City with respect to the Leased
Property. No indemnification is made under this Section or elsewhere in this Lease Agreement
for willful misconduct, negligence, or breach of duty under this Lease Agreement by the
Corporation, its officers, agents, employees, successors or assigns.

                       ASSIGNMENT, LEASING AND AMENDMENT


       Section 8.1. Assignment by the Corporation. The Corporation's rights under this Lease
Agreement, including the right to receive and enforce payment of the Lease Payments to be
made by the City under this Lease Agreement have been assigned to the Trustee pursuant to
the Assignment Agreement, to which assignment the City hereby consents.

        Section 8.2. Assignment and Leasing by the City. This Lease Agreement may not be
assigned by the City. The City may further lease any of the Leased Property or any portion
thereof, but only with the written consent of the Corporation and subject to all of the following
conditions:

             (i) This Lease Agreement and the obligation of the City to make Lease Payments
       hereunder shall remain obligations of the City;

              (ii) The City shall, within thirty (30) days after the delivery thereof, furnish or
       cause to be furnished to the Corporation and the Trustee a true and complete copy of
       such lease; and

              (iii) No such lease by the City shall cause the Leased Property to be used for a
       purpose other than as may be authorized under the provisions of the Constitution and
       laws of the State.

        Section 8.3. Amendment of Lease Agreement. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2)
below, without the prior written consent of the Trustee the City will not alter, modify or cancel,
or agree or consent to alter, modify or cancel this Lease Agreement, excepting only such
alteration or modification as may be permitted by Article IX of the Trust Agreement.

        (2) In addition, this Lease Agreement may be amended to obligate the City to pay
additional amounts of rental hereunder for the use and occupancy of the Leased Property or
any portion thereof, but only if (a) such additional amounts of rental do not cause the total
rental payments made by the City under the Lease Agreement to exceed the fair rental value of
the Leased Property, (b) the City shall have obtained and filed with the Trustee and the
Corporation an appraisal of the Leased Property showing that the estimated fair market value
thereof is not less than the aggregate unpaid principal components of such additional amount
of rental plus the existing aggregate unpaid principal components of the Lease Payments, (c)
such additional amounts of rental shall be pledged or assigned for the payment of any bonds,
notes, leases or other obligations the proceeds of which shall be applied to finance the
completion of public facilities and (d) the City shall send notification of the additional financing
to the rating agency then rating the Certificates.

                           EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES


       Section 9.1. Events of Default Defined. The following shall be "events of default"
under this Lease Agreement and the terms "events of default" and "default" shall mean,
whenever they are used in this Lease Agreement, with respect to the Leased Property, any one
or more of the following events:

             (i) Failure by the City to pay any Lease Payment when due and payable
       hereunder, or failure to pay any other payment when due and payable hereunder.

               (ii) Failure by the City to observe and perform any covenant, condition or
       agreement on its part to be observed or performed, other than as referred to in clause (i)
       or clause (ii) of this Section, for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice specifying
       such failure and requesting that it be remedied has been given to the City by the
       Corporation, the Trustee or the Owners of not less than twenty percent (20%) in
       aggregate principal amount of Certificates then outstanding; provided, however, if the
       failure stated in the notice can be corrected, but not within the applicable period, the
       Corporation, the Trustee and such Owners shall not unreasonably withhold their
       consent to an extension of such time if corrective action is instituted by the City within
       the applicable period and diligently pursued until the default is corrected.

              (iii) The filing by the City of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under Title 11 of
       the United States Code or any substitute or successor statute.

        Section 9.2. Remedies on Default. Whenever any event of default referred to in Section
9.1 hereof shall have happened and be continuing, it shall be lawful for the Corporation to
exercise any and all remedies available pursuant to law or granted pursuant to this Lease
Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein or in the Trust
Agreement to the contrary, there shall be no right under any circumstances to accelerate the
Lease Payments or otherwise declare any Lease Payments not then in default to be immediately
due and payable. Each and every covenant hereof to be kept and performed by the City is
expressly made a condition and upon the breach thereof the Corporation may exercise any and
all rights of entry and re-entry upon the Leased Property, and also, at its option, with or without
such entry, may terminate this Lease Agreement; provided, that no such termination shall be
effected either by operation of law or acts of the parties hereto, except only in the manner herein
expressly provided. In the event of such default and notwithstanding any re-entry by the
Corporation, the City shall, as herein expressly provided, continue to remain liable for the
payment of the Lease Payments and/or damages for breach of this Lease Agreement and the
performance of all conditions herein contained and, in any event such rent and/or damages
shall be payable to the Corporation at the time and in the manner as herein provided, to wit:

              (a) In the event the Corporation does not elect to terminate this Lease Agreement
       in the manner hereinafter provided for in subparagraph (b) hereof, the City agrees to
       and shall remain liable for the payment of all Lease Payments and the performance of all


                                                 -22-
conditions herein contained and shall reimburse the Corporation for any deficiency
arising out of the re-leasing of the Leased Property, or, in the event the Corporation does
not re-lease the Leased Property, then for the full amount of all Lease Payments to the
end of the term of this Lease Agreement, but said Lease Payments and/or deficiency
shall be payable only at the same time and in the same manner as hereinabove provided
for the payment of Lease Payments hereunder, notwithstanding such entry or re-entry
by the Corporation or any suit in unlawful detainer, or otherwise, brought by the
Corporation for the purpose of effecting such re-entry or obtaining possession of the
Leased Property or the exercise of any other remedy by the Corporation. The City
hereby irrevocably appoints the Corporation as the agent and attorney-in-fact of the City
to enter upon and re-lease the Leased Property in the event of default by the City in the
performance of any covenants herein contained to be performed by the City and to
remove all personal property whatsoever situated upon the Leased Property to place
such property in storage or other suitable place in the City of Palo Alto, for the account
of and at the expense of the City, and the City hereby exempts and agrees to save
harmless the Corporation from any costs, loss or damage whatsoever arising or
occasioned by any such entry upon and re-leasing of the Leased Property and the
removal and storage of such property by the Corporation or its duly authorized agents
in accordance with the provisions herein contained. The City hereby waives any and all
claims for damages caused or which may be caused by the Corporation in re-entering
and taking possession of the Leased Property as herein provided and all claims for
damages that may result from the destruction of or injury to the Leased Property and all
claims for damages to or loss of any property belonging to the City that may be in or
upon the Leased Property. The City agrees that the terms of this Lease Agreement
constitute full and sufficient notice of the right of the Corporation to re-lease the Leased
Property in the event of such re-entry without effecting a surrender of this Lease
Agreement, and further agrees that no acts of the Corporation in effecting such re-
leasing shall constitute a surrender or termination of this Lease Agreement irrespective
of the term for which such re-leasing is made or the terms and conditions of such re-
leasing, or otherwise, but that, on the contrary, in the event of such default by the City
the right to terminate this Lease Agreement shall vest in the Corporation to be effected
in the sole and exclusive manner hereinafter provided for in subparagraph (b) hereof.
The City further waives the right to any rental obtained by the Corporation in excess of
the Lease Payments and hereby conveys and releases such excess to the Corporation as
compensation to the Corporation for its services in re-leasing the Leased Property.

        (b) In an event of default hereunder, the Corporation may terminate this Lease
Agreement and re-lease all or any portion of the Leased Property. In the event of the
termination of this Lease Agreement by the Corporation in the manner hereinafter
provided on account of default by the City (and notwithstanding any re-entry upon the
Leased Property by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever or the re-leasing of the
Leased Property), the City nevertheless agrees to pay to the Corporation all costs, loss or
damages howsoever arising or occurring payable at the same time and in the same
manner as is herein provided in the case of payment of Lease Payments. Any surplus
received by the Corporation from such re-leasing shall be the absolute property of the
Corporation and the City shall have no right thereto, nor shall the City be entitled to any
credit in the event of a deficiency in the rentals received by the Corporation from the


                                        -23-
       Leased Property. Neither notice to pay rent or to deliver up possession of the premises
       given pursuant to law nor any proceeding in unlawful detainer taken by the
       Corporation shall of itself operate to terminate this Lease Agreement, and no
       termination of this Lease Agreement on account of default by the City shall be or
       become effective by operation of law, or otherwise, unless and until the Corporation
       shall have given written notice to the City of the election on the part of the Corporation
       to terminate this Lease Agreement. The City covenants and agrees that no surrender of
       the Leased Property or of the remainder of the term hereof or any termination of this
       Lease Agreement shall be valid in any manner or for any purpose whatsoever unless
       stated or accepted by the Corporation by such written notice.

       Section 9.3. No Remedy Exclusive. No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to
the Corporation is intended to be exclusive and every such remedy shall be cumulative and
shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Lease Agreement or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity. No delay or omission to exercise any right or power
accruing upon any default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver thereof, but any such right and power may be exercised from time to time and as often
as may be deemed expedient. In order to entitle the Corporation to exercise any remedy
reserved to it in this Article IX it shall not be necessary to give any notice, other than such notice
as may be required in this Article IX or by law.

        Section 9.4. Agreement to Pay Attorneys' Fees and Expenses. In the event either party
to this Lease Agreement should default under any of the provisions hereof and the
nondefaulting party should employ attorneys or incur other expenses for the collection of
moneys or the enforcement or performance or observance of any obligation or agreement on the
part of the defaulting party herein contained, the defaulting party agrees that it will on demand
therefor pay to the nondefaulting party the reasonable fees of such attorneys and such other
expenses so incurred by the nondefaulting party.

        Section 9.5. No Additional Waiver Implied by One Waiver. In the event any
agreement contained in this Lease Agreement should be breached by either party and thereafter
waived by the other party, such waiver shall be limited to the particular breach so waived and
shall not be deemed to waive any other breach hereunder.

       Section 9.6. Application of Proceeds. All net proceeds received from the re-lease or
other disposition of the Leased Property under this Article IX, and all other amounts derived by
the Corporation or the Trustee as a result of an event of default hereunder, shall be transferred
to the Trustee promptly upon receipt thereof, after payment of the fees and expenses of the
Trustee, including those of its attorneys, agents and advisors and shall be deposited by the
Trustee in the Lease Payment Fund, to be applied to the Lease Payments in order of payment
date.

        Section 9.7. Trustee and Certificate Owners to Exercise Rights. Such rights and
remedies as are given to the Corporation under this Article IX have been assigned by the
Corporation to the Trustee under the Trust Agreement, to which assignment the City hereby
consents. Such rights and remedies shall be exercised by the Trustee and the Owners of the
Certificates as provided in the Trust Agreement.

                            PREPAYMENT OF LEASE PAYMENTS




        Section 10.1. Security Deposit. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease
Agreement, the City may on any date secure the payment of Lease Payments by a deposit with
the Trustee of: (i) an amount of cash which, together with amounts on deposit in the Lease
Payment Fund and the Insurance and Condemnation Fund, is sufficient to pay all unpaid Lease
Payments, including the principal and interest components thereof, in accordance with the
Lease Payment Schedule set forth in Exhibit A, or (ii) Federal Securities together with cash, if
required, in such amount as will, in the opinion of an independent certified public accountant,
together with interest to accrue thereon and, if required, all or a portion of moneys or Federal
Securities then on deposit in the Lease Payment Fund and the Insurance and Condemnation
Fund, be fully sufficient to pay all unpaid Lease Payments on their respective Lease Payment
Dates or on any purchase option date as set forth in Section 10.2, as the City shall instruct at the
time of said deposit. In the event of a security deposit pursuant to this Section, all obligations of
the City under this Lease Agreement, and all security provided by this Lease Agreement for
said obligations, shall cease and terminate, excepting only the obligation of the City to make, or
cause to be made, Lease Payments from such security deposit, and title to the Leased Property
shall be affected thereby as described in Section 4.5. Said security deposit shall be deemed to be
and shall constitute a special fund for the payment of Lease Payments in accordance with the
provisions of this Lease Agreement.

        Section 10.2. Prepayment; Purchase Option. The City may exercise its option to prepay
the principal component of the Lease Payments, in whole or in part, on any date on or after [ ]
[ ], 20[ ], by paying a prepayment price equal to the aggregate or a portion of the unpaid
principal components of the remaining Lease Payments, together with the interest component
of the Lease Payment required to be paid on such date, and premium due, if any. The City shall
notify the Corporation and the Trustee as to which of the Lease Payments it wishes to prepay.
Such prepayment price shall be deposited by the Trustee in the Lease Payment Fund to be
applied to the prepayment of the Certificates pursuant to Section 4.01 of the Trust Agreement.
The City shall give the Trustee notice of its intention to exercise its option not less than forty-
five (45) days in advance of the date of exercise. In the event the Lease Payments have been
fully paid, and the City prepays the entire unpaid principal component of the Lease Payments
in whole, the City will be deemed to have purchased the Leased Property and title to the Leased
Property shall thereupon vest in the City, free and clear of any encumbrance created by this
Agreement.

       Section 10.3. Mandatory Prepayment. The City shall be obligated to prepay the Lease
Payments for the Leased Property, in whole or in part on any date, from and to the extent of any
Net Proceeds of insurance award or condemnation award with respect to the Leased Property
that have theretofore been deposited with the Trustee in the Lease Payment Fund for such
purpose pursuant to Article VI hereof. Such proceeds shall be applied to the prepayment of the




                                                -26-
principal component of the Lease Payments and the prepayment of the Certificates in
accordance with Article VI of the Trust Agreement.

       Section 10.4. Credit for Amounts on Deposit. In the event of prepayment of the
principal components of the Lease Payments in full under this Article X, such that the Trust
Agreement shall be discharged by its terms as a result of such prepayment, all amounts then on
deposit in the Lease Payment Fund shall be credited towards the amounts then required to be
so prepaid.

form of fully registered Certificates without coupons in the denomination of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, except that no Certificate may have principal maturing in more than

shall be designated by the Trustee.

       Interest represented by the Certificates shall be payable on each Payment Date to and
including the date of maturity or prepayment, whichever is earlier, as provided in Section 2.09.
Said interest shall represent the portion of Lease Payments designated as interest and coming


                                                -11-
due during the Rental Period (as defined in the Lease Agreement) preceding each Payment
Date. The proportionate share of the portion of Lease Payments designated as interest
represented by any Certificate shall be computed by multiplying the portion of Lease Payments
designated as principal represented by such Certificate by the rate of interest applicable to such
Certificate (on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months).

        Section 2.05. Form. The Certificates shall be substantially in the form set forth in
Exhibit A attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein.

         Section 2.06. Execution. The Certificates shall be executed by and in the name of the
Trustee by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Trustee. If any officer whose
signature appears on any Certificate ceases to be such officer before the date of delivery of such
Certificate, such signature shall nevertheless be as effective as if the officer had remained in
office until such date. Any Certificate may be executed on behalf of the Trustee by such person
as at the actual date of the execution of such Certificate shall be the proper officer of the Trustee.

        Section 2.07. Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer of Certificates. The registration of
any Certificate may, in accordance with its terms, be transferred upon the Registration Books by
the person in whose name it is registered, in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee,
accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form acceptable to the Trustee,
duly executed. Whenever any Certificate or Certificates shall be surrendered for registration of
transfer, the Trustee shall execute and deliver a new Certificate or Certificates of the same
maturity and aggregate principal amount of the same series, in any authorized denominations.

       (b) Exchange of Certificates. Certificates may be exchanged at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee, for a like aggregate principal amount of Certificates of other authorized
denominations of the same maturity and the same series. The City shall pay any costs of the
Trustee incurred in connection with such exchange, except that the Trustee may require the
payment by the Certificate Owner requesting such exchange of any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange.

         Section 2.08. Certificates Mutilated, Lost, Destroyed or Stolen. If any Certificate shall
become mutilated, the Trustee, at the expense of the Owner of said Certificate, shall execute and
deliver a new Certificate of like tenor and maturity in exchange and substitution for the
Certificate so mutilated, but only upon surrender to the Trustee of the Certificate so mutilated.
Every mutilated Certificate so surrendered to the Trustee shall be cancelled by it and
redelivered to, or upon the order of, the City. If any Certificate shall be lost, destroyed or stolen,
evidence of such loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the Trustee, and, if such
evidence is satisfactory to the Trustee and, if an indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee shall be
given, the Trustee, at the expense of the Certificate Owner, shall execute and deliver a new
Certificate of like tenor and maturity and numbered as the Trustee shall determine in lieu of
and in substitution for the Certificate so lost, destroyed or stolen. The Trustee may require
payment of an appropriate fee for each new Certificate delivered under this Section 2.08 and of
the expenses which may be incurred by the Trustee in carrying out the duties under this Section
2.08. Any Certificate executed and delivered under the provisions of this Section 2.08 in lieu of
any Certificate alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen shall be equally and proportionately


                                                 -12-
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with all other Certificates secured by this Agreement.
The Trustee shall not be required to treat both the original Certificate and any replacement
Certificate as being Outstanding for the purpose of determining the principal amount of
Certificates which may be executed and delivered hereunder or for the purpose of determining
any percentage of Certificates Outstanding hereunder, but both the original and replacement
Certificate shall be treated as one and the same. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2.08, in lieu of delivering a new Certificate in exchange for a Certificate which has been
mutilated, lost, destroyed or stolen, and which has matured, the Trustee may make payment
with respect to such Certificate upon receipt of indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee.

        Section 2.09. Payment. Payment of interest due with respect to any Certificate on any
Payment Date shall be made to the person appearing on the Registration Books as the Owner
thereof as of the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date, such interest to be
paid by check mailed to such Owner at his address as it appears on the Registration Books or at
such other address as he may have filed with the Trustee for that purpose. The principal,
interest and prepayment price represented by the Certificates at maturity or upon prior
prepayment shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America upon surrender
at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.

        Section 2.10. Execution of Documents and Proof of Ownership. Any request,
direction, consent, revocation of consent, or other instrument in writing required or permitted
by this Agreement to be signed or executed by Certificate Owners may be in any number of
concurrent instruments of similar tenor, and may be signed or executed by such Owners in
person or by their attorneys or agents appointed by an instrument in writing for that purpose.
Proof of the execution of any such instrument, or of any instrument appointing any such
attorney or agent, and of the ownership of Certificates shall be sufficient for any purpose of this
Agreement (except as otherwise herein provided), if made in the following manner:

               (a) The fact and date of the execution by any Owner or his attorney or agent of
       any such instrument and of any instrument appointing any such attorney or agent, may
       be proved by a certificate, which shall be acknowledged or verified, of an officer of any
       bank or trust company located within the United States of America, or of any notary
       public, or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds to be recorded in
       such jurisdictions, that the persons signing such instruments acknowledged before him
       the execution thereof. Where any such instrument is executed by an officer of a
       corporation or association or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation,
       association or partnership, such certificate shall also constitute sufficient proof of his
       authority.

              (b) The fact of the ownership of Certificates by any person and the amount, the
       maturity and the numbers of such Certificates and the date of his holding the same shall
       be proved by the Registration Books.

        Nothing contained in this Article II shall be construed as limiting the Trustee to such
proof, it being intended that the Trustee may accept any other evidence of the matters herein
stated which the Trustee may deem sufficient. Any request or consent of the Owner of any




                                               -13-
Certificate shall bind every future Owner of the same Certificate in respect of anything done or
suffered to be done by the Trustee in pursuance of such request or consent.

         Section 2.11. Registration Books. The Trustee shall keep or cause to be kept, at its
Corporate Trust Office, sufficient records for the registration and registration of transfer of the
Certificates, which shall at all times be open to inspection by the City and the Corporation; and,
upon presentation for such purpose, the Trustee shall, under such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe, register or transfer or cause to be registered or transferred, on the Registration
Books, Certificates as hereinbefore provided.

      Section 2.12. Use of Depository.           Notwithstanding any provision of this Trust

         (B) Prepayment From Net Proceeds of Insurance and Condemnation. The Certificates
are also subject to prepayment on any date, in whole or in part, from the Net Proceeds of
insurance or condemnation with respect to the Leased Property, which Net Proceeds are

Payments made by the City pursuant to Section 10.3 of the Lease Agreement, at a prepayment
price equal to the principal amount of the Certificates to be prepaid, together with accrued
interest to the date fixed for prepayment, without premium.

         Section 4.02. Selection of Certificates for Prepayment. Whenever provision is made in
this Agreement for the prepayment of Certificates and less than all Outstanding Certificates are
called for prepayment, the Trustee shall select Certificates for prepayment from the
Outstanding Certificates not previously called for prepayment, among maturities in integral
multiples of $5,000 and by lot within a maturity in any manner deemed appropriate by the
Trustee. For the purposes of such selection, Certificates shall be deemed to be composed of
$5,000 portions, and any such portion may be separately prepaid. The Trustee shall promptly
notify the City and the Corporation in writing of the Certificates so selected for prepayment.

       Section 4.03. Notice of Prepayment. When prepayment is authorized or required
pursuant to Section 4.01, the Trustee shall give notice of the prepayment of the Certificates.
Such notice shall specify: (a) that the Certificates or a designated portion thereof are to be
prepaid, (b) the date of prepayment, (c) the place or places where the prepayment will be made,
and (d) that the City has the right to issue a conditional redemption notice to the effect that the
redemption is conditioned upon receipt of sufficient funds to accomplish the redemption and to
rescind the notice as provided below. Such notice shall further state that on the specified date
there shall become due and payable upon each Certificate, the principal and premium, if any,
together with interest accrued to said date, and that from and after such date interest
represented thereby shall cease to accrue and be payable.




                                               -20-
        Notice of such prepayment shall be mailed by first class mail to the respective Owners of
Certificates designated for prepayment at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books,
at least thirty (30) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the prepayment date,
which notice shall, in addition to setting forth the above information, set forth, in the case of
each Certificate called only in part, the portion of the principal thereof which is to be prepaid;
provided that neither failure to receive such notice so mailed nor any defect in any notice so
mailed shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the prepayment of such Certificates.

        The City has the right to rescind any notice of the optional prepayment of Certificates
under Section 4.01(A)(1) by written notice to the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for
prepayment. Any notice of optional prepayment shall be cancelled and annulled if for any
reason funds will not be or are not available on the date fixed for prepayment for the payment
in full of the Certificates then called for prepayment, and such cancellation shall not constitute
an Event of Default. The City and the Trustee have no liability to the Owners or any other party
related to or arising from such rescission of prepayment. The Trustee shall mail notice of such
rescission of prepayment to the respective Owners of the Certificates designated for
prepayment at their respective addresses appearing on the Registration Books, and to the
Depository Trust Company and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.

         Section 4.04. Partial Prepayment of Certificate. Upon surrender of any Certificate
prepaid in part only, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Owner thereof, at the expense
of the City, a new Certificate or Certificates of authorized denominations equal in aggregate
principal amount to the unprepaid portion of the Certificate surrendered and of the same
interest rate and the same maturity.

         Section 4.05. Effect of Notice of Prepayment. Notice having been given as aforesaid,
and moneys for the prepayment (including the interest to the applicable date of prepayment
and including any applicable premium), having been set aside in the Lease Payment Fund, the
Certificates shall become due and payable on said date of prepayment, and, upon presentation
and surrender thereof at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, said Certificates shall be paid
at the unpaid principal amount (or applicable portion thereof) with respect thereto, plus interest
accrued and unpaid to said date of prepayment.

       If, on said date of prepayment, moneys for the prepayment of all the Certificates to be
prepaid, together with interest to said date of prepayment, shall be held by the Trustee so as to
be available therefor on such date of prepayment, and, if notice of prepayment thereof shall
have been given as aforesaid, then, from and after said date of prepayment, interest represented
by said Certificates shall cease to accrue and become payable. All moneys held by or on behalf
of the Trustee for the prepayment of Certificates shall be held in trust for the account of the
Owners of the Certificates so to be prepaid.

        All Certificates paid at maturity or prepaid prior to maturity pursuant to the provisions
of this Article IV shall be cancelled upon surrender thereof and destroyed.

Payment Fund pursuant to the Lease Agreement or pursuant hereto. All Lease Payments and
such other amounts to which the Corporation may at any time be entitled shall be paid directly

special fund designated as the "Lease Payment Fund", and within said Fund, the “Capitalized
Interest Account”. All moneys at any time deposited by the Trustee in the Lease Payment Fund

right or interest in the Lease Payment Fund or the moneys deposited therein, except only as

hereinafter set forth.

from the City or the Corporation.

       Section 5.04. Application of Moneys. All amounts in the Lease Payment Fund shall be

having been made to the satisfaction of the Trustee, shall be withdrawn by the Trustee and

         Section 6.01. Establishment of Insurance and Condemnation Fund; Application of
Net Proceeds of Insurance Award. The provisions of this Section are subject to Section 4.02 of

structure constituting any part of the Leased Property collected by the City in the event of any
such accident or destruction shall be paid to the Trustee by the City pursuant to Section 6.2(a) of
the Lease Agreement and deposited by the Trustee promptly upon receipt thereof in a special
fund to be established and held by the Trustee, designated as the "Insurance and Condemnation
Fund". If the City determines and notifies the Trustee in writing of its determination, within
ninety (90) days following the date of such deposit, that the replacement, repair, restoration,
modification or improvement of the Leased Property is not economically feasible or in the best
interest of the City, then such Net Proceeds shall be promptly transferred by the Trustee to the
Lease Payment Fund, and applied to the prepayment of Lease Payments pursuant to Section
4.01(B); provided, that such transfer shall only be made if the amount transferred is sufficient to
prepay the principal amount of Certificates attributable to the portion of the Leased Property
damaged or destroyed, determined on the basis of the ratio resulting from dividing the cost of
the portion of the Leased Property so damaged or destroyed by the total cost of the Leased
Property. All Net Proceeds deposited in the Insurance and Condemnation Fund and not so
transferred to the Lease Payment Fund shall be applied to the prompt replacement, repair,
restoration, modification or improvement of the damaged or destroyed portions of the Leased
Property by the City, upon receipt of Written Requests of the City stating with respect to each
payment to be made (i) the name and address of the person, firm or corporation to whom
payment is due, (ii) the amount to be paid and (iii) that each obligation mentioned therein has
been properly incurred, is a proper charge against the Insurance and Condemnation Fund, has
not been the basis of any previous withdrawal, and specifying in reasonable detail the nature of
the obligation, accompanied by a bill or a statement of account for such obligation. Any balance
of the Net Proceeds remaining after such work has been completed (as evidenced by a
Certificate of the City to the Trustee) shall be paid to the City. The preceding sentence
notwithstanding, before the remaining Net Proceeds are paid to the City by the Trustee, the
City shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate stating that the Leased Property has been replaced,
repaired, restored, modified or improved with the Net Proceeds to the extent that the City has
full use, occupancy and enjoyment of the Leased Property.

         Section 6.02. Application of Net Proceeds of Eminent Domain Award. The provisions
of this Section are subject to Section 4.02 of the Property Lease. If all or any part of the Leased
Property shall be taken by eminent domain proceedings (or sold to a government threatening to
exercise the power of eminent domain) the Net Proceeds therefrom shall be deposited with the
Trustee in the Insurance and Condemnation Fund pursuant to Section 6.2(b) of the Lease
Agreement and shall be applied and disbursed by the Trustee as follows:

              (a) If all of the Leased Property shall have been taken in such eminent domain
       proceedings or sold to a government threatening the use of eminent domain powers, or



                                               -24-
       if the City has given written notice to the Trustee of its determination that such proceeds
       are not needed for repair or rehabilitation of the Leased Property, the Trustee shall
       transfer such proceeds the Lease Payment Fund to be credited towards the prepayments
       of the Lease Payments required to be paid pursuant to Section 6.2(b) of the Lease
       Agreement and applied to the prepayment of Certificates in the manner provided in
       Section 4.01(B).

              (b) If less than all of the Leased Property shall have been taken in such eminent
       domain proceedings or sold to a government threatening the use of eminent domain
       powers, and if the City has given written notice to the Trustee of its determination that
       such proceeds are needed for repair, rehabilitation or replacement of the Leased
       Property, the Trustee shall pay to the City, or to its order, from said proceeds such
       amounts as the City may expend for such repair or rehabilitation, upon the filing of
       Written Requests of the City in the form and containing the provisions set forth in
       Section 6.01.

         Section 6.03. Cooperation. The Corporation and the Trustee shall cooperate fully with
the City at the expense of the City in filing any proof of loss with respect to any insurance policy
maintained pursuant to Article V of the Lease Agreement and, to the extent indemnified to its
satisfaction from any liability or expense related thereto, in the prosecution or defense of any
prospective or pending condemnation proceeding with respect to the Leased Property or any
portion thereof.

investment made pursuant to this Section 7.06.

or other applicable regulatory entity grant the City the right to receive brokerage confirmations
of security transactions as they occur, the City will not receive such confirmations to the extent
permitted by law. The Trustee will furnish the City periodic cash transaction statements which
include detail for all investment transactions made by the Trustee hereunder. The Trustee may
make any investments hereunder through its own bond or investment department or trust
investment department, or those of its parent or any affiliate. The Trustee or any of its affiliates
may act as sponsor, advisor or manager in connection with any investments made by the
Trustee hereunder.

        Section 8.01. Compensation of the Trustee. The City shall from time to time, as agreed
upon between the City and the Trustee, pay to the Trustee reasonable compensation for its
services, and shall reimburse the Trustee for all its advances and expenditures, including but
not limited to advances to, and fees and expenses of, independent appraisers, accountants,
consultants, counsel, agents and attorneys-at-law or other experts employed by it in the exercise
and performance of its powers and duties hereunder.

         Section 8.02. Removal of Trustee. The City and the Corporation may by written
agreement between themselves, or the Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
all Certificates Outstanding may by written request, at any time and for any reason, remove the
Trustee and any successor thereto, and shall thereupon appoint a successor or successors
thereto. Any such successor shall be a bank or trust company in good standing, duly
authorized to exercise trust powers and subject to examination by federal or State authority
having a combined capital (exclusive of borrowed capital) and surplus of at least Fifty Million
Dollars ($50,000,000). If such bank or trust company publishes a report of condition at least
annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of any supervising or examining authority
above referred to, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such
bank or trust company shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its
most recent report of conditions so published.

        The Trustee may at any time resign by giving written notice to the City and the
Corporation and by giving to the Certificate Owners notice by mailing such notice to the
registered owners of the Certificates. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the City shall
promptly appoint a successor Trustee by an instrument in writing; provided, however, that in
the event that the City does not appoint a successor Trustee within thirty (30) days following
receipt of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition the appropriate court
having jurisdiction to appoint a successor Trustee. Any resignation or removal of the Trustee
and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee. Upon such acceptance, the City shall mail notice thereof to the
Certificate Owners at their respective addresses set forth on the Certificate registration books
maintained pursuant to Section 2.11.

         Section 8.03. Appointment of Agent. The Trustee may appoint an agent to exercise
any of the powers, rights or remedies granted to the Trustee under this Trust Agreement, and to
hold title to property or to take any other action which may be desirable or necessary.

       Section 8.04. Merger or Consolidation. Any company into which the Trustee may be
merged or converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any company resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which it shall be a party, or any company to which the
Trustee may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business (provided that
such company shall be eligible under Section 8.02) shall be the successor to the Trustee without




                                                -28-
the execution or filing of any paper or further act, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

        Section 8.05. Protection and Rights of the Trustee. The Trustee shall be protected and
shall incur no liability in acting or proceeding in good faith upon any resolution, notice,
telegram, request, consent, waiver, certificate, statement, affidavit, voucher, bond, requisition or
other paper or document which it shall in good faith believe to be genuine and to have been
passed or signed by the proper board or person or to have been prepared and furnished
pursuant to any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement, and the Trustee shall be under no
duty to make any investigation or inquiry as to any statements contained or matters referred to
in any such instrument, but may accept and rely upon the same as conclusive evidence of the
truth and accuracy of such statements. The Trustee may consult with counsel, who may be
counsel to the Corporation, with regard to legal questions, and the opinion of such counsel shall
be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it
hereunder in good faith in accordance therewith.

         Whenever in the administration of its duties under this Trust Agreement, the Trustee
shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or
suffering any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein
specifically prescribed), shall be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by the
certificate of the City Representative or the Corporation Representative and such certificate
shall be full warranty to the Trustee for any action taken or suffered under the provisions of this
Trust Agreement upon the faith thereof, but in its discretion the Trustee may, in lieu thereof,
accept other evidence of such matter or may require such additional evidence as to it may seem
reasonable.

        The Trustee may become the Owner of the Certificates with the same rights it would
have if it were not the Trustee; may acquire and dispose of other bonds or evidences of
indebtedness of the City with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee; and may
act as a depositary for and permit any of its officers or directors to act as a member of, or in any
other capacity with respect to, any committee formed to protect the rights of Owners of
Certificates, whether or not such committee shall represent the Owners of the majority in
principal amount of the Certificates then Outstanding.

        The recitals, statements and representations by the City and the Corporation contained
in this Trust Agreement or in the Certificates shall be taken and construed as made by and on
the part of the City and the Corporation, as the case may be, and not by the Trustee, and the
Trustee does not assume, and shall not have, any responsibility or obligation for the correctness
of any thereof.

        The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereof and perform the duties
required of it hereunder by or through attorneys, agents, or receivers, and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel concerning all matters of trust and its duty hereunder, and the Trustee shall
not be answerable for the default or misconduct of any such attorney, agent, or receiver selected
by it with reasonable care. The Trustee shall not be answerable for the exercise of any discretion
or power under this Trust Agreement or for anything whatever in connection with the funds




                                                -29-
and accounts established hereunder, except only for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

       The Trustee shall be responsible to perform only those duties specifically set forth herein
and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Trustee.

         The Trustee shall have no responsibility with respect to any information, statement, or
recital in any official statement, offering memorandum or any other disclosure material
prepared or distributed with respect to the Certificates.

       The Trustee is authorized and directed to execute in its capacity as Trustee the
Assignment Agreement.

        The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of an Event of Default hereunder
unless it shall have actual knowledge at its Corporate Trust Office.

       No provision of this Trust Agreement or any other document related hereto shall require
the Trustee to risk or advance its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of its duties or the exercise of its rights hereunder.

        Before taking any action under Article XII hereof the Trustee may require indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee be furnished from any expenses and to protect it against any liability
it may incur hereunder.

       The immunities extended to the Trustee also extend to its directors, officers, employees
and agents.

       The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with
the direction of a majority (or other percentage provided for herein) in aggregate principal
amount of Certificates outstanding relating to the exercise of any right, power or remedy
available to the Trustee.

        The permissive right of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Trust Agreement
shall not be construed as a duty.

       Every provision of this Trust Agreement, the Lease Agreement, the Property Lease and
the Assignment Agreement relating to the conduct or liability of the Trustee shall be subject to
the provisions of this Trust Agreement, including without limitation, this Article.

        In acting as Trustee hereunder, the Trustee acts solely in its capacity as Trustee
hereunder and not in its individual or personal capacity, and all persons, including without
limitation the Owners, the City and the Corporation, having any claim against the Trustee shall
look only to the funds and accounts held by the Trustee hereunder for payment, except as
otherwise provided herein. Under no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable in its individual
or personal capacity for the obligations evidenced by the Certificates.




                                               -30-
       The Trustee makes no representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the
value, design, condition, merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose or fitness for the
use contemplated by the City or the Corporation of the project or any portion thereof, or any
other representation or warranty with respect to the Property or any portion thereof. In no
event shall the Trustee be liable for incidental, indirect, special or consequential damages in
connection with this Trust Agreement, the Lease Agreement or the Property Lease or the
existence, furnishing or functioning of the Property or the City’s use of the Leased Property.

                   MODIFICATION OR AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT


         Section 9.01. Amendments Permitted. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
of the parties hereto and the Lease Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties
thereto, may be modified or amended at any time by a supplemental agreement which shall
become effective when the written consents of the Owners of at least sixty percent (60%) in
aggregate principal amount of the Certificates then Outstanding, exclusive of Certificates
disqualified as provided in Section 9.03, shall have been filed with the Trustee. No such
modification or amendment shall (1) extend or have the effect of extending the fixed maturity of
any Certificate or reducing the interest rate with respect thereto or extending the time of
payment of interest, or reducing the amount of principal thereof or reducing any premium
payable upon the prepayment thereof, without the express consent of the Owner of such
Certificate, or (2) reduce or have the effect of reducing the percentage of Certificates required
for the affirmative vote or written consent to an amendment or modification of the Lease
Agreement, or (3) modify any of the rights or obligations of the Trustee without its written
assent thereto. Any such supplemental agreement shall become effective as provided in Section
9.02.

       This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto and the Lease
Agreement and the rights and obligations of the respective parties thereto, may be modified or
amended at any time by a supplemental agreement, without the consent of any such Owners,
but only to the extent permitted by law and only (1) to add to the covenants and agreements of
any party, other covenants to be observed, or to surrender any right or power herein or therein
reserved to the City, (2) to cure, correct or supplement any ambiguous or defective provision
contained herein or therein so long as such modification or amendment is not inconsistent with
any other provision contained herein, (3) in regard to questions arising hereunder or
thereunder, as the parties hereto or thereto may deem necessary or desirable and which shall
not adversely affect the interests of the Owners of the Certificates or (4) to correct any incorrect
property description. Any such supplemental agreement shall become effective upon execution
and delivery by the parties hereto or thereto as the case may be.

        Section 9.02. Procedure for Amendment with Written Consent of Certificate Owners.
This Agreement and the Lease Agreement may be amended by supplemental agreement as
provided in this Section 9.02 in the event the consent of the Owners of the Certificates is
required pursuant to Section 9.01. A copy of such supplemental agreement, together with a
request to the Certificate Owners for their consent thereto, shall be mailed by the Trustee to
each Owner of a Certificate at his address as set forth on the Registration Books, but failure to
receive copies of such supplemental agreement and request shall not affect the validity of the
supplemental agreement when assented to as in this Section provided.

       Such supplemental agreement shall not become effective unless there shall be filed with
the Trustee the written consents of the Owners of at least sixty percent (60%) in aggregate
principal amount of the Certificates then Outstanding (exclusive of Certificates disqualified as
provided in Section 9.03) and a notice shall have been mailed as hereinafter in this Section



                                                -32-
provided. Each such consent shall be effective only if accompanied by proof of ownership of
the Certificates for which such consent is given, which proof shall be such as is permitted by
Section 2.10. Any such consent shall be binding upon the Owner of the Certificate giving such
consent and on any subsequent Owner (whether or not such subsequent Owner has notice
thereof) unless such consent is revoked in writing by the Owner giving such consent or a
subsequent Owner by filing such revocation with the Trustee prior to the date when the notice
hereinafter in this Section provided for has been mailed.

        After the Owners of the required percentage of Certificates shall have filed their
consents to such supplemental agreement, the Trustee shall mail a notice to the Owners of the
Certificates in the manner hereinbefore provided in this Section for the mailing of such
supplemental agreement of the notice of adoption thereof, stating in substance that such
supplemental agreement has been consented to by the Owners of the required percentage of
Certificates and will be effective as provided in this Section (but failure to receive copies of said
notice shall not affect the validity of such supplemental agreement or consents thereto). A
record, consisting of the papers required by this Section to be filed with the Trustee, shall be
conclusive proof of the matters therein stated. Such supplemental agreement shall become
effective upon the mailing of such last-mentioned notice, and such supplemental agreement
shall be deemed conclusively binding upon the parties hereto and the Owners of all Certificates
at the expiration of sixty (60) days after such mailing, except in the event of a final decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction setting aside such consent in a legal action or equitable
proceeding for such purpose commenced within such sixty (60) day period.

        Section 9.03. Disqualified Certificates. Certificates owned or held by or for the
account of the City or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or under
direct or indirect common control with the City (except any Certificates held in any pension or
retirement fund) shall not be deemed Outstanding for the purpose of any vote, consent, waiver
or other action or any calculation of Outstanding Certificates provided for in this Agreement,
and shall not be entitled to vote upon, consent to, or take any other action provided for in this
Agreement.

        Section 9.04. Effect of Supplemental Agreement. From and after the time any
supplemental agreement becomes effective pursuant to this Article IX, this Agreement or the
Lease Agreement, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be modified and amended in
accordance therewith, the respective rights, duties and obligations of the parties hereto or
thereto and all Owners of Certificates Outstanding, as the case may be, shall thereafter be
determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modification and
amendment, and all the terms and conditions of any supplemental agreement shall be deemed
to be part of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Lease Agreement, as the case
may be, for any and all purposes.

        The Trustee may require each Certificate Owner, before his consent provided for in this
Article IX shall be deemed effective, to reveal whether the Certificates as to which such consent
is given are disqualified as provided in Section 9.03.

     Section 9.05.  Endorsement or Replacement of Certificates Delivered After
Amendments. The Trustee or the City may determine that Certificates delivered after the


                                                -33-
effective date of any action taken as provided in this Article IX shall bear a notation, by
endorsement or otherwise, in form approved by the City, as to such action. In that case, upon
demand of the Owner of any Certificate Outstanding at such effective date and presentation of
his Certificate for the purpose at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, a suitable notation
shall be made on such Certificate. The Trustee or the City may determine that the delivery of
substitute Certificates, so modified as in the opinion of the Trustee is necessary to conform to
such Certificate Owners" action, which substitute Certificates shall thereupon be prepared,
executed and delivered. In that case, upon demand of the Owner of any Certificate then
Outstanding, such substitute Certificate shall be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee, without cost to such Owner, for a Certificate of the same character then Outstanding,
upon surrender of such Outstanding Certificate.

         Section 9.06. Amendatory Endorsement of Certificates. The provisions of this Article
IX shall not prevent any Certificate Owner from accepting any amendment as to the particular
Certificates held by him, provided that proper notation thereof is made on such Certificates.

covenants and agrees with the Owners of the Certificates to perform all obligations and duties
imposed on it under the Lease Agreement. The Corporation covenants and agrees with the
Owners of the Certificates to perform all obligations and duties imposed on it under the Lease
Agreement.

        The City will not do or permit anything to be done, or omit or refrain from doing
anything, in any case where any such act done or permitted to be done, or any such omission of
or refraining from action, would or might be an Event of Default under or a ground for
cancellation or termination of the Lease Agreement. The Corporation and the City,
immediately upon receiving or giving any notice, communication or other document in any
way relating to or affecting their respective estates, or either of them, in the Leased Property,
which may or can in any manner affect such estate of the City, will deliver the same, or a copy
thereof, to the Trustee.

        Section 10.02. Prosecution and Defense of Suits. The Corporation and the City shall
promptly, upon request of the Trustee or any Certificate Owner, from time to time take such
action as may be necessary or proper to remedy or cure any defect in or cloud upon the title to
the Leased Property, whether now existing or hereafter developing and shall prosecute all such
suits, actions and other proceedings as may be appropriate for such purpose and shall
indemnify and save the Trustee and every Certificate Owner harmless from all loss, cost,
damage and expense, including attorneys’ fees, which they or any of them may incur by reason
of any such defect, cloud, suit, action or proceeding.

        Section 10.03. Recordation and Filing. The City shall record and file the Lease
Agreement, the Assignment Agreement and all such documents as may be required by law
(and shall take all further actions which may be necessary or be reasonably required by the
Trustee), all in such manner, at such times and in such places as may be required by law in
order fully to preserve, protect and perfect the security of the Trustee and the Certificate
Owners.

        Section 10.04. Reserved.

         Section 10.05. Continuing Disclosure. The City hereby covenants and agrees that it
will comply with and carry out all of the provisions of that certain Continuing Disclosure
Certificate executed by the City as of the Closing Date, as originally executed and as it may be
amended from time to time in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Lease, failure of the City to comply with such Continuing Disclosure Certificate shall not
constitute an Event of Default; provided, however, that any Participating Underwriter (as such
term is defined in such Continuing Disclosure Certificate ) or any Owner or beneficial owner of
the Certificates may take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate to compel




                                               -35-
performance by the City of its obligations under this Section, including seeking mandate or
specific performance by court order.

       Section 10.06. Further Assurances. The Corporation and the City will make, execute
and deliver any and all such further resolutions, instruments and assurances as may be
reasonably necessary or proper to carry out the intention or to facilitate the performance of this
Agreement and the Lease Agreement, and for the better assuring and confirming unto the
Owners of the Certificates the rights and benefits provided herein.

                                 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY


         Section 11.01. Limited Liability of City. Except for the payment of Lease Payments
when due in accordance with the Lease Agreement and the performance of the other covenants
and agreements of the City contained in the Lease Agreement and herein, the City shall have no
pecuniary obligation or liability to any of the other parties or to the Owners of the Certificates
with respect to this Trust Agreement or the terms, execution, delivery or transfer of the
Certificates, or the distribution of Lease Payments to the Owners by the Trustee.

        Section 11.02. No Liability for Trustee Performance. Neither the City nor the
Corporation shall have any obligation or liability to any of the other parties or to the Owners of
the Certificates with respect to the performance by the Trustee of any duty imposed upon it

given specific direction to the Trustee to take certain actions.

        Section 11.03. Indemnification. The Corporation and the City agree to indemnify and
save the Trustee harmless from and against all claims, suits, losses, expenses, liabilities, and
actions brought against it, or to which it is made a party, and from all losses and damages
suffered by it as a result thereof, including where and to the extent such claim, suit or action
arises out of the actions of any other party to this Agreement including but not limited to the
ownership, operation or use of the Leased Property by the City. Such indemnification shall not
extend to claims, suits and actions brought against the Trustee for failure to perform and carry
out the duties specifically imposed upon and to be performed by it pursuant to this Trust
Agreement, which failure constitutes negligence or willful misconduct by the Trustee. Such
indemnity shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Trust Agreement or resignation or
removal of the Trustee. In the event the Corporation or the City is required to indemnify the
Trustee as herein provided, the Corporation or the City shall be subrogated to the rights of the
Trustee to recover such losses or damages from any other person or entity.

        Section 11.04. Opinion of Counsel. Before being required to take any action, the
Trustee may require an opinion of Independent Counsel acceptable to the Trustee, which

concerning the proposed action. If it does so in good faith, Trustee shall be protected in relying
thereon.

         Section 11.05. Limitation of Rights to Parties and Certificate Owners. Nothing in this
Agreement or in the Certificates expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to give
any person other than the City, the Corporation, the Trustee, the Owners of the Certificates, any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any covenant,
condition or provision hereof; and all such covenants, conditions and provisions are and shall

           EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES OF CERTIFICATE OWNERS


         Section 12.01. Assignment of Rights. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement the
Corporation has transferred, assigned and set over to the Trustee all of the Corporation's rights
in and to the Lease Agreement (excepting only the Corporation's rights under Sections 4.6, 5.7,
7.3 and 9.4 thereof), including without limitation all of the Corporation's rights to exercise such
rights and remedies conferred on the Corporation pursuant to the Lease Agreement as may be
necessary or convenient (i) to enforce payment of the Lease Payments and any other amounts
required to be deposited in the Lease Payment Fund or the Insurance and Condemnation Fund,
and (ii) otherwise to exercise the Corporation's rights and take any action to protect the interests
of the Trustee or the Certificate Owners in an Event of Default.

        Section 12.02. Remedies. If an Event of Default shall happen, then and in each and
every such case during the continuance of such Event of Default, the Trustee may, and upon
request of the Owners as provided in Article IX of the Lease Agreement shall, exercise any and
all remedies available pursuant to law or granted pursuant to the Lease Agreement; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything herein or in the Lease Agreement to the contrary, there
shall be no right under any circumstances to accelerate the maturities of the Certificates or
otherwise to declare any Lease Payment not then in default to be immediately due and payable.

        Section 12.03. Application of Funds. All moneys received by the Trustee pursuant to
any right given or action taken under the provisions of this Article XII or Article IX of the Lease
Agreement shall be applied by the Trustee in the order following upon presentation of the
several Certificates, and the stamping thereon of the payment if only partially paid, or upon the
surrender thereof if fully paid -

               First, to the payment of the costs and expenses of the Trustee and of the
       Certificate Owners in declaring such Event of Default, including reasonable
       compensation to its or their agents, attorneys and counsel;

               Second, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid with
       respect to the Certificates for principal and interest, with interest on the overdue
       principal and installments of interest, and in case such moneys shall be insufficient to
       pay in full the whole amount so owing and unpaid with respect to the Certificates, then
       to the payment of such principal and interest without preference or priority of principal
       over interest, or of interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other
       installment of interest, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and interest.

       Section 12.04. Institution of Legal Proceedings. If one or more Events of Default shall
happen and be continuing, the Trustee in its discretion may, and upon the written request of the
Owners of a majority in principal amount of the Certificates then Outstanding, and upon being
indemnified to its satisfaction therefor, shall, proceed to protect or enforce its rights or the rights
of the Owners of Certificates by a suit in equity or action at law, either for the specific
performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein, or in aid of the execution of any


                                                 -38-
power herein granted, or by mandamus or other appropriate proceeding for the enforcement of
any other legal or equitable remedy as the Trustee shall deem most effectual in support of any
of its rights or duties hereunder.

         Section 12.05. Non-waiver. Nothing in this Article XII or in any other provision of this
Agreement or in the Certificates, shall affect or impair the obligation of the City to pay or
prepay the Lease Payments in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of the
Lease Agreement, or affect or impair the right of action, which is also absolute and
unconditional, of the Certificate Owners to institute suit to enforce and collect such payment.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Owner of any of the Certificates to exercise any
right or power arising upon the happening of any Event of Default shall impair any such right
or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein, and every power and remedy given by this Article XII to the Trustee or to the Owners
of Certificates may be exercised from time to time and as often as shall be deemed expedient by
the Trustee or the Certificate Owners.

        Section 12.06. Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved
to the Trustee or to the Certificate Owners is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and
every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing, at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

         Section 12.07. Power of Trustee to Control Proceedings. In the event that the Trustee,
upon the happening of an Event of Default, shall have taken any action, by judicial proceedings
or otherwise, pursuant to its duties hereunder, whether upon its own discretion or upon the
request of the Owners of a majority in principal amount of the Certificates then Outstanding, it
shall have full power, in the exercise of its discretion for the best interests of the Owners of the
Certificates, with respect to the continuance, discontinuance, withdrawal, compromise,
settlement or other disposal of such action; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not
discontinue, withdraw, compromise or settle, or otherwise dispose of any litigation pending at
law or in equity, without the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Certificates Outstanding.

         Section 12.08. Limitation on Certificate Owners' Right to Sue. No Owner of any
Certificate executed and delivered hereunder shall have the right to institute any suit, action or
proceeding at law or in equity, for any remedy under or upon this Agreement, unless (a) such
Owner shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of the occurrence of an Event of
Default hereunder; (b) the Owners of at least twenty-five percent (25%) in aggregate principal
amount of all the Certificates then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the
Trustee to exercise the powers hereinbefore granted or to institute such action, suit or
proceeding in its own name; (c) said Owners shall have tendered to the Trustee reasonable
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such
request; and (d) the Trustee shall have refused or omitted to comply with such request for a
period of sixty (60) days after such written request shall have been received by, and said tender
of indemnity shall have been made to, the Trustee.

       Such notification, request, tender of indemnity and refusal or omission are hereby
declared, in every case, to be conditions precedent to the exercise by any Owner of Certificates


                                                -39-
of any remedy hereunder; it being understood and intended that no one or more Owners of
Certificates shall have any right in any manner whatever by his or their action to enforce any
right under this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided, and that all proceedings at
law or in equity with respect to an Event of Default shall be instituted, had and maintained in
the manner herein provided and for the equal benefit of all Owners of the Outstanding
Certificates.

       The right of any Owner of any Certificate to receive payment of said Owner's
proportionate interest in the Lease Payments as the same become due, or to institute suit for the
enforcement of such payment, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such
Owner, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section or any other provision of this
Agreement.

        Section 13.01. Discharge of Trust Agreement. The Certificates may be paid by the City
in any of the following ways, provided that the City also pays or causes to be paid any other
sums payable hereunder by the City:

               (a) by paying or causing to be paid the Principal Amount relating to the
       Certificates, together with interest thereon, as and when the same become due and
       payable ;

               (b) by depositing with the Trustee, in trust, at or before maturity, money or
       securities in the necessary amount (as provided in Section 13.03) to pay or prepay all
       Certificates then Outstanding; or

              (c) by delivering to the Trustee, for cancellation by it, all of the Certificates then
       Outstanding.

        If the City shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable by the City
hereunder, then and in that case, at the election of the City (evidenced by a Written Request of
the City, filed with the Trustee, signifying the intention of the City to discharge all such
indebtedness and this Trust Agreement), and notwithstanding that any Certificates shall not
have been surrendered for payment, this Trust Agreement and the pledge of Lease Payments
and other assets made under this Trust Agreement and all covenants, agreements and other
obligations of the City under this Trust Agreement shall cease, terminate, become void and be
completely discharged and satisfied. In such event, upon the Written Request of the City, the
Trustee shall cause an accounting for such period or periods as may be requested by the City to
be prepared and filed with the City and shall execute and deliver to the City all such
instruments as may be necessary or desirable to evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and
the Trustee shall pay over, transfer, assign or deliver all moneys or securities or other property
held by it pursuant to this Trust Agreement which are not required for the payment or
prepayment of Certificates not theretofore surrendered for such payment or prepayment to the
City.

         Section 13.02. Discharge of Liability on Certificates. Upon the deposit with the
Trustee, in trust, at or before maturity, of money or securities in the necessary amount (as
provided in Section 13.03) to pay or prepay any Outstanding Certificates (whether upon or
prior to their respective maturities or the prepayment date of such Certificates), provided that, if
such Certificates are to be prepaid prior to maturity, notice of such prepayment shall have been
given as provided in Article IV or provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for
the giving of such notice, then all liability of the City in respect of such Certificates shall cease,
terminate and be completely discharged, and the Owner thereof shall thereafter be entitled only
to payment out of such money or securities deposited with the Trustee as aforesaid for their
payment, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 13.04.




                                                 -41-
       The City may at any time surrender to the Trustee for cancellation by it any Certificates
previously executed and delivered, which the City may have acquired in any manner
whatsoever, and such Certificates, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be
paid and retired.

        Section 13.03. Deposit of Money or Securities with Trustee. Whenever in this Trust
Agreement it is provided or permitted that there be deposited with or held in trust by the
Trustee money or securities in the necessary amount to pay or redeem any Certificates, the
money or securities so to be deposited or held may include money or securities held by the
Trustee in the funds established pursuant to this Trust Agreement and shall be--

               (a) lawful money of the United States of America in an amount equal to the
       principal amount of such Certificates and all unpaid interest thereon to maturity, except
       that, in the case of Certificates which are to be prepaid prior to maturity and in respect
       of which notice of such prepayment shall have been given as provided in Article IV or
       provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for the giving of such notice,
       the amount to be deposited or held shall be the principal amount of such Certificates
       and all unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date; or

               (b) Defeasance Obligations (as defined below), the principal of and interest on
       which when due will provide money sufficient to pay the principal of and all unpaid
       interest to maturity, or to the prepayment date, as the case may be, on the Certificates to
       be paid or prepaid, as such principal and interest become due, provided that, in the case
       of Certificates which are to be prepaid prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such
       prepayment shall have been given as provided in Article IV or provision satisfactory to
       the Trustee shall have been made for the giving of such notice;

       provided, in each case, that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed (by the
terms of this Trust Agreement or by Written Request of the City) to apply such money to the
payment of such principal and interest with respect to such Certificates.

        For purposes of this Section, "Defeasance Obligations" shall mean the United States
Obligations and Pre-refunded Municipal Obligations defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of the
definition of Investment Securities.

         Section 13.04. Payment of Certificates After Discharge of Trust Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Trust Agreement, any moneys held by the Trustee in
trust for the payment of the Principal Amount relating to any Certificates, together with interest
thereon and remaining unclaimed for two years after the Principal Amount relating to all of the
Certificates has become due and payable (whether at maturity or upon call for prepayment as
provided in this Trust Agreement), if such moneys were so held at such date, or two years after
the date of deposit of such moneys if deposited after said date when all of the Certificates
became due and payable, shall be repaid to the City free from the trusts created by this Trust
Agreement upon receipt of an indemnification agreement acceptable to the City and the Trustee
indemnifying the City and the Trustee with respect to claims of Owners of Certificates which
have not yet been paid, and all liability of the Trustee with respect to such moneys shall
thereupon cease; provided, however, that before the repayment of such moneys to the City as


                                               -42-
aforesaid, the Trustee may (at the cost of the City) first mail to the Owners of Certificates which
have not yet been paid, at the addresses shown on the Registration Books a notice, in such form
as may be deemed appropriate by the Trustee with respect to the Certificates so payable and not
presented and with respect to the provisions relating to the repayment to the City of the moneys
held for the payment thereof.

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT:


        THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT the Registered Owner identified above, or registered
assigns, as the registered owner (the "Registered Owner") of this Certificate of Participation (the
"Certificate") is the owner of an undivided fractional interest in Lease Payments under the Lease
Agreement dated as of [          ] 1, 2018, by and between the Palo Alto Public Improvement
Corporation, a nonprofit public benefit corporation duly formed and acting under the laws of
the State of California (the "Corporation"), and the City of Palo Alto, a chartered municipal
corporation and political subdivision duly organized and existing under the Constitution and
the laws of the State of California the ("City") (the " Lease Agreement") which Lease Payments
and certain other rights and interests under the Lease Agreement have been assigned to U.S.
Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), having a corporate trust office in San
Francisco, California or such other place as designated by the Trustee (the "Corporate Trust
Office") or such other or additional offices as the Trustee may designate from time to time as the
corporate trust office.




                                               A-1
        The Registered Owner of this Certificate is entitled to receive, subject to the terms of the
Lease Agreement, on the Maturity Date identified above, the Principal Amount identified
above, representing a portion of the Lease Payments designated as principal, and to receive on
[May 1, 2018] and semiannually thereafter on May 1 and November 1 of each year (the
"Payment Dates") until payment in full of said principal, the Registered Owner's proportionate
share of the Lease Payments designated as interest coming due during the interest period
immediately preceding each of the Payment Dates; provided that interest with respect hereto
shall be payable from the Payment Date next preceding the date of execution of this Certificate
unless (i) this Certificate is executed on a Payment Date, in which event interest shall be payable
from such Payment Date, or (ii) this Certificate is executed after the close of business on the
fifteenth (15th) day of the month immediately preceding a Payment Date and prior to such
Payment Date, in which event interest shall be payable from such Payment Date, or (iii) unless
this Certificate is executed on or before the Record Date immediately preceding the first
Payment Date, in which event interest shall be payable from the Closing Date. Said
proportionate share of the portion of the Lease Payments designated as interest is the result of
the multiplication of the aforesaid portion of the Lease Payments designated as principal by the
Rate of Interest per annum identified above. Said amounts are payable in lawful money of the
United States of America in the case of principal and interest at maturity upon presentation
hereof at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and in the case of interest prior to maturity
by check or draft mailed by the Trustee to the Registered Owner hereof at the address as it
appears on the registration books of the Trustee.

        This Certificate has been executed and delivered by the Trustee pursuant to the terms of
a Trust Agreement by and among the Trustee, the Corporation and the City, dated as of [ ] 1,
2018 (the "Trust Agreement"). The City has certified that it is authorized to enter into the Lease
Agreement and the Trust Agreement under the constitution and laws of the State of California,
for the purpose of leasing certain land and public improvements from the Corporation.
Reference is hereby made to the Lease Agreement and the Trust Agreement (copies of which are
on file at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee) for a description of the terms on which the
Certificates are delivered, the rights thereunder of the owners of the Certificates, the rights,
duties and immunities of the Trustee and the rights and obligations of the City under the Lease
Agreement, to all of the provisions of the Lease Agreement and the Trust Agreement the
Registered Owner of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, assents and agrees.

        The City is obligated under the Lease Agreement to pay Lease Payments from any
source of available funds. The obligation of the City to pay the Lease Payments does not
constitute an obligation of the City for which the City is obligated to levy or pledge any form of
taxation or for which the City has levied or pledged any form of taxation. The obligation of the
City to pay Lease Payments does not constitute a debt of the City, the State of California or any
of its political subdivisions, and does not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any
constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction.

        To the extent and in the manner permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, the
provisions of the Trust Agreement may be amended by the parties thereto with the written
consent of the owners of at least sixty percent (60%) in aggregate principal amount of the
Certificates then outstanding, and may be amended without such consent under certain
circumstances; provided that no such amendment shall adversely affect the interests of the


                                                A-2
owners of the Certificates or shall impair the right of any owner to receive in any case such
owner's proportionate share of any Lease Payment in accordance with such owner's Certificate.

        This Certificate is transferable by the Registered Owner hereof, in person or by his
attorney duly authorized in writing, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, but only in the
manner, subject to the limitations and upon payment of the charges, if any, provided in the
Trust Agreement and upon surrender and cancellation of this Certificate. Upon such transfer a
new Certificate or Certificates, of authorized denomination or denominations and of the same
maturity, for the same aggregate principal amount will be executed and delivered to the
transferee in exchange herefor. The City, the Corporation and the Trustee may treat the
registered owner hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this
Certificate shall be overdue, and the City, the Corporation and the Trustee shall not be affected
by any notice to the contrary.

        The Certificates maturing on or before May 1, 20[ ], are not subject to optional
prepayment prior to their respective stated maturities. The Certificates maturing on or after
May 1, 20[ ] are subject to optional prepayment prior to their respective stated maturities, at the
option of the City, in whole, or in part among maturities on such basis as designated by the City
and by lot within any one maturity, on any date on or after May 1, 20[ ], from prepayments of
the Lease Payments made pursuant to the Lease Agreement, at the prepayment price (expressed
as percentages of the principal amount of Certificates or portions thereof to be prepaid) set forth
in the following table, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for prepayment:

                                                                      Prepayment

       Mandatory Sinking Fund Prepayments of the Certificates. The Certificates maturing
on May 1 in each of the years [20[ ], 20[ ] and 20[ ]] are subject to mandatory sinking fund
prepayment prior to their respective stated maturities, in the amounts and years set forth below,

       The Certificates are also subject to prepayment on any date in whole, or in part among

        As provided in the Trust Agreement, notice of prepayment shall be mailed, not less than
thirty (30) nor more than forty-five (45) days before the prepayment date, to the registered
owner of the Certificate to be prepaid, but neither failure to receive such notice nor any defect in
the notice so mailed shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for prepayment.

        If this Certificate is called for prepayment and payment is duly provided therefor as
specified in the Trust Agreement, interest represented hereby shall cease to accrue from and
after the date fixed for prepayment.

        Unless this Certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository

representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE
OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner
hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.

                                        PURCHASE AGREEMENT

                                               _____, 2018


City of Palo Alto
250 Hamilton Ave.
 Palo Alto, CA 94301

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        [Underwriter] (the “Underwriter”) offers to enter into this Purchase Agreement
(this “Purchase Agreement”) with the City of Palo Alto (the “City”). This offer is made
subject to the City’s acceptance by execution of this Purchase Agreement and delivery
of the same to the Underwriter on or before 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the date hereof,
and, if not so accepted, will be subject to withdrawal by the Underwriter upon notice
delivered to the City at any time prior to such acceptance. Upon the acceptance hereof,
the Purchase Agreement will be binding upon the City and the Underwriter.

        The City acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the primary role of the Underwriter,
as an underwriter, is to purchase securities, for resale to investors, in an arm’s length
commercial transaction between the City and the Underwriter, and the Underwriter has
financial and other interests that differ from those of the City; (ii) the Underwriter is acting
solely as a principal and is not acting as a Municipal Advisor (as defined in Section 15B
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), municipal
advisor or fiduciary to the City, and has not assumed any advisory or fiduciary
responsibility to the City with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby and the
discussions, undertakings and procedures leading thereto (irrespective of whether the
Underwriter has provided other services or is currently providing other services to the
City on other matters); (iii) the only obligations the Underwriter has to the City with
respect to the transaction contemplated hereby expressly are set forth in this Purchase
Agreement; and (iv) the City has consulted its own municipal, legal, accounting, tax,
financial and other advisors, as applicable, to the extent they have deemed appropriate.
The City acknowledges and represents that it has engaged PFM Financial Advisors LLC.
as its municipal advisor (the “Municipal Advisor”) and will rely solely on the financial
advice of the Municipal Advisor with respect to the Certificates.

       Capitalized terms used in this Purchase Agreement and not otherwise defined
herein will have the respective meanings set forth for such terms in the Trust Agreement
(defined below).

       Section 1. Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and conditions and upon the
basis of the representations set forth in this Purchase Agreement, the Underwriter
agrees to purchase for offering to the public, and the City agrees to cause the execution
and delivery to the Underwriter, all (but not less than all) of the certificates of
participation captioned above (the “Certificates”) at a purchase price of
$_______________ (being an amount equal to the principal amount of the Certificates
($_________.00), plus a net original issue premium/less a net original issue discount of
$__________, and less an underwriter’s discount of $___________). The obligations of
the Underwriter to purchase, accept delivery of and pay for the Certificates will be
conditioned on the delivery of all of the Certificates to the Underwriter at Closing
(hereafter defined).

        Section 2. Certificate Terms; Authorizing Instruments; Purpose. The
Certificates will be dated their date of delivery and will mature and bear interest as
shown on Exhibit A. The Certificates will be as described in, and will be executed and
delivered under, a Trust Agreement, dated as of ______ 1, 2018 (“Trust Agreement”),
among the Palo Alto Public Improvement Corporation (the “Corporation”), the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Certificates are payable
and subject to prepayment as shown in Exhibit A.

        The Certificates represent undivided proportionate interests in    “Lease
Payments” to be made by the City under a Lease Agreement, dated as of _____ 1,
2018 (the “Lease Agreement”), between the City, as lessee, and the Corporation, as
lessor.

       The City and the Corporation are also entering into a Property Lease, dated as of
_____ 1, 2018 (the “Property Lease”), under which the City leases the real property
described therein to the Corporation and, under the Lease Agreement, the Corporation
leases the same real property back to the City.

      The Corporation will assign to the Trustee its right to receive the Lease
Payments pursuant to an Assignment Agreement, dated as of _____ 1, 2018 (the
“Assignment Agreement”).

         The proceeds of the sale of the Certificates will be used to (i) provide funds to
refinance a lease payment obligation of the City related to the City’s outstanding City of
Palo Alto Certificates of Participation Series 2002B (Taxable) (Civic Center Refinancing
and Downtown Parking Improvements Project)(the “2002 Certificates”) and to defease
the 2002 Certificates, (ii) finance the cost of improving the City’s municipal golf course,
and (iii) pay the costs of executing and delivering the Certificates.

        Section 3. Public Offering. The Underwriter agrees to make an initial bona fide
public offering of all of the Certificates, at not in excess of the initial public offering yields
or prices set forth on Exhibit A. Following the initial public offering of the Certificates, the
offering prices may be changed from time to time by the Underwriter, provided that the
Underwriter shall not change any of the principal amounts or the interest rates set forth
on Exhibit A. The Certificates may be offered and sold to certain dealers at prices lower
than such initial public offering prices.

        The Certificates are subject to prepayment as set forth in Exhibit A.

       Section 4. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. The City has delivered
to the Underwriter the Preliminary Official Statement dated _____, 2018 (the
“Preliminary Official Statement”) and will deliver to the Underwriter a final official


                                                2
statement dated the date of this Purchase Agreement (as amended and supplemented
from time to time pursuant to Section 5(j) of this Purchase Agreement, the “Official
Statement”). Subsequent to its receipt of the City’s 15c2-12 Certificate, in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, deeming the Preliminary Official Statement final
for purposes of Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Rule 15c2-
12”), the Underwriter has distributed copies of the Preliminary Official Statement. The
City hereby ratifies the use by the Underwriter of the Preliminary Official Statement and
authorizes the Underwriter to use and distribute in printed and/or electronic format the
Official Statement (including all information previously permitted to have been omitted by
Rule 15c2-12, and any supplements and amendments thereto as have been approved
by the City as evidenced by the execution and delivery of such document by an officer of
the Corporation and the City), the Trust Agreement, the Property Lease, the Assignment
Agreement, the Lease Agreement, this Purchase Agreement, the Continuing Disclosure
Certificate (hereinafter defined) and all information contained therein, and all other
documents, certificates and written statements furnished by the City to the Underwriter in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Purchase Agreement, in
connection with the offer and sale of the Certificates by the Underwriter.

        The Underwriter hereby agrees to deliver a copy of the Official Statement to the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”) through the Electronic Municipal
Marketplace Access website of the MSRB on or before the Closing Date and otherwise
to comply with all applicable statutes and regulations in connection with the offering and
sale of the Certificates, including, without limitation, MSRB Rule G-32 and Rule 15c2-12.
The City agrees to deliver to the Underwriter as many copies of the Official Statement as
the Underwriter will reasonably request as necessary to comply with paragraph (b)(4) of
Rule 15c2-12. The City agrees to deliver the final Official Statement within seven
business days after the execution hereof, or such earlier date identified by the
Underwriter to be necessary to allow the Underwriter to meet its obligations under Rule
15c2-12 and Rule G-32 of the MSRB.

        The Underwriter agrees to: (1) provide the City with final pricing information with
respect to the Certificates on a timely basis prior to the Closing and (2) take any and all
other actions necessary to comply with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and MSRB rules governing the offering, sale and delivery of the Certificates to
ultimate purchasers.

         In connection with execution and delivery of the Certificates, and in order to
assist the Underwriter with complying with the provisions of Rule 15c2-12, the City will
execute a continuing disclosure certificate (the “Continuing Disclosure Certificate”),
under which the City will undertake to provide certain financial and operating data as
required by Rule 15c2-12. The form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate is attached
as an appendix to the Preliminary Official Statement and will be attached as an appendix
to the final Official Statement.

       Section 5. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the City. The
City hereby represents, warrants and agrees with the Underwriter that:

       (a) The City is a municipal corporation and charter city, organized and existing
under the Constitution of the State of California (the “State”) and has all necessary
power and authority to adopt its resolution adopted on April 16, 2018 (the “City
Resolution”), to enter into and perform its duties under the Property Lease, the Lease


                                            3
Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Continuing Disclosure Certificate, and this
Purchase Agreement (the “City Agreements”).

        (b) The city council (the “City Council”) of the City has taken official action by
adopting the City Resolution by a majority of the members of the City Council at a
meeting duly called, noticed and conducted, at which a quorum was present and acting
throughout, authorizing the execution and, delivery of the Trust Agreement, the the
Lease Agreement, the Property Lease and the Continuing Disclosure Certificate and due
performance of the City Agreements and the Official Statement and the taking of any

Statement and the preparation, execution and delivery of the Official Statement, has duly
authorized and approved the execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations under, the City Agreements, and the consummation by it of all other
transactions contemplated by the City Resolution, the City Agreements, the Preliminary
Official Statement and the Official Statement. When executed and delivered by their
respective parties, the City Agreements (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by and enforceability against the other parties thereto) will be in full force and
effect and each will constitute legal, valid and binding agreements or obligations of the
City, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforcement
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
laws or equitable principles relating to or limiting creditors rights generally, the
application of equitable principles, the exercise of judicial discretion and the limitations
on legal remedies against public entities in the State.

         (d) At the time of the City’s acceptance hereof and at all times subsequent
thereto up to and including the time of the Closing, the information and statements in the
Official Statement (other than any information concerning the Depository Trust Company
and the book-entry system for the Certificates or provided by the Underwriter) do not and
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

        (e) As of the date hereof other than as disclosed in the Official Statement,
there is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation before or by any court, public board
or body pending against the City or, to the best knowledge of the City, threatened,
wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would: (i) affect the creation,
organization, existence or powers of the City, or the titles of its members or officers; (ii)
in any way question or affect the validity or enforceability of City Agreements or the
Certificates, or (iii) in any way question or affect this Purchase Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Purchase Agreement, the Official Statement, or any
other agreement or instrument to which the City is a party relating to the Certificates.

        (f)   There is no consent, approval, authorization or other order of, or filing or
registration with, or certification by, any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the
City required for the execution and delivery of this Purchase Agreement or the
consummation by the City of the other transactions contemplated by the Official
Statement or the City Agreements.


                                             4
      (g) Any certificate signed by any official of the City authorized to do so will be
deemed a representation and warranty by the City to the Underwriter as to the
statements made therein.

        (h) Except as previously disclosed to the Underwriter, the City is not in default,
and at no time has the City defaulted in any material respect, on any bond, note or other
obligation for borrowed money or any agreement under which any such obligation is or
was outstanding.

        (i)  Except as disclosed in the Official Statement or otherwise disclosed in
writing to the Underwriter, there has not been any materially adverse change in the
financial condition of the City since June 30, 2017, and there has been no occurrence or
circumstance or combination thereof that is reasonably expected to result in any such
materially adverse change.

       (j)   If between the date of this Purchase Agreement and the date which is 25
days following the End of the Underwriting Period (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of Rule
15c2-12), any event will occur which might cause the Official Statement, as then
supplemented or amended, to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the City will immediately notify the Underwriter, and if, in the opinion of the
Underwriter and the City, such event requires the preparation and publication of a
supplement or amendment to the Official Statement, the City will at its expense
supplement or amend the Official Statement in a form and in a manner approved by the
Underwriter.

       (k) After the Closing, the City will not participate in the issuance of any
amendment of or supplement to the Official Statement to which, after being furnished
with a copy, the Underwriter reasonably objects in writing or which is disapproved by
Underwriter’s Counsel.

        (l)  The instances in which the City has previously failed to comply in all
material respects with any undertakings under Rule 15c2-12 in the past five years are
described in the Official Statement. The report of ______ dated _____, 2018 (the
“Continuing Disclosure Due Diligence Report”) identifies all of the issues for which
the City and other related entities were obligated to provide continuing disclosure under
Rule 15c2-12 during the past five years and all of the material event filings that were
required with respect to such issues during the five-year period.

      (m) The City does not need the consent of its auditor to include its
comprehensive annual financial report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as an
appendix to the Official Statement.

        (n) The City will comply with the defeasance and prepayment provisions of the
legal documents related to the 2002 Certificates and the related lease agreement.

        (o) The City covenants with the Underwriter that the City will cooperate with the
Underwriter (at the cost and written directions of the Underwriter), in qualifying the
Certificates for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdiction of


                                             5
the United States as the Underwriter may reasonably request; provided, however, that
the City shall not be required to consent to suit or to service of process, or to qualify to
do business, in any jurisdiction. The City consents to the use by the Underwriter of the
City Agreements, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement in the
course of its compliance with the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various jurisdictions
related to the offering and sale of the Certificates.

       Section 6. The Closing. At 8:00 A.M., Pacific time, on ______, 2018, or on
such earlier or later time or date as may be agreed upon by the Underwriter and the City
(the “Closing”), the Corporation will deliver the Certificates to the Underwriter, through
the book-entry system of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). Prior to the Closing,
the City will deliver, at the offices of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation
(“Special Counsel”) in San Francisco, California, or such other place as is mutually
agreed upon by the Underwriter and the City, the other documents described in this
Purchase Agreement. On the date of the Closing, the Underwriter will pay the purchase
price of the Certificates as set forth in Section 1 of this Purchase Agreement in
immediately available funds to the order of the Trustee.

        The Certificates will be executed and delivered in fully registered form and will be
prepared and delivered as one Certificate for each maturity registered in the name of a
nominee of DTC. It is anticipated that CUSIP identification numbers will be inserted on
the Certificates, but neither the failure to provide such numbers nor any error with
respect thereto will constitute a cause for failure or refusal by the Underwriter to accept
delivery of the Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Purchase Agreement.

        Section 7. Conditions to Underwriter’s Obligations. The Underwriter has
entered into this Purchase Agreement in reliance upon the representations and
warranties of the City contained herein and to be contained in the documents and

             required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

          For purposes of compliance with Rule 15c2-12 of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, as amended
(“Rule 15c2-12”), this Preliminary Official Statement constitutes an “official statement” of the City with respect to the Certificates
that has been deemed “final” by the City as of its date except for the omission of no more than the information permitted by Rule 15c2-
12.

          No dealer, broker, salesperson or other person has been authorized to give any information or to make any
representation other than those contained herein and, if given or made, such other information or representation must not
be relied upon as having been authorized. This Official Statement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the Certificates by a person in any jurisdiction in which it is unlawful for such person
to make an offer, solicitation or sale.

         This Official Statement is not to be construed as a contract with the purchasers of the Certificates. Statements
contained in this Official Statement which involve estimates, forecasts or matters of opinion, whether or not expressly so
described herein, are intended solely as such and are not to be construed as representations of facts.

          The information set forth herein has been obtained from the City and from other sources and is believed to be
reliable but is not guaranteed as to accuracy or completeness. The information and expressions of opinions herein are subject
to change without notice and neither the delivery of this Official Statement nor any sale made hereunder shall, under any
circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the City since the date hereof. This
Official Statement is submitted in connection with the sale of the Certificates referred to herein and may not be reproduced
or used, in whole or in part, for any other purpose, unless authorized in writing by the City. All summaries of the Certificates,
the Lease Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Assignment Agreement, the Property Lease, or other documents, are made
subject to the provisions of such documents and do not purport to be complete statements of any or all of such provisions.
Reference is hereby made to such documents on file with the Director Finance for further information. See
“INTRODUCTION—Other Information.”

       IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING, THE UNDERWRITER MAY OVER-ALLOT OR EFFECT
TRANSACTIONS WHICH STABILIZE OR MAINTAIN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE CERTIFICATES AT A
LEVEL ABOVE THAT WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL IN THE OPEN MARKET. SUCH STABILIZING,
IF COMMENCED, MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. THE UNDERWRITER MAY OFFER AND SELL
THE CERTIFICATES TO CERTAIN DEALERS, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND OTHERS AT PRICES
LOWER THAN THE PUBLIC OFFERING PRICES STATED ON THE COVER PAGE HEREOF AND SUCH PUBLIC
OFFERING PRICES MAY BE CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE UNDERWRITER.

         Certain statements included or incorporated by reference in this Official Statement constitute “forward-looking
statements.” Such statements are generally identifiable by the terminology used such as “plan,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“budget” or other similar words. The achievement of certain results or other expectations contained in such forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance
or achievements described to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements. No assurance is given that actual results will meet the City’s forecasts in any
way. Neither the City nor the Corporation is obligated to issue any updates or revisions to the forward-looking statements if
or when its expectations, or events, conditions or circumstances on which such statements are based occur or do not occur.

         The execution, sale and delivery of the Certificates has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, in reliance upon exemptions provided thereunder by Sections 3(a)(2)
and 3(a)(12), respectively, for the issuance and sale of municipal securities.

Source of Payment for the Certificates

         The Certificates represent direct, undivided interests of the Owners thereof in the Lease Payments

Leased Property. The Lease Payments are subject to abatement during any period in which by reason of
damage or destruction there is substantial interference with the use and occupancy by the City of the Leased
Property or any portion thereof. The City will covenant under the Lease Agreement to take such action as
necessary to include the Lease Payments in its annual budget and to make all necessary appropriations
therefor (subject to abatement under certain circumstances described in the Lease Agreement). Pursuant
to an Assignment Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2018 (the “Assignment Agreement”), by and between
the Corporation and the Trustee, the Corporation will assign to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Owners
of the Certificates, certain of its rights under the Lease Agreement, including its right to receive Lease
Payments from the City for the purpose of securing the payment of principal and interest with respect to
the Certificates. See “SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE CERTIFICATES” and “RISK FACTORS.”

        A reserve fund will not be funded for the Certificates.

       THE OBLIGATION OF THE CITY TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER THE LEASE
AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OBLIGATION OF THE CITY FOR WHICH THE
CITY IS OBLIGATED TO LEVY OR PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION OR FOR WHICH THE
CITY HAS LEVIED OR PLEDGED ANY FORM OF TAXATION. NEITHER THE CERTIFICATES
NOR THE OBLIGATION OF THE CITY TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER THE LEASE
AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES AN INDEBTEDNESS OF THE CITY OR THE STATE OR ANY OF
ITS POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR
STATUTORY DEBT LIMITATIONS.

         Golf Course Project. Transformation of the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course into the Baylands Golf
Link has been achieved with a full course redesign by architect Forrest Richardson and construction by
Wadsworth Golf. The project included renovation of all 18 course holes, renovation of practice chipping
and putting greens, addition of a short game practice area, and addition of a youth learning area. The course
has changed from a flat and linear layout to a links style course with some elevation changes providing views
of the adjacent Baylands Preserve and San Francisco Bay. The renovation project included all new irrigation
lines, a new irrigation system, and a pump station. Course construction is complete and the course is being
prepared for a grand opening towards the end of Spring 2018.

       Design and construction of the new course incorporated the following green environmental
elements:




                                                                 -4-
       • Transition from using a mix of potable and recycled water on the old course to using mostly recycled
         water on the new course by selecting paspalum, a salt tolerant grass.
       • Paspalum goes dormant late fall and into early spring in the region, further reducing the need for
         irrigation.
       • Reduction of maintained turf by 40% in comparison to the old course through course design.
       • Most of this turf reduction is attributed to conversion from turf to native vegetation and wetlands.
         In total, there are 55 acres of vegetation and wetlands on a 141 acre golf course.
       • 7.4 acres of the previous golf course will be converted to in-stream marshland terrace habitat and
         used for flood protection by an adjacent levee expansion project.

         Refunding of the 2002 Certificates. A portion of the net proceeds of the Certificates will be deposited
in an escrow fund (the “Escrow Fund”) established under the Trust Agreement. used to refund, on a
current basis, the 2002B Certificates. All such amounts will be held in cash, uninvested, and will be applied
to the prepayment of the 2002B Certificates on __________, 2018, at a prepayment price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the 2002B Certificates, plus accrued interest to the date of prepayment.

         The 2002B Certificates to be refunded are shown in the following table:

Green Bonds

         The Certificates are being delivered as ''Green Bonds" due to the intended use of the proceeds.
The designation of the Certificates as Green Bonds is intended to allow investors the opportunity to invest
directly in obligations that finance environmentally beneficial projects. The term ''Green Bonds" is not
defined in the Trust Agreement, and its use in this Official Statement is for identification purposes only and
is not intended to provide or imply that the holders of the Certificates are entitled to any additional terms
or security in addition to those provided in the Trust Agreement.

        Use of the proceeds of the Certificates will be tracked by the City. The City will post updates
regarding the use of proceeds of the Certificates with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's
Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system, currently located at www.emma.msrb.org (which
website is not incorporated into this Official Statement by reference), annually, and will post a final list of
projects funded once all proceeds of the Certificates have been spent.

be provided or filed.

                                            THE PROPERTY

       Pursuant to the Property Lease, the City will lease the Leased Property to the Corporation.
Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, the Corporation will, in turn, lease the Leased Property back to the City.
See APPENDIX E—SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS—Property Lease and
APPENDIX E—SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS—Lease Agreement.

        The Leased Property consists of the Palo Alto University Fire Station 1 (301 Alma Street, Palo
Alto, CA 94301), a two story, 10,295 square foot masonry construction with wood roof building constructed
in 1968. The facility was renovated in 1993 which included the addition of female dorms. In 2004, another
renovation occurred that included seismic upgrade. The seismic upgrade brought the station into
conformance with the intent of the essential facilities requirements of the Uniform Building Code. This
allowed the station to remain operational immediately following an earthquake, even though it may suffer
some damage. The critical parts of the seismic upgrade included reinforcement of the apparatus bay door
openings to facilitate the operation of the doors so that equipment can be deployed at the post-event stage.
Work included accessibility upgrades, and kitchen and bathroom renovations

    For a description of certain terms of the Lease Agreement see “SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR
THE CERTIFICATES” and APPENDIX E—SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL
DOCUMENTS—LEASE AGREEMENT.

        Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, the City may substitute the Leased Property, in whole or in part,
by other properties, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. For more information regarding the
substitution of property see “SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE CERTIFICATES—Substitution or
Release of Site or Facility” and APPENDIX E—SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL
DOCUMENTS—Lease Agreement.

        The City has not granted any security interest in the Leased Property for the benefit of the
Certificates and there is no remedy of foreclosure on the Leased Property upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default under the Lease Agreement. For a discussion of remedies upon an Event of Default under the
Lease Agreement, see “RISK FACTORS—Limitations on Remedies.”

        †Maturity.

         Extraordinary Prepayment from Net Proceeds of Insurance and Condemnation. The Certificates are also
subject to prepayment on any date, in whole or in part, from the net proceeds of insurance or condemnation
with respect to the Leased Property, which Net Proceeds are deposited in the accounts within the Lease
Payment Fund on a pro rata basis and credited towards the prepayment of the Lease Payments made by the
City pursuant to the Lease Agreement, at a prepayment price equal to the principal amount of the
Certificates to be prepaid, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for prepayment, without
premium.

         Selection of Certificates for Prepayment. Whenever provision is made for the prepayment of
Certificates and less than all Outstanding Certificates are called for prepayment, the Trustee shall select
Certificates for prepayment from the Outstanding Certificates not previously called for prepayment, among
maturities on a pro rata basis in integral multiples of $5,000 and by lot within a maturity in any manner
deemed appropriate by the Trustee. For the purposes of such selection, Certificates shall be deemed to be
composed of $5,000 portions, and any such portion may be separately prepaid. The Trustee shall promptly
notify the City and the Corporation in writing of the Certificates so selected for prepayment.

         Notice of Prepayment. When prepayment is authorized or required pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
the Trustee shall give notice of the prepayment of the Certificates. Such notice shall specify: (a) that the
Certificates or a designated portion thereof are to be prepaid, (b) the date of prepayment, (c) the place or
places where the prepayment will be made, and (d) that the City has the right to rescind the notice as
provided below. Such notice shall further state that on the specified date there shall become due and payable
upon each Certificate, the principal together with interest accrued to said date, and that from and after such
date interest represented thereby shall cease to accrue and be payable.

         Notice of such prepayment shall be mailed by first class mail to the respective Owners of
Certificates designated for prepayment at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books, at least thirty
(30) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the prepayment date, which notice shall, in addition
to setting forth the above information, set forth, in the case of each Certificate called only in part, the portion
of the principal thereof which is to be prepaid; provided that neither failure to receive such notice so mailed
nor any defect in any notice so mailed shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the prepayment of
such Certificates.

         The City has the right to rescind any notice of the optional prepayment of Certificates by written
notice to the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for prepayment. Any notice of optional prepayment shall
be cancelled and annulled if for any reason funds will not be or are not available on the date fixed for
prepayment for the payment in full of the Certificates then called for prepayment, and such cancellation
shall not constitute an Event of Default. The City and the Trustee have no liability to the Owners or any
other party related to or arising from such rescission of prepayment. The Trustee shall mail notice of such
rescission of prepayment to the respective Owners of the Certificates designated for prepayment at their




                                                        -9-
respective addresses appearing on the Registration Books, and to DTC and the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board.

         Partial Prepayment of Certificate. Upon surrender of any Certificate prepaid in part only, the Trustee
shall execute and deliver to the Owner thereof, at the expense of the City, a new Certificate or Certificates
of authorized denominations equal in aggregate principal amount to the unprepaid portion of the Certificate
surrendered and of the same interest rate and the same maturity.

        Effect of Notice of Prepayment. Notice having been given as aforesaid, and moneys for the prepayment
(including the interest to the applicable date of prepayment and including any applicable premium), having
been set aside in the Lease Payment Fund, the Certificates shall become due and payable on said date of
prepayment, and, upon presentation and surrender thereof at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee,
said Certificates shall be paid at the unpaid principal amount (or applicable portion thereof) with respect
thereto, plus interest accrued and unpaid to said date of prepayment.

         If, on said date of prepayment, moneys for the prepayment of all the Certificates to be prepaid,
together with interest to said date of prepayment, shall be held by the Trustee so as to be available therefor
on such date of prepayment, and, if notice of prepayment thereof shall have been given as aforesaid, then,
from and after said date of prepayment, interest represented by said Certificates shall cease to accrue and
become payable. All moneys held by or on behalf of the Trustee for the prepayment of Certificates shall be
held in trust for the account of the Owners of the Certificates so to be prepaid.

Transfer and Exchange of Certificates

        The registration of any Certificate may, in accordance with its terms, be transferred upon the
Registration Books by the person in whose name it is registered, in person or by his duly authorized attorney,
upon surrender of such Certificate for cancellation at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee,
accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form acceptable to the Trustee, duly
executed. Whenever any Certificate or Certificates shall be surrendered for registration of transfer, the
Trustee shall execute and deliver a new Certificate or Certificates of the same maturity and aggregate
principal amount of the same series, in any authorized denominations.

         Certificates may be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, for a like aggregate
principal amount of Certificates of other authorized denominations of the same maturity and the same
series. The City shall pay any costs of the Trustee incurred in connection with such exchange, except that
the Trustee may require the payment by the Certificate Owner requesting such exchange of any tax or other
governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange.

Book-Entry System

          The Certificates will be initially executed, delivered and registered as one fully registered certificate
for each maturity, without coupons, in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. DTC will act as
securities depository of the Certificates. Individual purchases may be made in book-entry form only, in the
principal amount of $5,000 and integral multiples thereof. Purchasers will not receive physical certificates
representing their interest in the Certificates purchased. Principal and interest will be paid to DTC which
will in turn remit such principal and interest to its participants for subsequent disbursement to the beneficial
owners of the Certificates as described herein. So long as DTC’s book-entry system is in effect with respect
to the Certificates, notices to Owners of the Certificates by the City or the Trustee will be sent to DTC.



                                                       -10-
Notices and communication by DTC to its participants, and then to the beneficial owners of the Certificates,
will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to then effective statutory or regulatory
requirements. See APPENDIX F—DTC’S BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.

        In the event that such book-entry system is discontinued with respect to the Certificates, the City
will cause the Trustee to execute and deliver replacements in the form of registered certificates and,
thereafter, the Certificates will be transferable and exchangeable on the terms and conditions provided in
the Trust Agreement. In addition, the following provisions would then apply: Payment of interest due with
respect to any Certificate on any Interest Payment Date will be made to the person appearing on the
Registration Books as the Owner thereof as of the Regular Record Date immediately preceding such Interest
Payment Date, such interest to be paid by check mailed on the Interest Payment Date by first class mail to
such Owner at his or her address as it appears on the Registration Books as of such Regular Record Date or,
upon written request filed with the Trustee prior to the Regular Record Date by an Owner of at least
$1,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Certificates, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
an account in the United States designated by such Owner in such written request. Any such written request
will remain in effect until rescinded in writing by the Owner. The principal and prepayment price with
respect to the Certificates at maturity or upon prior prepayment shall be payable by check denominated in
lawful money of the United States of America upon surrender of the Certificates at the Principal Corporate
Trust Office.


                         SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE CERTIFICATES

General

        Each Certificate represents a direct, undivided interest in the Lease Payments. Pursuant to the
Lease Agreement, the City will lease the Leased Property from the Corporation and agree to make Lease
Payments. See “THE PROPERTY.” Upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Lease
Agreement, the City may substitute the Leased Property with other properties. See “Substitution or
Release of Site or Facility” below.

        As security for the Certificates, the Corporation will assign to the Trustee for the payment of
principal and interest with respect to the Certificates, the Corporation’s rights, title and interest in the Lease
Agreement (with certain exceptions), including the right to receive Lease Payments to be made by the City
under the Lease Agreement. The Lease Payments are designed to be sufficient, in both time and amount,
to pay when due, the principal and interest with respect to the Certificates. The Lease Payments are payable
by the City from any source of legally available funds.

       THE OBLIGATION OF THE CITY TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER THE LEASE
AGREEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OBLIGATION OF THE CITY FOR WHICH THE
CITY IS OBLIGATED TO LEVY OR PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION OR FOR WHICH THE
CITY HAS LEVIED OR PLEDGED ANY FORM OF TAXATION. NEITHER THE CERTIFICATES
NOR THE OBLIGATION OF THE CITY TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER THE LEASE
AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES AN INDEBTEDNESS OF THE CITY OR THE STATE OR ANY OF
ITS POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR
STATUTORY DEBT LIMITATIONS.




                                                       -11-
Lease Payments; Covenant to Appropriate

        Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, the City has agreed to make Lease Payments for the lease of the
Leased Property which are calculated to be sufficient to pay principal and interest due with respect to the
Certificates. Lease Payments will be made by the City to the Trustee on March 15 and September 15 in
each year, in advance of the corresponding April 1 and October 1 Interest Payment Dates. The City will
also pay as additional payments (“Additional Payments”), amounts required for the payment of all costs
and expenses incurred by the City to comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the Lease
Agreement or in connection with the execution and delivery of the Certificates. The City has covenanted
under the Lease Agreement to take such action as may be necessary to include all Lease Payments and
Additional Payments in its annual budget and to make the necessary annual appropriations for all such
payments. Under certain circumstances described under the Lease Agreement, however, Lease Payments
are subject to abatement during periods of substantial interference with the City’s use and occupancy of the
Leased Property or any portion thereof. See “SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE CERTIFICATES—
Abatement.”

Insurance

         The City is required to keep or cause to be kept casualty insurance against loss or damage by fire
and lightning, with extended coverage and vandalism and malicious mischief insurance, in an amount at
least equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the replacement cost of the Leased Property. Such insurance
shall, as nearly as practicable, cover loss or damage by explosion, windstorm, riot, aircraft, vehicle damage,
smoke and such other hazards as are normally covered by such insurance. The City is not required by the
Lease Agreement to maintain earthquake coverage with respect to the Leased Property and the City does
not expect to purchase such coverage.

         To insure against loss of rental income caused by perils mentioned above, the City is required to
maintain, or cause to be maintained throughout the term of the Lease Agreement, rental interruption or use
and occupancy insurance to cover loss, total or partial, of the use of any part of the Leased Property as a
result of any of the hazards described above in an amount equal to two times the maximum annual Lease
Payments.

        Public liability and property damage insurance coverage is required in the minimum liability limits
of $1,000,000 for personal injury or death of each person and $3,000,000 for personal injury or deaths of
two or more persons in each accident or event, and in a minimum amount of $100,000 (subject to a
deductible clause of not to exceed $5,000) for damage to property resulting from each accident or event.
Such public liability and property damage insurance may, however, be in the form of a single limit policy in
the amount of $3,000,000 covering all such risks. Such liability insurance may be maintained as part of or
in conjunction with any other liability insurance coverage carried by the City and may be maintained in the
form of insurance maintained through a joint exercise of powers authority created for such purpose or in
the form of self-insurance by the City. The net proceeds of such liability insurance shall be applied toward
extinguishment or satisfaction of the liability with respect to which the insurance proceeds shall have been
paid.

        The City shall provide, from moneys in the Delivery Costs Fund or at its own expense, on the
Closing Date, a CLTA title insurance policy in the amount of not less than the principal amount of the
Certificates, insuring the City’s leasehold estate in the Leased Property, subject only to Permitted
Encumbrances.

     See APPENDIX E—SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS—LEASE
AGREEMENT—Insurance.

Abatement

         Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, the amount of Lease Payments will be abated, during any period
in which by reason of damage or destruction (other than by eminent domain which is otherwise provided
for) there is substantial interference with the use and occupancy by the City of the Leased Property or the
Leased Property or any portion thereof. The amount of such abatement shall be agreed upon by the City
and the Corporation such that the resulting Lease Payments represent fair consideration for the use and
occupancy of the portions of the Leased Property not damaged or destroyed. Such abatement shall continue
for the period commencing with such damage or destruction and ending with the substantial completion of
the work of repair or reconstruction. In the event of any such damage or destruction, the Lease Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect and the City waives any right to terminate the Lease Agreement by
virtue of any such damage and destruction. However, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Lease
Agreement, there shall be no abatement of Lease Payments to the extent that the proceeds of an eminent
domain or insurance award are available to pay Lease Payments, or to the extent that moneys are available
in the Lease Payment Fund, it being declared that such proceeds and amounts constitute special funds for
the payment of the Lease Payments. See “SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE CERTIFICATES—
Insurance,” APPENDIX E—SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS—Lease
Agreement—Insurance and APPENDIX E—SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL
DOCUMENTS—Lease Agreement—Abatement of Lease Payments in the Event of Damage or
Destruction.

Eminent Domain

         Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, if the Leased Property is taken permanently under the power of
eminent domain or sold to a government threatening to exercise the power of eminent domain, the term of
the Lease Agreement shall cease as of the day possession shall be so taken. If less than all of the Leased
Property is taken permanently, or if the Leased Property or any part thereof shall be taken temporarily,
under the power of eminent domain, (1) the Lease Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and
shall not be terminated by virtue of such taking and the parties waive the benefit of any law to the contrary,
and (2) there shall be a partial abatement of Lease Payments as a result of the application of the Net Proceeds
of any eminent domain award to the prepayment of the Lease Payments, in an amount to be agreed upon by
the City and the Corporation such that the resulting Lease Payments represent fair consideration for the
use and occupancy of the remaining usable portion of the Leased Property. The City covenants to contest
any eminent domain award which is insufficient to either: (i) prepay the Certificates in whole, if all of the
Leased Property is condemned; or (ii) prepay a pro rata share of Certificates, in the event that less than all
of the Leased Property is condemned.

No Reserve Fund

        A reserve fund will not be funded for the Certificates.




                                                     -13-
Optional Prepayment

         Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, the City has an option to prepay the principal components of the
Lease Payments in full, by paying the aggregate unpaid principal components of the Lease Payments, or in
part, in a prepayment amount equal to the principal amount of Lease Payments to be prepaid, together with
accrued interest to the date fixed for prepayment, together with the premium set forth for the prepayment
of Certificates. See “THE CERTIFICATES—Prepayment—Optional Prepayment.”

         Said option may be exercised with respect to Lease Payments due on and after April 15, 20_____,
in whole or in part on any date, commencing April 15, 20_____. In the event of prepayment in part, the
partial prepayment will be applied against Lease Payments in such order of payment date as will be selected
by the City. Lease Payments due after any such partial prepayment will be in the amounts set forth in a
revised Lease Payment schedule which will be provided by, or caused to be provided by, the City to the
Trustee and which will represent an adjustment to the schedule set forth in the Lease Agreement taking
into account said partial prepayment. The Trustee agrees to notify the Corporation in the event of any
prepayment of Lease Payments, as provided in the Trust Agreement.

Mandatory Prepayment from Net Proceeds of Insurance, Title Insurance or Eminent Domain

         The City may exercise its option to prepay the principal component of the Lease Payments, in whole
or in part, on any date on or after January 15, ____, by paying a prepayment price equal to the aggregate or
a portion of the unpaid principal components of the remaining Lease Payments, together with the interest
component of the Lease Payment required to be paid on such date. The City shall notify the Corporation
and the Trustee as to which of the Lease Payments it wishes to prepay. Such prepayment price shall be
deposited by the Trustee in the applicable account within the Lease Payment Fund to be applied to the
prepayment of the Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The City shall give the Trustee notice of
its intention to exercise its option not less than forty-five (45) days in advance of the date of exercise. In the
event the Lease Payments have been fully paid, and the City prepays the entire unpaid principal component
of the Lease Payments in whole, the City will be deemed to have purchased the Leased Property and title to
the Leased Property shall thereupon vest in the City, free and clear of any encumbrance created by the Lease
Agreement. See “THE CERTIFICATES—Prepayment—Extraordinary Prepayment from Net Proceeds
of Insurance and Condemnation.”

Substitution or Removal of Leased Property

        Substitution of Leased Property. The City shall have, and is granted, the option at any time and from
time to time during the term of the Lease Agreement, to substitute other land, facilities, improvements or
other property (a "Substitute Property") for the Leased Property or any portion thereof (a "Former
Property"), provided that the City shall satisfy all of the following requirements which are hereby declared
to be conditions precedent to such substitution:

                 (a) The City shall notify S&P in writing of such substitution, which notice shall contain the
        certification that all conditions for such substitution, as set forth in the Lease Agreement, are met
        with respect to such substitution;

                (b) The City shall take all actions and shall execute all documents required to subject such
        Substitute Property to the terms and provisions of the Lease Agreement, including the filing with
        the Corporation and the Trustee of an amendment to the Lease Agreement which adds thereto a



                                                       -14-
        description of such Substitute Property and deletes therefrom the description of such Former
        Property, and including the recordation of the Lease Agreement or a memorandum hereof with
        respect to such Substitute Property in the office of the Santa Clara County Recorder;

                (c) The City shall certify in writing to the Corporation and the Trustee, such certification
        to be accompanied by an appraisal prepared by an appraiser who is independent of the City, that
        the estimated fair market value of such Substitute Property is at least equal to the aggregate
        principal components of the unpaid Lease Payments;

                 (d) The City shall certify in writing to the Corporation and the Trustee that such Substitute
        Property serves the public purposes of the City and constitutes property which the City is permitted
        to lease under the laws of the State of California;

                 (e) The City shall certify in writing to the Corporation and the Trustee that the estimated
        useful life of such Substitute Property at least extends to the date on which the final Lease Payment
        becomes due and payable hereunder;

               (f) The City shall obtain a CLTA policy of title insurance meeting the requirements of the
        Lease Agreement with respect to such Substitute Property; and

                (g) The Substitute Property shall not cause the City to violate any of its covenants,
        representations and warranties made in the Lease Agreement or in the Trust Agreement.

         From and after the date on which all of the foregoing conditions precedent to such substitution are
satisfied, the term of the Lease Agreement shall cease with respect to the Former Property and shall be
continued with respect to the Substitute Property, and all references herein to the Former Property shall
apply with full force and effect to the Substitute Property. The City shall not be entitled to any reduction,
diminution, extension or other modification of the Lease Payments whatsoever as a result of such
substitution.

        Removal of Property from Leased Property. The City shall have, and is granted, the option at any time
and from time to time during the term of the Lease Agreement, to remove any property from the description
of the Leased Property, provided that the City shall satisfy all of the following requirements which are
hereby declared to be conditions precedent to such removal:

                 (a) The City shall notify S&P in writing of such removal, which notice shall contain the
        certification that all conditions for such removal, as set forth in the Lease Agreement, are met with
        respect to such removal;

                (b) The City shall file with the Corporation and the Trustee an amendment to the which
        notice shall contain the certification that all conditions for such substitution, as set forth in the Lease
        Agreement, are met with respect to such substitution which deletes therefrom the description of
        the property to be removed;

                (c) The City shall certify in writing to the Corporation and the Trustee, such certification
        to be accompanied by an appraisal prepared by an appraiser who is independent of the City, that
        the estimated fair market value of the Leased Property that will remain following such removal is at




                                                       -15-
        least equal to the aggregate principal components of the unpaid Lease Payments, and that the useful
        life of the Leased Property is not less than the final payment date of the unpaid Lease Payments.

         From and after the date on which all of the foregoing conditions precedent to such removal are
satisfied, the term of the Lease shall cease with respect to the property which is so removed. The City shall
not be entitled to any reduction, diminution, extension or other modification of the Lease Payments
whatsoever as a result of such removal.

Amendment of Lease Agreement

         Except as provided below, without the prior written consent of the Trustee, the City will not alter,
modify or cancel, or agree or consent to alter, modify or cancel the Lease Agreement, excepting only such
alteration or modification as may be permitted by the Trust Agreement.

         In addition, the Lease Agreement may be amended to obligate the City to pay additional amounts
of rental thereunder for the use and occupancy of the Leased Property or any portion thereof, but only if (a)
such additional amounts of rental do not cause the total rental payments made by the City under the Lease
Agreement to exceed the fair rental value of the Leased Property, (b) the City shall have obtained and filed
with the Trustee and the Corporation an appraisal of the Leased Property showing that the estimated fair
market value thereof is not less than the aggregate unpaid principal components of such additional amount
of rental plus the existing aggregate unpaid principal components of the Lease Payments, (c) such additional
amounts of rental shall be pledged or assigned for the payment of any bonds, notes, leases or other
obligations the proceeds of which shall be applied to finance the completion of public facilities and (d) the
City shall send notification of the additional financing to the rating agency then rating the Certificates.


                                                THE CITY

         The City is located in northern Santa Clara County, approximately 35 miles south of the City of
San Francisco. It is part of the San Francisco Bay metropolitan area. The City is considered the birthplace
of the high technology industry and a center of the Silicon Valley. Stanford University covers 700-acre area
in the City, and the City is home to high-tech leaders such as Hewlett-Packard, SAP America, Varian
Medical Systems, VMware, Tibco Software, the Electric Power Research Institute and Communications
and Power Industries and Skype. The City is also a major employment center, including U.S. Department
of Veteran Affairs’ Palo Alto Health Care System, Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, Lockheed Martin
Missiles and Space, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Stanford Shopping Center, the law offices of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.

        The City was incorporated in 1894. Its first Charter was granted by the State of California in 1909,
and the City continues to operate as a charter city. Municipal operations are conducted under the Council-
Manager form of government. The nine City Council Members are elected at large for four-year, staggered
terms. The Mayor and Vice Mayor are elected annually at the first City Council meeting in January. The
Mayor presides over all City Council meetings. The City Manager is responsible for the operation of all
municipal functions, except the offices of the City Attorney, City Clerk, and City Auditor. These officials
are appointed by, and report directly to, the City Council.

                                  CITY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Financial Statements and Budgetary Process

        The City’s accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles. The audited
financial statements also conform to the principles and standards for public financial reporting established
by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.

        Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation. The government-wide financial statements
are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are
recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are
recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as
revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met.

         Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the modified accrual basis of
accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are
considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to
pay liabilities of the current period. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under
accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures are recorded only when payment is due.

        Audited Financial Statements. The City retained the firm of Macias Gini & O’Connell LLP (MGO),
Walnut Creek, California (the “City’s Auditor”), to examine the general purpose financial statements of
the City as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017. The audited financial statements for fiscal year ended
June 30 2017, are included in APPENDIX B—COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT
OF THE CITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017. The City has not requested, and the City’s
Auditor has not provided, any review or update of such financial statements in connection with their
inclusion in this Official Statement.

         The City Council adopts a biennial budget with appropriations for all City funds prior to the
beginning of the fiscal year, which begins on July 1 of each year. The City Council has the legal authority to
amend the budget at any time during the fiscal year. The City maintains budgetary controls to ensure
compliance with legal provisions embodied in the appropriated budget approved by the City Council. The
level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated
amount) for the City’s operating budget is at the fund level. For the operating budget, the City Manager has
the authority to move appropriations between accounts (without dollar limitation) within a budget program
and within the same fund. All other appropriation changes require the approval of the City Council.

       All appropriations lapse at the end of the fiscal year unless specific carryovers are approved by the
City Council.

City Financial Management Policies

         The City Council has adopted a comprehensive set of financial management policies to provide for:
(i) establishing targeted general fund reserves; and (ii) the prudent investment of City funds. The City’s
practice is to incur debt only after deliberation over the effect of such debt on the City’s General Fund and
other resources of the City, and in those circumstances where the use of debt would be appropriate to the
scale and economic life of the asset being financed and the accumulation or availability of reserves to fund
the capital requirement.

       General Fund Reserve Policy. The following table shows the City’s general fund reserve policy
guidance, actual reserves for fiscal year 2016-17 and budgeted reserve for fiscal year 2017-18.

Principal Sources of General Fund Revenues

        Property taxes were the single largest revenue source to the general fund in fiscal year 2016-17,
representing approximately 23.9% of revenues. Sales taxes represented approximately 18.2% of revenues.

         In addition, the City receives the following local taxes:

        Utility Users Tax. The Utility Users Tax is levied on electric, gas, and water consumption, as well
as on telephone usage. Utility Users Tax represented approximately 8.7% of revenues in fiscal year 2016-
17.

         Transient Occupancy Tax. The City imposes a Transient Occupancy Tax of 14% on short term (30
days or less) room rental. Transient Occupancy Tax represented approximately 14.3% of revenues in fiscal
year 2016-17.

        Documentary Transfer Tax. The Documentary Transfer Tax is based on the number and value of
property sales.

Property Taxes

        Under Proposition 13, an amendment to the California Constitution adopted in 1978, the county
assessor’s valuation of real property is established as shown on the fiscal year 1975-76 tax bill, or, thereafter,
as the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has
occurred. Assessed value of property may be increased annually to reflect inflation at a rate not to exceed
2% per year, or reduced to reflect a reduction in the consumer price index or comparable data for the area
under taxing jurisdiction or in the event of declining property value caused by substantial damage,
destruction, market forces or other factors. As a result of these rules, real property that has been owned by
the same taxpayer for many years can have an assessed value that is much lower than that of similar
properties more recently sold, and may be lower than its own market value. Likewise, changes in ownership
of property and reassessment of such property to market value commonly will lead to increases in aggregate
assessed value even when the rate of inflation or consumer price index would not permit the full 2% increase
on any property that has not changed ownership.

        Taxes are levied by the County for each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property which is
situated in the County as of the preceding January 1. Real property which changes ownership or is newly
constructed is revalued at the time the change in ownership occurs or the new construction is completed.


                                                           -21-
The current year property tax rate will be applied to the reassessment, and the taxes will then be adjusted
by a proration factor to reflect the portion of the remaining tax year for which taxes are due.

         Local agencies and schools will share the growth of “base” sources from the tax rate area. Each
year’s growth allocation becomes part of each local agency’s allocation in the following year. The availability
of revenue from growth in the tax bases in such tax rate areas may be affected by the existence of
redevelopment agencies (including their successor agencies) which, under certain circumstances, may be
entitled to sources resulting from the increase in certain property values. State law exempts $7,000 of the
assessed valuation of an owner-occupied principal residence. This exemption does not result in any loss of
revenue to local agencies since an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been payable on such
exempt values is supplemented by the State.

         For assessment and tax collection purposes, property is classified either as “secured” or
“unsecured,” and is listed accordingly on separate parts of the assessment roll. The “secured roll” is that
part of the assessment roll containing State-assessed property and property (real or personal) for which
there is a lien on real property sufficient, in the opinion of the county assessor, to secure payment of the
taxes. All other property is “unsecured,” and is assessed on the “unsecured roll.” Secured property
assessed by the State Board of Equalization is commonly identified for taxation purposes as “utility”
property.

         Property taxes on the secured roll are due in two installments, on November 1 and February 1 of
each fiscal year, and if unpaid become delinquent on December 10 and April 10, respectively. A penalty of
10% attaches immediately to any delinquent payment. Property on the secured roll, with respect to which
taxes are delinquent, becomes tax defaulted on or about June 30 of the fiscal year. Such property may
thereafter be redeemed by payment of delinquent taxes and the delinquency penalty, plus costs and
prepayment penalty of one and one-half percent per month to the time of prepayment. If taxes are unpaid
for a period of five years or more, the property is subject to sale by the county treasurer.

         Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due as of the January 1 lien date and become delinquent, if
unpaid, on August 31. A 10% penalty attaches to delinquent unsecured taxes. If unsecured taxes are unpaid
at 5 p.m. on October 31, an additional penalty of one and one-half percent per month attaches to such taxes
on the first day of each month until paid. A county has four ways of collecting delinquent unsecured personal
property taxes: (1) bringing a civil action against the taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the
county clerk specifying certain facts in order to obtain a lien on certain property of the taxpayer; (3) filing a
certificate of delinquency for record in the county clerk and county recorder’s office in order to obtain a lien
on certain property of the taxpayer; and (4) seizing and selling personal property, improvements, or
possessory interests belonging or assessed to the delinquent taxpayer.

         Alternative Method of Tax Apportionment. The Board of Supervisors of the County has approved the
implementation of the Alternative Method of Distribution of Tax Levies and Collections and of Tax Sale
Proceeds (the “Teeter Plan”), as provided for in section 4701 et seq. of the California Revenue and Taxation
Code. The Teeter Plan guarantees distribution of 100% of the general taxes levied to the taxing entities
within the County, with the County retaining all penalties and interest penalties affixed upon delinquent
properties and redemptions of subsequent collections. Under the Teeter Plan, the County apportions
secured property taxes on a cash basis to local political subdivisions, including the City, for which the
County acts as the tax-levying or tax-collecting agency. At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the County
distributes 100% of any taxes delinquent as of June 30th to the respective taxing entities.




                                                      -22-
       The Teeter Plan is applicable to secured property tax levies. As adopted by the County, the Teeter
Plan excludes Mello-Roos Community Facilities Districts, special assessment districts, and benefit
assessment districts.

        The Teeter Plan is to remain in effect unless the Board of Supervisors of the County orders its
discontinuance or unless, prior to the commencement of any fiscal year of the County (which commences
on July 1), the Board of Supervisors receives a petition for its discontinuance joined in by resolutions
adopted by at least two-thirds of the participating revenue districts in the County, in which event the Board
of Supervisors is to order discontinuance of the Teeter Plan effective at the commencement of the
subsequent fiscal year. The Board of Supervisors may also, after holding a public hearing on the matter,
discontinue the Teeter Plan with respect to any tax levying agency or assessment levying agency in the
County if the rate of secured tax delinquency in that agency in any year exceeds 3% of the total of all taxes
and assessments levied on the secured roll in that agency. If the Teeter Plan is discontinued subsequent to
its implementation, only those secured property taxes actually collected would be allocated to political
subdivisions (including the City) for which the County acts as the tax-levying or tax-collecting agency, but
penalties and interest would be credited to the political subdivisions.

        The City is not aware of any petitions for the discontinuance of the Teeter Plan in the County.

Assessed Valuation

        The City uses the facilities of the County for tax assessment and collection. City taxes are assessed
and collected at the same times and on the same tax rolls as County, school and special district taxes.

        Under California law, two additional types of exemptions were authorized beginning in the tax year
1969-70. The first of these exempts 50% of the assessed valuation of business inventories from taxation. The
second provides an exemption of $7,000 of the assessed valuation of an owner-occupied dwelling from
which application has been made to the County Assessor. Under a recently enacted constitutional
amendment, the California Legislature can raise this exemption. Revenue estimated to be lost to local taxing
agencies due to such exemption is reimbursed from State sources. The reimbursement is based upon total
taxes due upon these exempt values and therefore is not reduced by any amounts for estimated
delinquencies.

Sales and Use Taxes

         A sales tax is imposed on the privilege of consuming personal property in California. California does
not tax services. The tax rate is established by the State Legislature, and is presently 7.25%, statewide. In
addition, many of California’s cities, counties, towns and communities have special taxing jurisdiction to
impose a transaction (sales) or use tax. These so-called district taxes increase the tax rate in a particular area
by adding the local option tax to the statewide tax. These district taxes can vary up to 1%, and more than
one district tax may be in effect for a particular location. The City’s share of sales tax is approximately 1%
when one considers the combined City share of 0.75% and the State’s 0.250% Fiscal Recovery Funding
(Triple-Flip swap) explained below. With the enactment of the Triple Flip, the City now receives the 0.250%
as reclassified revenue through property tax as an in lieu remittance, the payment of which heretofore
coincides with the County property tax calendar. The State collects and administers the tax, and makes
distributions on taxes collected within the City as follows:

        The State’s actual administrative costs with respect to the portion of sales taxes allocable to the
City are deducted before distribution and are determined on a quarterly basis.

        On March 2, 2004, voters approved a statewide bond initiative formally known as the “California
Economic Recovery Act.” This act authorized the issuance of $15 billion of Economic Recovery Bonds to
finance ongoing State budget deficits, which are payable from a fund established by the redirection of tax
revenues known as the “Triple Flip.” The State issued $11.3 billion of Economic Recovery Bonds prior to
June 30, 2004. Under the “Triple Flip,” one-quarter of local governments’ one percent share of the sales
tax imposed on taxable transactions within their jurisdiction is being redirected to the State. In an effort to
eliminate the adverse impact of the sales tax revenue redirection on local government, State legislation
provides for certain property taxes to be redirected to local government. Because these property tax monies
were previously earmarked for schools, the legislation provides for schools to receive other State general
fund revenues. It is expected that the swap of sales taxes for property taxes will terminate once the Economic
Recovery Bonds are repaid, which is currently expected to occur in approximately 9 to 13 years. See “RISK
FACTORS—State Budget Information.”

Motor Vehicle In-Lieu Tax

         Vehicle license fees are assessed in the amount of 2% of a vehicle’s depreciation market value for
the privilege of operating a vehicle on California’s public highways. A program to offset (or reduce) a portion
of the vehicle license fees (“VLF”) paid by vehicle owners was established by Chapter 322, Statutes of
1998. Beginning January 1, 1999, a permanent offset of 25% of the VLF paid by vehicle owners became
operative. Various pieces of legislation increased the amount of the offset in subsequent years to the existing
statutory level of 67.5% of 2% (resulting in the current effective rate of 0.65%). This level of offset was
estimated to provide tax relief of $3.95 billion in the fiscal year 2003-04.



                                                         -25-
         In connection with the offset of the VLF, the Legislature authorized appropriations from the State
general fund to “backfill” the offset so that the local governments, which receive all of the vehicle license
fee revenues, would not experience any loss of revenues. The legislation that established the VLF offset
program also provided that if there were insufficient general fund moneys to fully backfill the VLF offset,
the percentage offset would be reduced proportionately (i.e., the license fee payable by drivers would be
increased) to assure that local governments would not be disadvantaged. In June 2003, the State Director
of Finance ordered the suspension of VLF offsets due to a determination that insufficient general fund
moneys would be available for this purpose, and, beginning in October 2003, VLF paid by vehicle owners
were restored to the 1998 level. However, the offset suspension was rescinded by the Governor on August
17, 2003, and offset payments to local governments resumed. Local governments received backfill payments
totaling $3.80 billion in fiscal year 2002-03. Backfill payments totaling $2.65 billion were expected to be
paid to local governments in fiscal year 2003-04. The State-local agreement also provided for the repayment
in August 2006 of approximately $1.2 billion in backfill that was not received by local governments during
the time period between the suspension of the offsets and the implementation of higher fees. This
repayment obligation was codified by Proposition 1A, which was approved by voters in the November 2004
general election and was repaid early by the State in August 2005. For a description of Proposition 1A, see
“CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES, REVENUES AND
APPROPRIATIONS—Proposition 1A.”

        Beginning in fiscal year 2004-05, the State-local agreement permanently reduced the VLF rate to
0.65% and replaced the backfill with a like amount of property taxes. Subsequent to fiscal year 2004-05, each
City’s “property tax in-lieu of VLF” increased proportionally to increases in such city’s assessed valuation.
However, in fiscal years 2004-05 and 2005-06, the State “shifted” $700 million in city and county taxes to
the State’s General Fund.

        The following table sets forth the Motor Vehicle License Fees and Property Tax In-Lieu of VLF
received by the City for the last four fiscal years.

         Senate Bill 89 was signed into law as part of the State’s Fiscal Year 2011-12 Budget Act. SB 89
increases motor vehicle license fees (“VLF”) by $12. This new funding source "frees up" $300 million of
VLF revenue that had been used to fund DMV operations. Under the provisions of SB 89, this money is
transferred to a new Local Law Enforcement Services Account (“LLESA”) to fund law enforcement
grants. In addition, beginning July 1, 2011, SB 89 transfers the remaining VLF revenue previously allocated
to cities to the LLESA. Instead of cities receiving $130 million in VLF revenues, under SB 89 they would
only receive $75 million in earmarked grants.

Other Revenue Sources

       In addition to the tax revenues described above, the City receives the following general fund
revenues:

         Charges for Services. This category is comprised of external reimbursements and fee-based payments
for services provided by General Fund departments.

         Permits and Licenses. These revenues consist primarily of building construction permit fees.

         Return on Investment. These revenues consist of returns on the City’s portfolio.

     Rental Income. These revenues include income from the City’s Enterprise Funds and the Cubberley
Community Center.

        The following table shows the City’s audited other general fund revenue sources by source for the
most recent four fiscal years and budgeted other revenues for fiscal year 2017-18:

Risk Management

       Coverage. The City provides dental coverage to employees through a City plan, which is
administered by a third-party service agent. The City is self-insured for dental claims.

        The City has a workers’ compensation insurance policy with coverage up to the statutory limit set
by the State of California. The City retains the risk for the first $750,000 in losses for each accident and
employee under this policy.

        The City also has public employee dishonesty insurance with a $5,000 deductible and coverage up
to $1.0 million per loss. The Director of Administrative Service Director and City Manager each have
coverage up to $4.0 million per loss.

        The City’s property, boiler, and machinery insurance policy has various deductibles and coverage
based on the type of property.

        The City is a member of the Authority for California Cities Excess Liability (ACCEL), which
provides excess general liability insurance coverage, including auto liability, up to $100 million per
occurrence. The City retains the risk for the first $1.0 million in losses for each occurrence under this policy.

         ACCEL was established for the purpose of creating a risk management pool for central California
municipalities. ACCEL is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of representatives of its member
cities. The board controls the operations of ACCEL, including selection of claims management, general
administration and approval of the annual budget.




                                                        -28-
         The City’s deposits with ACCEL equal the ratio of the City’s payroll to the total payroll of all
entities. Actual surpluses or losses are shared according to a formula developed from overall loss costs and
spread to member entities on a percentage basis after a retrospective rating.

       During the year ended June 30, 2017, the City paid $0.9 million to ACCEL for current year
coverage.

        Claims Liability. The City provides for the uninsured portion of claims and judgments in the
General Liabilities insurance program funds. Claims and judgments, including a provision for claims
incurred but not reported, and claim adjustment expenses are recorded when a loss is deemed probable of
assertion and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable. As discussed above, the City has coverage
for such claims, but it has retained the risk for the deductible or uninsured portion of these claims.

       The City’s liability for uninsured claims is limited to dental, general liability, and workers’
compensation claims, as discussed above. Dental liability is based on a percentage of current year actual
expense.

        The City has not incurred a claim that has exceeded its insurance coverage limits in any of the last
three years, nor have there been any significant reductions in insurance coverage.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017—Notes to Basic Financial Statements—NOTE 14.

Employee Retirement Plans

         Plan Description. Substantially all permanent City employees are eligible to participate in the City’s
separate Safety (police and fire) and Miscellaneous (all other) Plans, agent multiple-employer defined
benefit pension plans administered by California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), which
acts as a common investment and administrative agent for its participating member employers. Benefits
provisions under the Plans are established by State statute and City resolution. CalPERS issues publicly
available reports that include a full description of the pension plans including benefits provisions,
assumptions and membership information.

        Benefits Provided. CalPERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living
adjustments and death benefits to Plan members, who must be public employees and beneficiaries. Benefits
are based on years of credited service (equal to one year of full-time employment), age at retirement and
final compensation. The death benefit is one of the following: the 1959 Survivor Benefit, or the pre-
retirement option 2W Death Benefit for local fire members only.

         Employees Covered. At June 30, 2016 (valuation date), the following employees were covered by the
benefit terms for each Plan.

          Contributions. Section 20814(c) of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law requires that
the employer contribution rates for all public employers be determined on an annual basis by the actuary
and shall be effective on the July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. Funding contributions for the
Plans are determined annually on an actuarial basis as of June 30 by CalPERS. The actuarially determined
rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year,
with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. The City is required to contribute the
difference between the actuarially determined rate and the contribution rate of employees.

        In April 2017, the City established a Section 115 irrevocable trust with the Public Agency
Retirement Services (PARS). The Council approved an initial deposit of $2.1 million in General Fund
proceeds into the General Fund subaccount of the City’s PARS Trust Account. The Trust Account allows
more control and flexibility in investment allocations compared to City’s portfolio which is restricted by
State regulations to fixed income instruments. As of June 30, 2017, the City reported the account balance
of $2.1 million as restricted cash in the General Benefits, an Internal Service Fund.

          Net Pension Liability. The City’s net pension liability for both Plans is measured as the total pension
liability, less the plan’s fiduciary net position. Net pension liability is measured as of June 30, 2016
(measurement date), using the Actuarial Valuation Report as of June 30, 2015 rolled forward to June 30,
2016 using standard update procedures. At June 30, 2017, the City reported a net pension liability of $377.3
million for both plans.

         The following table is based on the GASB 68 Accounting Valuation Report and shows the changes
in the net pension liability for the Miscellaneous and Safety Plans (dollars in thousands):

COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED
JUNE 30, 2017—Notes to Basic Financial Statements—NOTE 11.

         Recent Actions Taken by CalPERS. At its April 17, 2013, meeting, CalPERS’ Board of
Administration (the “Board of Administration”) approved a recommendation to change the CalPERS
amortization and smoothing policies. Prior to this change, CalPERS employed an amortization and
smoothing policy that spread investment returns over a 15-year period with experience gains and losses paid
for over a rolling 30-year period. As a result, CalPERS now employs an amortization and smoothing policy
that will pay for all gains and losses over a 20-year period with a five-year ramp-up, and five-year ramp-
down, period. The new amortization and smoothing policy was used for the first time in the June 30, 2013
actuarial valuations in setting employer contribution rates for fiscal year 2015-16.

         On February 18, 2014, the Board of Administration approved new demographic actuarial
assumptions based on a 2013 study of recent experience. The largest impact, applying to all benefit groups,
is a new 20-year mortality projection reflecting longer life expectancies and that longevity will continue to
increase. Because retirement benefits will be paid out for more years, the cost of those benefits will increase
as a result. The Board of Administration also assumed earlier retirements for Police 3%@50, Fire 3%@55,
and Miscellaneous 2.7%@55 and 3%@60, which will increase costs for those groups. As a result of these
changes, rates increased beginning in fiscal year 2016-17 (based on the June 30, 2014 valuation) with full
impact in fiscal year 2020-21.

         On November 18, 2015, the Board of Administration adopted a funding risk mitigation policy
intended to incrementally lower its discount rate – its assumed rate of investment return – in years of good
investment returns, help pay down the pension fund's unfunded liability, and provide greater predictability
and less volatility in contribution rates for employers. The policy establishes a mechanism to reduce the
discount rate by a minimum of 0.05 percentage points to a maximum of 0.25 percentage points in years
when investment returns outperform the existing discount rate, currently 7.5%, by at least four percentage
points. CalPERS staff modeling anticipates the policy will result in a lowering of the discount rate to 6.5%
in about 21 years, improve funding levels gradually over time and cut risk in the pension system by lowering
the volatility of investment returns. More information about the funding risk mitigation policy can be

        On December 21, 2016, the Board of Administration voted to lower its discount rate from the
current 7.5% to 7.0% over the next three years according to the following schedule.

                                     Fiscal Year            Discount Rate
                                      2017-18                  7.375%
                                      2018-19                  7.250
                                      2019-20                  7.000

        For public agencies like the City, the new discount rate will take effect on July 1, 2018. Lowering
the discount rate means employers that contract with CalPERS to administer their pension plans will see
increases in their normal costs and unfunded actuarial liabilities. Active members hired after January 1,
2013, under the Public Employees' Pension Reform Act will also see their contribution rates rise. The three-
year reduction of the discount rate will result in average employer rate increases of about 1 percent to 3
percent of normal cost as a percent of payroll for most miscellaneous retirement plans, and a 2 percent to 5
percent increase for most safety plans. Additionally, many CalPERS employers will see a 30 to 40 percent
increase in their current unfunded accrued liability payments. These payments are made to amortize
unfunded liabilities over 20 years to bring the pension fund to a fully funded status over the long-term.

          PERS Amortization Period Reform. On February 13, 2018 the CalPERS Board voted to shorten the
period over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized from 30 years to 20 years for new pension
liabilities. The new 20-year amortization period begins with new gains or losses accrued starting with the
June 30, 2019 actuarial valuations. The first payments on the new 20-year amortization schedule will take
place in 2021.

         A shorter amortization period will increase annual Unfunded Accrued Liability ("UAL")
contributions for cities that participate in CalPERS so long as CalPERS remains underfunded. The
shortened amortization period will also lead to reductions of periods of negative amortization of the UAL,
interest cost savings, and faster recoveries of funded status after market downturns.

        Cities that participate in CalPERS will also see additional volatility in their future UAL
contributions due to market performance as gains or losses will be amortized faster under the new
amortization period.

        The City cannot currently estimate the impact the shorter amortization period will have on its
required contributions for its Miscellaneous and Safety Plans.

Other Post-Employment Benefits

        Plan Description. In addition to providing pension benefits, the City participates in the California
Public Employees’ Medical and Health Care Act program to provide certain health care benefits for retired
employees. Employees who retire directly from the City are eligible for retiree health benefits if they retire
on or after age 50 with 5 years of service and are receiving a monthly pension from CalPERS. Details of
benefits provided to retirees are noted in the tables contained in APPENDIX B—COMPREHENSIVE
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017—Notes to
Basic Financial Statements—NOTE 12.




                                                     -32-
         In FY 2008, the City elected to participate in an irrevocable trust to provide a funding mechanism
for retiree health benefits. The Trust, California Employers’ Retirees Benefit Trust (CERBT), is
administrated by CalPERS and managed by a separately appointed board, which is not under control of the
City Council.

        Funding Policy and Actuarial Assumptions. The City’s policy is to prefund these benefits by
accumulating assets in the Trust Fund discussed above pursuant to City Council Resolution. The annual
required contribution (ARC) was determined as part of a June 30, 2015 actuarial valuation using the entry
age normal actuarial cost method. This is a projected benefit cost method, which takes into account those
benefits that are expected to be earned in the future as well as those already accrued. The actuarial
assumptions are described in detail in in APPENDIX B—COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL
REPORT OF THE CITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017—Notes to Basic Financial
Statements—NOTE 12.

       The City has calculated and recorded the Net OPEB Obligation, representing the difference
between the ARC, amortization and contributions, as presented below (dollars in thousands):

Short-Term General Fund-Secured Obligations

        The City has no outstanding short-term obligations secured by its general fund.

Long-Term General Fund-Secured Obligations

         Other than the 2002B Certificates to be refunded, the only outstanding long term general fund-
secured obligation of the City is a lease-purchase agreement entered into in 2011 with JP Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A. to finance the redemption of certain certificates of participation executed and delivered in 1998
to finance and refinance golf course improvement. Lease proceeds were $3.2 million. Principal payments
are due annually on September 1 and interest payments are due semi-annually on September 1 and March
1 at a rate of 2.49 percent.

Other Obligations

         The City has certain other outstanding obligations including utility revenue bonds and general
obligation bonds which are not secured by the City’s general fund.

     See APPENDIX B—COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30 2015—Notes to Basic Financial Statements—NOTE 7.

Overlapping Debt

        Set forth below is a direct and overlapping debt report (the “Debt Report”) prepared by California
Municipal Statistics, Inc. and effective __________ April __, 1, 2018. The Debt Report is included for
general information purposes only. The City has not reviewed the Debt Report for completeness or
accuracy and makes no representation in connection therewith.

        The Debt Report generally includes long-term obligations sold in the public credit markets by public
agencies whose boundaries overlap the boundaries of the City in whole or in part. Such long-term obligations
generally are not payable from revenues of the City (except as indicated) nor are they necessarily obligations
secured by land within the City. In many cases, long-term obligations issued by a public agency are payable
only from the general fund or other revenues of such public agency.

         The contents of the Debt Report are as follows: (1) the first column indicates the public agencies
which have outstanding debt as of the date of the Debt Report and whose territory overlaps the City; (2)
the second column shows the respective percentage of the assessed valuation of the overlapping public
agencies identified in column 1 which is represented by property located in the City; and (3) the third
column is an apportionment of the dollar amount of each public agency’s outstanding debt (which amount
is not shown in the table) to property in the City, as determined by multiplying the total outstanding debt
of each agency by the percentage of the City’s assessed valuation represented in column 2.

                                                    RISK FACTORS

         This section provides a general overview of certain risk factors which should be considered, in addition to
the other matters set forth in this Official Statement, in evaluating an investment in the Certificates. This section
is not meant to be a comprehensive or definitive discussion of the risks associated with an investment in the
Certificates, and the order in which this information is presented does not necessarily reflect the relative importance
of various risks. Potential investors in the Certificates are advised to consider the following factors, among others,
and to review this entire Official Statement to obtain information essential to the making of an informed investment
decision. Any one or more of the risk factors discussed below, among others, could lead to a decrease in the market
value and/or in the marketability of the Certificates. There can be no assurance that other risk factors not discussed
herein will not become material in the future.

Lease Payments Are Not Debt

        The obligation of the City to make the Lease Payments under the Lease Agreement does not
constitute an obligation of the City for which the City is obligated to levy or pledge any form of taxation or
for which the City has levied or pledged any form of taxation. The obligation of the City to make Lease
Payments does not constitute a debt of the City, the State of California or any political subdivision thereof
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction.

         Although the Lease Agreement does not create a pledge, lien or encumbrance upon the funds of the
City, the City is obligated under the Lease Agreement to pay the Lease Payments from any source of legally
available funds and the City has covenanted in the Lease Agreement that, for so long as the Leased Property
is available for its use, it will make the necessary annual appropriations within its budget for the Lease
Payments. The City is currently liable and may become liable on other obligations payable from general
revenues, some of which may have a priority over the Lease Payments, or which the City, in its discretion,
may determine to pay prior to the Lease Payments.


                                                             -36-
         The City has the capacity to enter into other obligations payable from the City’s general fund,
without the consent of or prior notice to the Owners of the Certificates. To the extent that additional
obligations are incurred by the City, the funds available to make Lease Payments may be decreased. In the
event the City’s revenue sources are less than its total obligations, the City could choose to fund other
municipal services before making Lease Payments. The same result could occur if, because of State
constitutional limits on expenditures, the City is not permitted to appropriate and spend all of its available
revenues. The City’s appropriations, however, have never exceeded the limitations on appropriations under
Article XIIIB of the California Constitution. For information on the City’s current limitations on
appropriations, see “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON TAXES,
REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS–Article XIIIB of the California Constitution.”

Valid and Binding Covenant to Budget and Appropriate

         Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, the City covenants to take such action as may be necessary to
include Lease Payments due in its annual budgets and to make necessary appropriations for all such
payments. Such covenants are deemed to be duties imposed by law, and it is the duty of the public officials
of the City to take such action and do such things as are required by law in the performance of the official
duty of such officials to enable the City to carry out and perform such covenants. A court, however, in its
discretion may decline to enforce such covenants. Upon delivery of the Certificates, Special Counsel will
render its opinion (substantially in the form of APPENDIX D–FORM OF OPINION OF SPECIAL
COUNSEL) to the effect that, subject to the limitations and qualifications described therein, the Lease
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the City.

Additional Obligations of the City

         The Lease Agreement does not prohibit the City from incurring additional lease and other
obligations payable from the City’s General Fund. In that regard, the City may, from time to time, incur
general fund obligations to finance public improvements (see “CITY FINANCIAL INFORMATION—
Outstanding Indebtedness”), which may also include lease obligations payable from its general fund.

Abatement

         In the event of loss or substantial interference in the use and possession by the City of all or any
portion of the Leased Property caused by material damage, title defect, destruction to or condemnation of
the Leased Property, Lease Payments will be subject to abatement. In the event that such component of the
Leased Property, if damaged or destroyed by an insured casualty, could not be replaced during the period
of time that proceeds of the City’s rental interruption insurance will be available in lieu of Lease Payments,
or in the event that casualty insurance proceeds or condemnation proceeds are insufficient to provide for
complete repair or replacement of such component of the Leased Property or prepayment of the
Certificates, there could be insufficient funds to make payments to Owners in full. Reduction in Lease
Payments due to abatement as provided in the Lease Agreement does not constitute a default thereunder.

        It is not possible to predict the circumstances under which such an abatement of rental may occur.
In addition, there is no statute, case or other law specifying how such an abatement of rental should be
measured. For example, it is not clear whether fair rental value is established as of commencement of the
lease or at the time of the abatement. If the latter, it may be that the value of the Leased Property is
substantially higher or lower than its value at the time of the execution and delivery of the Certificates.



                                                     -37-
Abatement, therefore, could have an uncertain and material adverse effect on the security for and payment
of the Certificates.

No Acceleration Upon Default

         In the event of a default, there is no remedy of acceleration of the total Lease Payments due over
the term of the Lease Agreement and the Trustee is not empowered to sell a fee simple interest in the Leased
Property and use the proceeds of such sale to prepay the Certificates or pay debt service thereon. Any suit
for money damages would be subject to limitations on legal remedies against public agencies in the State,
including a limitation on enforcement of judgments against funds needed to serve the public welfare and
interest as described below.

Risk of Uninsured Loss

         The City covenants under the Lease Agreement to maintain certain insurance policies on the
Leased Property. See “SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE CERTIFICATES—Insurance.” These
insurance policies do not cover all types of risk, and the City need not obtain insurance except as available
on the open market from reputable insurers. For instance, the City does not covenant to maintain
earthquake insurance. The Leased Property could be damaged or destroyed due to earthquake or other
casualty for which the Leased Property is uninsured. Additionally, the Leased Property could be the subject
of an eminent domain proceeding. Under these circumstances an abatement of Lease Payments could occur
and could continue indefinitely. There can be no assurance that the providers of the City’s liability and
rental interruption insurance will in all events be able or willing to make payments under the respective
policies for such loss should a claim be made under such policies. Further, there can be no assurances that
amounts received as proceeds from insurance or from condemnation of the Leased Property will be
sufficient to redeem the Certificates.

        Under the Lease Agreement the City may obtain casualty insurance which provides for a deductible
up to $250,000. Should the City be required to meet such deductible expenses, the availability of general
fund revenues to make Lease Payments may be correspondingly affected.

       The City is not obligated under the Lease Agreement to procure and maintain, or cause to be
procured and maintained, earthquake insurance on the Leased Property. Depending on its severity, an
earthquake could result in abatement of Lease Payments under the Lease Agreement. See “—Abatement.”

Eminent Domain

        If the Leased Property is taken permanently under the power of eminent domain or sold to a
government threatening to exercise the power of eminent domain, the term of the Lease Agreement will
cease as of the day possession is taken. If less than all of the Leased Property is taken permanently, or if the
Leased Property or any part thereof is taken temporarily, under the power of eminent domain, (a) the Lease
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and will not be terminated by virtue of such taking, and (b)
there will be a partial abatement of Lease Payments as a result of the application of net proceeds of any
eminent domain award to the prepayment of the Lease Payments, in an amount to be agreed upon by the
City and the Corporation such that the resulting Lease Payments represent fair consideration for the use
and occupancy of the remaining usable portion of the Leased Property. The City covenants in the Lease
Agreement to contest any eminent domain award which is insufficient to either: (i) prepay the Lease




                                                      -38-
Payments in whole, if all the Leased Property is condemned; or (ii) prepay a pro rata share of Lease
Payments, in the event that less than all of the Leased Property is condemned.

Hazardous Substances

        The existence or discovery of hazardous materials may limit the beneficial use of the Leased
Property. In general, the owners and lessees of the Leased Property may be required by law to remedy
conditions of such parcel relating to release or threatened releases of hazardous substances. The federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, sometimes referred to
as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund Act,” is the most well known and widely applicable of these laws, but
California laws with regard to hazardous substances are also similarly stringent. Under many of these laws,
the owner or lessee is obligated to remedy a hazardous substance condition of the property whether or not
the owner or lessee had anything to do with creating or handling the hazardous substance.

         Further it is possible that the beneficial use of the Leased Property may be limited in the future
resulting from the current existence on the Leased Property of a substance currently classified as hazardous
but which has not been released or the release of which is not presently threatened, or may arise in the future
resulting from the current existence on the Leased Property of a substance not presently classified as
hazardous but which may in the future be so classified. Further, such liabilities may arise not simply from
the existence of a hazardous substance but from the method in which it is handled. All of these possibilities
could significantly limit the beneficial use of the Leased Property.

       The City is unaware of the existence of hazardous substances on the Leased Property site which
would materially interfere with the beneficial use thereof.

Earthquakes

          The City is not legally obligated under the Lease Agreement to maintain, or cause to be maintained,
earthquake insurance on the Leased Property and no assurance is made that any earthquake insurance will
be maintained. If there were to be an occurrence of severe seismic activity in the City, there could be
substantial damage to and interference with the City’s right to use and occupy all or a portion of the Leased
Property, which could result in Lease Payments being subject to abatement. Additionally, severe seismic
activity in the City could impact the City’s general fund expenditures. See “CERTAIN RISK FACTORS—
Abatement” above.

Bankruptcy

        The City is a unit of State government and therefore is not subject to the involuntary procedures of
the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). However, pursuant to Chapter 9 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the City may seek voluntary protection from its creditors for purposes of adjusting its
debts. A City or Authority bankruptcy petition could have a material adverse effect on the payment of the
Certificates. The following paragraphs present a discussion of certain potential consequences surrounding
a potential City or Authority bankruptcy. It is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all potential
adverse consequences or potential outcomes.

         In the event the City were to become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, the City would be
entitled to all of the protective provisions of the Bankruptcy Code as applicable in a Chapter 9 proceeding.
Among the adverse effects of such a bankruptcy might be: (i) the application of the automatic stay provisions



                                                     -39-
of the Bankruptcy Code, which, until relief is granted, would prevent collection of payments from the City
or the commencement of any judicial or other action for the purpose of recovering or collecting a claim
against the City; (ii) the avoidance of preferential transfers occurring during the relevant period prior to the
filing of a bankruptcy petition; (iii) the existence of unsecured or court-approved secured debt which may
have a priority of payment superior to that of Owners of Certificates; and (iv) the possibility of the adoption
of a plan for the adjustment of the City’s debt (a “Plan”) without the consent of the Trustee or all of the
Owners of Certificates, which Plan may restructure, delay, compromise or reduce the amount of any claim
of the Owners if the Bankruptcy Court finds that the Plan is fair and equitable.

        In addition, the City could either reject the Lease or assume the Lease despite any provision of the
Lease which makes the bankruptcy or insolvency of the City an event of default thereunder. In the event
the City rejects the Lease, the Trustee, on behalf of the Owners of the Certificates, would have a pre-petition
claim that may be limited under the Bankruptcy Code and treated in a manner under a Plan over the
objections of the Trustee or Owners of the Certificates. Moreover, such rejection would terminate the Lease
and the City’s obligations to make payments thereunder.

         The Authority is a public agency and, like the City, is not subject to the involuntary procedures of
the Bankruptcy Code. The Authority may also seek voluntary protection under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy
Code. In the event the Authority were to become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, the Authority would
be entitled to all of the protective provisions of the Bankruptcy Code as applicable in a Chapter 9 proceeding.
Such a bankruptcy could adversely affect the payments under the Indenture. Among the adverse effects
might be: (i) the application of the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, which, until relief is
granted, would prevent collection of payments from the Authority or the commencement of any judicial or
other action for the purpose of recovering or collecting a claim against the Authority; (ii) the avoidance of
preferential transfers occurring during the relevant period prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition; (iii)
the existence of unsecured or court-approved secured debt which may have priority of payment superior to
that of the Owners of the Certificates; and (iv) the possibility of the adoption of a plan for the adjustment of
the Authority’s debt without the consent of the Trustee or all of the Owners of the Certificates, which plan
may restructure, delay, compromise or reduce the amount of any claim of the Owners if the Bankruptcy
Court finds that the Plan is fair and equitable.

Pension Benefit Liability

         Many factors influence the amount of the City’s pension benefit liabilities, including, without
limitation, inflationary factors, changes in statutory provisions of PERS retirement system laws, changes in
the level of benefits provided or in the contribution rates of the City, increases or decreases in the number
of covered employees, changes in actuarial assumptions or methods (including but not limited to the
assumed rate of return), and differences between actual and anticipated investment experience of PERS.
Any of these factors could give rise to additional liability of the City to its pension plans as a result of which
the City would be obligated to make additional payments to its pension plans in order to fully fund the City’s
obligations to its pension plans.

Early Prepayment Risk

         Early prepayment of the Certificates may occur in whole or in part without premium, on any date
if the Leased Property or a portion thereof is lost, destroyed or damaged beyond repair or taken by eminent
domain and from the proceeds of title insurance, or on any Interest Payment Date, without a premium (see




                                                      -40-
“THE CERTIFICATES - Prepayment”), if the City exercises its right to prepay Lease Payments in whole
or in part pursuant to the provisions of the Lease Agreement and the Trust Agreement.

Limitations on Remedies

        The enforcement of any remedies provided in the Lease Agreement and the Trust Agreement could
prove both expensive and time consuming. Although the Lease Agreement provides that if the City defaults
the Trustee may reenter the Leased Property and re-let the Leased Property, portions of the Leased
Property may not be easily recoverable, and even if recovered, could be of little value to others because of
the Leased Property’s specialized nature. Additionally, the Trustee may have limited ability to re-let the
Leased Property to provide a source of rental payments sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the
Certificates so as to preserve the tax-exempt nature of interest with respect to the Certificates.
Furthermore, due to the governmental nature of the Leased Property, it is not certain whether a court would
permit the exercise of the remedy of re-letting with respect thereto.

         Alternatively, the Trustee may terminate the Lease Agreement and proceed against the City to
recover damages pursuant to the Lease Agreement. Any suit for money damages would be subject to
limitations on legal remedies against public agencies in the State, including a limitation on enforcement of
judgments against funds needed to serve the public welfare and interest.

         The rights of the Owners of the Certificates are subject to certain limitations on legal remedies
against cities, redevelopment agencies and other governmental entities in the State, including but not
limited to a limitation on enforcement against funds that are otherwise needed to serve the public welfare
and interest. Additionally, the rights of the Owners of the Certificates may be subject to (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws limiting or otherwise affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally (as such laws are now or hereafter may be in effect), (ii) equity principles
(including but not limited to concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing) and the
possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or law, (iii) the exercise by the United States of America of the powers delegated to it
by the Constitution, and (iv) the reasonable and necessary exercise, in certain exceptional situations, of the
police powers inherent in the sovereignty of the State and its governmental bodies in the interest of serving
a significant and legitimate public purpose. Under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United
States Code), which governs bankruptcy proceedings for public agencies, there are no involuntary petitions
in bankruptcy. If the City were to file a petition under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Owners, the
Trustee and the Corporation could be prohibited or severely restricted from taking any steps to enforce
their rights under the Lease Agreement and from taking any steps to collect amounts due from the City
under the Lease Agreement.

         Special Counsel has limited its opinion as to the enforceability of the Lease Agreement to the extent
that enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, moratorium, or other similar laws affecting generally the enforcement of creditor’s rights, by
equitable principles and by the exercise of judicial discretion. Additionally, the Certificates are not subject
to acceleration in the event of the breach of any covenant or duty under the Lease Agreement. The lack of
availability of certain remedies or the limitation of remedies may entail risks of delay, limitation or
modification of the rights of the Owners.

Dependence on State for Certain Revenues




                                                     -41-
        A number of the City’s revenues are collected and dispersed by the State (such as sales tax and
motor-vehicle license fees) or allocated in accordance with State law (most importantly, property taxes).
Therefore, State budget decisions can have an impact on City finances. In the event of a material economic
downturn in the State, there can be no assurance that any resulting revenue shortfalls to the State will not
reduce revenues to local governments (including the City) or shift financial responsibility for programs to
local governments as part of the State’s efforts to address any such related State financial difficulties.

Risk of Tax Audit

        In December 1999, as a part of a larger reorganization, the Internal Revenue Service (the
“Service”), commenced operation of its Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division (the “TE/GE
Division”), as the successor to its Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations division. The new TE/GE
Division has a subdivision that is specifically devoted to tax-exempt bond compliance. Public statements by
Service officials indicate that the number of tax-exempt bond examinations (which would include securities
such as the Certificates) is expected to increase significantly under the new TE/GE Division. There is no
assurance that if an examination of the Certificates was undertaken that it would not adversely affect the
market value of the Certificates. See “TAX MATTERS.” The City has not been contacted by the Service
regarding the examination of any of its bond transactions.

No Reserve Fund

        No debt service reserve fund has been established with respect to the Certificates.

Loss of Tax Exemption

         As discussed under the caption “TAX MATTERS,” in order to maintain the exclusion from gross
income for federal income tax purposes of the interest with respect to the Certificates, the City has
covenanted in the Lease Agreement not to take any action, or fail to take any action, if such action or failure
to take such action would adversely affect the exclusion from gross income of interest with respect to the
Certificates under section 103 of the Code. Interest with respect to the Certificates could become includable
in gross income for purposes of Federal income taxation retroactive to the date the Certificates were
delivered, as a result of acts or omissions of the City in violation of the Code. Should such an event of
taxability occur, the Certificates are not subject to early prepayment and will remain outstanding to maturity
or until prepaid under the optional prepayment or mandatory sinking fund prepayment provisions of the
Trust Agreement.

Secondary Market Risk

        There can be no assurance that there will be a secondary market for purchase or sale of the
Certificates, and from time to time there may be no market for them, depending upon prevailing market
conditions, the financial condition or market position of firms who may make the secondary market and the
financial condition of the City.

Changes in Law

        There can be no assurance that the electorate of the State will not at some future time adopt
additional initiatives or that the Legislature will not enact legislation that will amend the laws or the




                                                     -42-
Constitution of the State resulting in a reduction of the general fund revenues of the City and consequently,
having an adverse effect on the security for the Certificates.

Taxability Risk

        As discussed under the caption “TAX MATTERS,” interest with respect to the Certificates could
become includable in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation retroactive to the date the
Certificates were delivered, as a result of future acts or omissions of the City in violation of its covenants in
the Lease Agreement. There is no provision in the Certificates or the Trust Agreement for special
prepayment or acceleration or for the payment of additional interest should such an event of taxability occur,
and the Certificates will remain outstanding until maturity or until redeemed under one of the other
prepayment provisions contained in the Trust Agreement.

         In addition, as discussed under the caption “TAX MATTERS,” Congress is or may be considering
in the future legislative proposals, including some that carry retroactive effective dates, that, if enacted,
would alter or eliminate the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on
municipal bonds, such as the Certificates. Prospective purchasers of the Certificates should consult their
own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed federal tax legislation. The City can provide no
assurance that federal tax law will not change while the Certificates are outstanding or that any such changes
will not adversely affect the exclusion of interest with respect to the Certificates from gross income for
federal income tax purposes. If the exclusion of interest with respect to the Certificates from gross income
for federal income tax purposes were amended or eliminated, it is likely that the market price for the
Certificates would be adversely impacted.

         Information regarding the State Budget is regularly available at various State-maintained websites. The
Fiscal Year 2017-18 State Budget further described below may be found at the website of the Department of
Finance, www.dof.ca.gov, under the heading “California Budget.” Additionally, an impartial analysis of the
State’s Budgets is posted by the Office of the Legislative Analyst at www.lao.ca.gov. The information referred to is
prepared by the respective State agency maintaining each website and not by the Authority or the City, and neither
the Authority nor City take responsibility for the continued accuracy of the internet addresses or for the accuracy,
completeness or timeliness of information posted there, and such information is not incorporated herein by these

2018-19 Proposed State Budget

         On January 10, 2018, the Governor released his proposed State budget for Fiscal Year 2018-19 (the
“2018-19 Proposed State Budget”). The 2018-19 Proposed State Budget estimates that total resources
available in Fiscal Year 2017-18 totaled approximately $131.86 billion (including a prior year balance of
$4.61 billion) and total expenditures in Fiscal Year 2017-18 totaled approximately $126.51 billion. The
2018-19 Proposed State Budget projects total resources available for Fiscal Year 2018-19 of $135.14 billion,
inclusive of revenues and transfers of $129.79 billion and a prior year balance of $5.35 billion. The 2018-19
Proposed State Budget projects total expenditures of $131.69 billion. The 2018-19 Proposed State Budget
proposes to allocate $1.17 billion of the State’s General Fund’s projected fund balance to the Reserve for
Liquidation of Encumbrances and $2.29 billion of such fund balance to the State’s Special Fund for
Economic Uncertainties.



                                                        -43-
         According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the 2018-19 Proposed State Budget proposes to end
Fiscal Year 2018-19 with $15.7 billion in total reserves, which would consist of $13.5 billion in the State’s
constitutional rainy-day fund (reserves available for future budget emergencies) and $2.3 billion in
discretionary reserves (available for any purpose). The budget would increase the rainy-day fund by over $5
billion in Fiscal Year 2018-19, including an optional $3.5 billion deposit. The 2018-19 Proposed State
Budget deposits enough reserves into the State’s rainy-day fund that it reaches its constitutional maximum.
The Legislative Analyst’s Office advises that this approach may be prudent in light of economic and federal
budget uncertainty, but comes with trade-offs for the State, including requiring rainy day reserves in excess
of 10 percent to be spent on infrastructure projects.

         The final Fiscal Year 2018-19 State budget, which requires approval by a majority vote of each
house of the State Legislature, may differ substantially from the 2018-19 Proposed State Budget and may
be affected by national and State economic conditions and other factors which the City cannot predict. The
Governor cautions that there are uncertainties that must be considered as the 2018-19 Proposed State
Budget is revised, including the impact of federal tax reform and federal healthcare legislation. Accordingly,
the City does not provide any assurances that there will not be any changes in the final Fiscal Year 2018-19
State budget from the 2018-19 Proposed State Budget, nor can the City predict the impact that the final
Fiscal Year 2018-19 State budget, or subsequent budgets, will have on its finances and operations.

      The full summary of the Governor’s Budget Proposal can be viewed at www.ebudget.ca.gov or
www.dof.ca.gov.

Future State Budgets

        The City receives a portion of its funding from the State. Changes in the revenues received by the
State can affect the amount of funding, if any, to be received from the State by the City and other cities in
the State.

        The City cannot predict the extent of the budgetary problems the State will encounter in this Fiscal
Year or in any future fiscal years, and, it is not clear what measures would be taken by the State to balance
its budget, as required by law. In addition, the City cannot predict the final outcome of current and future
State budget negotiations, the impact that such budgets will have on its finances and operations or what
actions will be taken in the future by the State Legislature and Governor to deal with changing State
revenues and expenditures. Current and future State budgets will be affected by national and State
economic conditions and other factors, including the current economic downturn, over which the City has
no control. See also “RISK FACTORS—Dependence on State for Certain Revenues.”


                   CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON
                       TAXES, REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS

Article XIIIA of the California Constitution

        On June 6, 1978, California voters approved an amendment (commonly known as both Proposition
13 and the Jarvis-Gann Initiative) to the California Constitution. This amendment, which added Article
XIIIA to the California Constitution, among other things affects the valuation of real property for the
purpose of taxation in that it defines the full cash property value to mean “the county assessor’s valuation



                                                     -44-
of real property as shown on the 1975-76 tax bill under “full cash value,” or thereafter, the appraised value
of real property newly constructed, or when a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment.”
The full cash value may be adjusted annually to reflect inflation at a rate not to exceed 2% per year, or a
reduction in the consumer price index or comparable local data at a rate not to exceed 2% per year, or
reduced in the event of declining property value caused by damage, destruction or other factors including a
general economic downturn. The amendment further limits the amount of any ad valorem tax on real
property to one percent of the full cash value except that additional taxes may be levied to pay debt service
on indebtedness approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978, and bonded indebtedness for the acquisition
or improvement of real property approved on or after July 1, 1978 by two-thirds of the votes cast by the
voters voting on the proposition.

        Legislation enacted by the California Legislature to implement Article XIIIA provides that all
taxable property is shown at full assessed value as described above. In conformity with this procedure, all
taxable property value included in this Official Statement (except as noted) is shown at 100% of assessed
value and all general tax rates reflect the $1 per $100 of taxable value. Tax rates for voter approved bonded
indebtedness and pension liability are also applied to 100% of assessed value.

         The voters of the State subsequently approved various measures which further amended Article
XIIIA. One such amendment generally provides that the purchase or transfer of (i) real property between
spouses or (ii) the principal residence and the first $1,000,000 of the Full Cash Value of other real property
between parents and children, do not constitute a “purchase” or “change of ownership” triggering
reappraisal under Article XIIIA. Other amendments permitted the State Legislature to allow persons over
the age of 55 who meet certain criteria or “severely disabled homeowners” who sell their residence and buy
or build another of equal or lesser value within two years in the same county, to transfer the old residence’s
assessed value to the new residence. Other amendments permit the State Legislature to allow persons who
are either 55 years of age or older, or who are “severely disabled,” to transfer the old residence’s assessed
value to their new residence located in either the same or a different county and acquired or newly
constructed within two years of the sale of their old residence.

        In the November 1990 election, the voters approved an amendment of Article XIIIA to permit the
State Legislature to exclude from the definition of “new construction” certain additions and improvements,
including seismic retrofitting improvements and improvements utilizing earthquake hazard mitigation
technologies constructed or installed in existing buildings after November 6, 1990.

       Article XIIIA has also been amended to provide that there would be no increase in the Full Cash
Value base in the event of reconstruction of the property damaged or destroyed in a disaster.

        Section 51 of the Revenue and Taxation Code permits county assessors who have reduced the
assessed valuation of a property as a result of natural disasters, economic downturns or other factors, to
subsequently “recapture” such value (up to the pre-decline value of the property) at an annual rate higher
than 2%, depending on the assessor’s measure of the restoration of value of the damaged property.

         Section 4 of Article XIIIA also provides that cities, counties and special districts cannot, without a
two-thirds vote of the qualified electors, impose special taxes, which has been interpreted to include special
fees in excess of the cost of providing the services or facility for which the fee is charged, or fees levied for
general revenue purposes.

         Both the California State Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have upheld the
validity of Article XIIIA.

Article XIIIB of the California Constitution

         On November 6, 1979, California voters approved Proposition 4, the Gann Initiative, which added
Article XIIIB to the California Constitution. In June 1990, Article XIIIB was amended by the voters through
their approval of Proposition 111. Article XIIIB of the California Constitution limits the annual
appropriations of the State and any city, county, school district, authority or other political subdivision of
the State to the level of appropriations for the prior fiscal year, as adjusted annually for changes in the cost
of living, population and services rendered by the governmental entity. The “base year” for establishing
such appropriation limit is fiscal year 1978-79. Increases in appropriations by a governmental entity are also
permitted (1) if financial responsibility for providing services is transferred to the governmental entity, or
(2) for emergencies so long as the appropriations limits for the three years following the emergency are
reduced to prevent any aggregate increase above the Constitutional limit. Decreases are required where
responsibility for providing services is transferred from the government entity.

         Appropriations subject to Article XIIIB include generally any authorization to expend during the
fiscal year the proceeds of taxes levied by the State or other entity of local government, exclusive of certain
State subventions, refunds of taxes, benefit payments from retirement, unemployment insurance and
disability insurance funds. Appropriations subject to limitation pursuant to Article XIIIB do not include
debt service on indebtedness existing or legally authorized as of January 1, 1979, on bonded indebtedness
thereafter approved according to law by a vote of the electors of the issuing entity voting in an election for
such purpose, appropriations required to comply with mandates of courts or the Federal government,
appropriations for qualified outlay projects, and appropriations by the State of revenues derived from any
increase in gasoline taxes and motor vehicle weight fees above January 1, 1990 levels. “Proceeds of taxes”
include, but are not limited to, all tax revenues and the proceeds to any entity of government from (1)
regulatory licenses, user charges, and user fees to the extent such proceeds exceed the cost of providing the
service or regulation, (2) the investment of tax revenues and (3) certain State subventions received by local
governments. As amended by Proposition 111, the appropriations limit is tested over consecutive two-year
periods. Any excess of the aggregate “proceeds of taxes” received by the City over such two-year period
above the combined appropriations limits for those two years is to be returned to taxpayers by reductions in
tax rates or fee schedules over the subsequent two years.

         As amended in June 1990, the appropriations limit for the City in each year is based on the limit for
the prior year, adjusted annually for changes in the costs of living and changes in population, and adjusted,
where applicable, for transfer of financial responsibility of providing services to or from another unit of
government. The change in the cost of living is, at the City’s option, either (1) the percentage change in
California per capita personal income, or (2) the percentage change in the local assessment roll for the
jurisdiction due to the addition of nonresidential new construction. The measurement of change in
population is a blended average of statewide overall population growth, and change in attendance at local
school and community college (“K-14”) districts.

        Article XIIIB permits any government entity to change the appropriations limit by vote of the
electorate in conformity with statutory and Constitutional voting requirements, but any such voter-
approved change can only be effective for a maximum of four years.




                                                      -46-
        The City’s appropriations limit for Fiscal Year 2018 has been established at $158,370,000. The
impact of the appropriations limit on the City’s financial needs in the future is unknown.

Proposition 62

         Proposition 62 was adopted by the voters at the November 4, 1986, general election which (a)
requires that any new or higher taxes for general governmental purposes imposed by local governmental
entities such as the City be approved by a two-thirds vote of the governmental entity’s legislative body and
by a majority vote of the voters of the governmental entity voting in an election on the tax, (b) requires that
any special tax (defined as taxes levied for other than general governmental purposes) imposed by a local
government entity be approved by a two-thirds vote of the voters of the governmental entity voting in an
election on the tax, (c) restricts the use of revenues from a special tax to the purposes or for the service for
which the special tax was imposed, (d) prohibits the imposition of ad valorem taxes on real property by local
governmental entities except as permitted by Article XIIIA of the California Constitution, (e) prohibits the
imposition of transaction taxes and sales taxes on the sale of real property by local governmental entities,
and (f) requires that any tax imposed by a local governmental entity on or after August 1, 1985, be ratified
by a majority vote of the voters voting in an election on the tax within two years of the adoption of the
initiative or be terminated by November 15, 1988.

        On September 28, 1995, the California Supreme Court, in the case of Santa Clara City Local
Transportation Authority v. Guardino, upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 62. In this case, the court
held that a county-wide sales tax of one-half of one percent was a special tax that, under Section 53722 of
the Government Code, required a two-thirds voter approval. The county-wide sales tax at issue received an
affirmative vote of only 54.1% and was found to be invalid.

         Following the California Supreme Court’s decision upholding Proposition 62, several actions were
filed challenging taxes imposed by public agencies since the adoption of Proposition 62. On June 4, 2001,
the California Supreme Court released its decision in one of these cases, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association v. City of La Habra, et al. (“La Habra”). In this case, the court held that public agency’s
continued imposition and collection of a tax is an ongoing violation, upon which the statute of limitations
period begins anew with each collection. The court also held that, unless another statute or constitutional
rule provided differently, the statute of limitations for challenges to taxes subject to Proposition 62 is three
years. Accordingly, a challenge to a tax subject to Proposition 62 may only be made for those taxes received
within three years of the date the action is brought.

Proposition 218

         Proposition 218. On November 5, 1996, California voters approved Proposition 218—Voter
Approval for Local Government Taxes—Limitation on Fees, Assessments, and Charges—Initiative
Constitutional Amendment. Proposition 218 added Articles XIIIC and XIIID to the California Constitution,
imposing certain vote requirements and other limitations on the imposition of new or increased taxes,
assessments and property-related fees and charges. Proposition 218 states that all taxes imposed by local
governments shall be deemed to be either general taxes or special taxes. Special purpose districts, including
school districts, have no power to levy general taxes. No local government may impose, extend or increase
any general tax unless and until such tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote. No
local government may impose, extend or increase any special tax unless and until such tax is submitted to
the electorate and approved by a two-thirds vote.




                                                      -47-
         Proposition 218 also provides that no tax, assessment, fee or charge shall be assessed by any agency
upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership except: (i) the ad
valorem property tax imposed pursuant to Article XIII and Article XIIIA of the California Constitution, (ii)
any special tax receiving a two-thirds vote pursuant to Section 4 of Article XIIIA the California Constitution,
and (iii) assessments, fees, and charges for property related services as provided in Article XIIID.
Proposition 218 added voter requirements for assessments and fees and charges imposed as an incident of
property ownership, other than fees and charges for sewer, water, and refuse collection services. In addition,
all assessments and fees and charges imposed as an incident of property ownership, including sewer, water,
and refuse collection services, are subjected to various additional procedures, such as hearings and stricter
and more individualized benefit requirements and findings. The effect of such provisions will presumably
be to increase the difficulty a local agency will have in imposing, increasing or extending such assessments,
fees and charges.

        Proposition 218 also extended the initiative power to reducing or repealing any local taxes,
assessments, fees and charges. This extension of the initiative power is not limited to taxes imposed on or
after November 6, 1996, the effective date of Proposition 218, and could result in retroactive repeal or
reduction in any existing taxes, assessments, fees and charges, subject to overriding federal constitutional
principles relating to the impairment of contracts.

        Proposition 218 provides that, effective July 1, 1997, fees that are charged “as an incident of
property ownership” may not “exceed the funds required to provide the property related services” and
may only be charged for services that are “immediately available to the owner of the property.”

          The City does not expect the application of Proposition 218 will have a material adverse impact on
its ability to pay Lease Payments.

Proposition 1A of 2004

         The California Constitution and existing statutes give the legislature authority over property taxes,
sales taxes and the vehicle license fee (the “VLF”). The legislature has authority to change tax rates, the
items subject to taxation and the distribution of tax revenues among local governments, schools, and
community college districts. The State has used this authority for many purposes, including increasing
funding for local services, reducing State costs, reducing taxation, addressing concerns regarding funding
for particular local governments, and restructuring local finance.

        The California Constitution generally requires the State to reimburse the local governments when
the State “mandates” a new local program or higher level of service. Due to the ongoing financial difficulties
of the State, it has not provided in recent years reimbursements for many mandated costs. In other cases,
the State has “suspended” mandates, eliminating both responsibility of the local governments for
complying with the mandate and the need for State reimbursements.

         The 2004 Budget Act, related legislation and the enactment of Proposition 1A of 2004 (described
below) dramatically changed the State-local fiscal relationship. These constitutional and statutory changes
implemented an agreement negotiated between the Governor and local government officials (the “State-
local agreement”) in connection with the 2004 Budget Act.

         One change related to the reduction of the VLF rate from 2% to 0.65% of the market value of the
vehicle. In order to protect local governments, which had previously received all VLF revenues, the 1.35



                                                     -48-
percent reduction in VLF revenue to cities and counties from this rate change was backfilled by an increase
in the amount of property tax revenues they receive. This worked to the benefit of local governments,
because the backfill amount annually increases in proportion to the growth in secured roll property tax
revenues, which has historically grown at a higher rate than VLF revenues. Proposition 1A of 2004 requires
the State to provide local governments with equal replacement revenues.

         On November 3, 2004 the voters of the State approved Proposition 1A (“Proposition 1A of 2004”).
Proposition 1A of 2004 amended the State Constitution to, among other things, reduce the Legislature’s
authority over local government revenue sources by placing restrictions on the State’s access to local
governments’ property, sales, and VLF revenues as of November 3, 2004. In addition, the State cannot
reduce the local sales tax rate or restrict the authority of the local governments to impose or change the
distribution of the Statewide local sales tax. Proposition 1A of 2004 generally prohibits the State from
mandating activities on cities, counties, or special districts without providing the funding needed to comply
with the mandates, and if the State does not provide funding for the activity that has been determined to be
mandated, the requirement on cities, counties, or special districts to abide by the mandate is suspended.
Proposition 1A of 2004 also expanded the definition of what constitutes a mandate to encompass State
action that transfers to cities, counties, and special districts financial responsibility for a required program
for which the State previously had partial or complete responsibility. The State mandate provisions of
Proposition 1A of 2004 do not apply to schools or community colleges or to mandates relating to employee
rights.

        Pursuant to statutory changes made in conjunction with amendments to the fiscal year 2008-09
State Budget Act, the fiscal year 2012-10 State Budget Act and related budget legislation adopted by the
State Legislature and signed by the Governor in February 2012 (collectively, the “February 2012 Budget
Package”), the VLF rate increased from 0.65% to 1.15% effective May 19, 2012. Of this 0.50% increase,
0.35% will flow to the State General Fund, and 0.15% will support various law enforcement programs
previously funded by the State General Fund. This increased VLF rate will be effective through fiscal year
2010-11.

Proposition 22

         Proposition 22 (“Proposition 22”), which was approved by California voters in November 2010,
prohibits the State, even during a period of severe fiscal hardship, from delaying the distribution of tax
revenues for transportation, redevelopment, or local government projects and services and prohibits fuel
tax revenues from being loaned for cash-flow or budget balancing purposes to the State General Fund or
any other State fund. Due to the prohibition with respect to State’s ability to take, reallocate, and borrow
money raised by local governments for local purposes, Proposition 22 supersedes certain provisions of
Proposition 1A of 2004. See “ – Proposition 1A” herein. In addition, Proposition 22 generally eliminates
the State’s authority to temporarily shift property taxes from cities, counties, and special districts to
schools, temporarily increase school and community college district’s share of property tax revenues,
prohibits the State from borrowing or redirecting redevelopment property tax revenues or requiring
increased pass-through payments thereof, and prohibits the State from reallocating vehicle license fee
revenues to pay for State imposed mandates. In addition, Proposition 22 requires a two-thirds vote of each
house of the State Legislature and a public hearing process to be conducted in order to change the amount
of fuel excise tax revenues shared with cities and counties. The LAO states that Proposition 22 will prohibit
the State from enacting new laws that require redevelopment agencies to shift funds to schools or other
agencies.




                                                      -49-
         Proposition 22 prohibits the State from borrowing sales taxes or excise taxes on motor vehicle fuels
or changing the allocations of those taxes among local government except pursuant to specified procedures
involving public notices and hearings. In addition, Proposition 22 requires that the State apply the formula
setting forth the allocation of State fuel tax revenues to local agencies revert to the formula in effect on June
30, 2009. The LAO anticipates that Proposition 22 will require the State to adopt alternative actions to
address its fiscal and policy objectives, particularly with respect to short-term cash flow need. The County
does not believe that the adoption of Proposition 22 will have a significant impact on its revenues and
expenditures during Fiscal Year 2012-13.

Proposition 26

         Proposition 26 (“Proposition 26”), which was approved by California voters on November 2, 2010,
revises the California Constitution to expand the definition of “taxes.” Proposition 26 re-categorizes many
State and local fees as taxes and specifies a requirement of two-thirds voter approval for taxes levied by local
governments.

         Proposition 26 requires the State obtain the approval of two-thirds of both houses of the State
Legislature for any proposed change in State statutes, which would result in any taxpayer paying a higher
tax. Proposition 26 eliminates the previous practice whereby a tax increase coupled with a tax reduction that
resulted in an overall neutral fiscal effect was subject only to a majority vote in the State Legislature.
Furthermore, pursuant to Proposition 26, any increase in a fee above the amount needed to provide the
specific service or benefit is deemed to be a tax and the approval thereof will require such two-thirds vote
of approval to be effective. In addition, for State imposed fees and charges, any fee or charge adopted after
January 1, 2010 with a majority vote of approval of the State Legislature which would have required a two-
thirds vote of approval of the State Legislature if Proposition 26 were effective at the time of such adoption
is repealed as of November 2011 absent the re-adoption by the requisite two-thirds vote.

         Proposition 26 amends Article XIII C of the State Constitution to state that a “tax” means a levy,
charge or exaction of any kind imposed by a local government, except (1) a charge imposed for a specific
benefit conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and
which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit or granting the
privilege; (2) a charge imposed for a specific government service or product provided directly to the payor
that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local
government of providing the service or product; (3) a charge imposed for the reasonable regulatory costs to
a local government for issuing licenses and permits, performing investigations, inspections and audits, 30
enforcing agricultural marketing orders, and the administrative enforcement and adjudication thereof; (4)
a charge imposed for entrance to or use of local government property or the purchase rental or lease of local
government property; (5) a fine, penalty, or other monetary charge imposed by the judicial branch of
government or a local government as a result of a violation of law; (6) a charge imposed as a condition of
property development; or (7) assessments and property related fees imposed in accordance with the
provisions of Proposition 218. See “ – Proposition 218.”

          Proposition 26 applies to any levy, charge or exaction imposed, increased, or extended by local
government on or after November 3, 2010, unless exempted, as stated above. Accordingly, fees adopted
prior to that date are not subject to the measure until they are increased or extended or if it is determined
that an exemption applies. As of the date hereof, none of the County’s fees or charges has been challenged
in a court of law in connection with the requirements of Proposition 26.




                                                      -50-
        If the local government specifies how the funds from a proposed local tax are to be used, the
approval will be subject to a two-thirds voter requirement. If the local government does not specify how the
funds from a proposed local tax are to be used, the approval will be subject to a fifty percent voter
requirement. Proposed local government fees that are not subject to Proposition 26 generally are subject to
the approval of a majority of the governing body. In general, proposed property charges will be subject to a
majority vote of approval by the governing body although certain proposed property charges will also require
approval by a majority of the affected property owners.

Future Initiatives

         Articles XIIIA, XIIIB, XIIIC and XIIID and Propositions 1A, 22, and 26 were each adopted as
measures that qualified for the ballot pursuant to the State’s initiative process. The limitations imposed
upon the City by these provisions hinder the City’s ability to raise revenues through taxes or otherwise and
may therefore prevent the City from meeting increased expenditure requirements. From time to time, other
initiative measures could be adopted, some of which may place further limitations on the ability of the State,
the City or local districts to increase revenues or to spend money or which could have other financially
adverse effects such as requiring the City to undertake new responsibilities. Such other initiatives could
have a material adverse effect on the City’s financial condition.


                                      ABSENCE OF LITIGATION

         At the time of delivery of and payment for the Certificates, the City will certify that there is no

         The City’s annual filings for Fiscal Years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 in connection with
certain outstanding utility revenue bonds omitted certain information relating to the top ten customers of
its gas system. For Fiscal Years 2013 and 2015, certain information required in connection with an issue of
assessment district bonds was not filed until approximately 124 days and 229 days, respectively, after the
date required for such filings. For Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016, the City’s annual report was not
properly associated on EMMA with the CUSIPs for certain general obligation bonds. The omissions have
been corrected; correcting EMMA filings have been made.

                                   DTC’S BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM


           The information in this Appendix F, concerning The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”),
and DTC’s book-entry system, has been furnished by DTC for use in official statements and the City takes no responsibility for
the completeness or accuracy thereof. The City cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect
Participants will distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of interest or principal with respect to the Certificates, (b)
certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation of ownership interest in the Certificates, or (c) redemption
or other notices sent to DTC or Cede & Co., its nominee, as the registered owner of the Certificates, or that they will so do on a
timely basis, or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Appendix
F. The current “Rules” applicable to DTC are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the current
“Procedures” of DTC to be followed in dealing with DTC Participants are on file with DTC. Information Furnished by DTC
Regarding its Book-Entry Only System

         1. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the
Certificates (as used in this Appendix E, the “Securities”). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Security certificate will be issued for each maturity of the
Securities, in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate
principal amount of any issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of
principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such
issue.

          2. DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the
New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of
the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial
Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate
and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s participants (“Direct
Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales
and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and
pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust &
Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation
and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of
its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S.
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC is rated
AA+ by Standard & Poor’s. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org.

          3. Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will
receive a credit for the Securities on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security
(“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners
will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive
written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the
Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership
interests in the Securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants
acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership
interests in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued.

                                                          Appendix F
                                                            Page 1
         4. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered
in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such
other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial
Owners of the Securities; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such
Securities are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will
remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

         5. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants
to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by
arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.
Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of
significant events with respect to the Securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to
the Security documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding
the Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit the notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative,
Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices
be provided directly to them.

        6. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Securities within an issue are being
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to
be redeemed.

         7. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the
Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its usual
procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the City as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy
assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Securities are
credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

          8. Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be made to Cede & Co.,
or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct
Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the City or the paying
agent or bond trustee, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records.
Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as
is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will
be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor its nominee, the paying agent or bond trustee, or the City,
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption
proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the City or the paying agent or bond trustee, disbursement
of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the
Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.

         9. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Securities at any time by
giving reasonable notice to the City or the paying agent or bond trustee. Under such circumstances, in the event that
a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered.

        10. The City may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a
successor securities depository). In that event, Security certificates will be printed and delivered to DTC.

         11. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from
sources that the City believes to be reliable, but the City takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

        Section 6. Identifying Information for Filings with EMMA. All documents provided to EMMA under this
Disclosure Certificate shall be accompanied by identifying information as prescribed by the MSRB.

Agent to assist it in carrying out its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate and may discharge any such agent,
with or without appointing a successor Dissemination Agent. If the Dissemination Agent is not the City, the
Dissemination Agent shall not be responsible in any manner for the content of any notice or report prepared by the
City pursuant to this Disclosure Certificate. It is understood and agreed that any information that the Dissemination
Agent may be instructed to file with EMMA shall be prepared and provided to it by the City. The Dissemination Agent
has undertaken no responsibility with respect to the content of any reports, notices or disclosures provided to it under
this Disclosure Certificate and has no liability to any person, including any Certificate owner, with respect to any such
reports, notices or disclosures. The fact that the Dissemination Agent or any affiliate thereof may have any fiduciary
or banking relationship with the City shall not be construed to mean that the Dissemination Agent has actual
knowledge of any event or condition, except as may be provided by written notice from the City.

          (b) Compensation of Dissemination Agent. The Dissemination Agent shall be paid reasonable compensation by
the City for its services provided hereunder in accordance with its schedule of fees as agreed to between the
Dissemination Agent and the City from time to time and all reasonable expenses, legal fees and expenses and advances
made or incurred by the Dissemination Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder. The Dissemination Agent
shall not be deemed to be acting in any fiduciary capacity for the City, owners or Beneficial Owners, or any other party.
The Dissemination Agent may rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting, upon any direction from
the City or an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel. The Dissemination Agent may at any time resign by
giving written notice of such resignation to the City. The Dissemination Agent shall not be liable hereunder except for
its negligence or willful misconduct.

         Section 9. Amendment; Waiver. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Disclosure Certificate, the City
may amend this Disclosure Certificate (and the Dissemination Agent shall agree to any amendment so requested by
the City that does not impose any greater duties or risk of liability on the Dissemination Agent), and any provision of
this Disclosure Certificate may be waived, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

         (a) Change in Circumstances. If the amendment or waiver relates to the provisions of Sections 3(a), 4 or 5(a)
or (b), it may only be made in connection with a change in circumstances that arises from a change in legal
requirements, change in law, or change in the identity, nature, or status of an obligated person with respect to the
Certificates, or the type of business conducted.




                                                       Appendix G
                                                         Page 4
         (b) Compliance as of Issue Date. The undertaking, as amended or taking into account such waiver, would, in
the opinion of a nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with the requirements of the Rule at the time of
the original issuance of the Certificates, after taking into account any amendments or interpretations of the Rule, as
well as any change in circumstances.

         (c) Consent of Holders; Non-impairment Opinion. The amendment or waiver either (i) is approved by the
Certificate owners in the same manner as provided in the Trust Agreement for amendments to the Trust Agreement
with the consent of Certificate owners, or (ii) does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, materially
impair the interests of the Certificate owners or Beneficial Owners.

         If this Disclosure Certificate is amended or any provision of this Disclosure Certificate is waived, the City
shall describe such amendment or waiver in the next following Annual Report and shall include, as applicable, a
narrative explanation of the reason for the amendment or waiver and its impact on the type (or in the case of a change
of accounting principles, on the presentation) of financial information or operating data being presented by the City.
In addition, if the amendment relates to the accounting principles to be followed in preparing financial statements, (i)
notice of such change shall be given in the same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5(c), and (ii) the Annual
Report for the year in which the change is made should present a comparison (in narrative form and also, if feasible, in
quantitative form) between the financial statements as prepared on the basis of the new accounting principles and
those prepared on the basis of the former accounting principles.

          Section 10. Additional Information. Nothing in this Disclosure Certificate shall be deemed to prevent the
City from disseminating any other information, using the means of dissemination set forth in this Disclosure Certificate
or any other means of communication, or including any other information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence
of a Listed Event, in addition to that which is required by this Disclosure Certificate. If the City chooses to include any
information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event in addition to that which is specifically
required by this Disclosure Certificate, the City shall have no obligation under this Disclosure Certificate to update
such information or include it in any future Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event.

         Section 11. Default. In the event of a failure of the City to comply with any provision of this Disclosure
Certificate, any Certificate owner or Beneficial Owner may take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate,
including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order, to cause the City to comply with its obligations
under this Disclosure Certificate. The sole remedy under this Disclosure Certificate in the event of any failure of the
City to comply with this Disclosure Certificate shall be an action to compel performance.

           Section 12. Duties, Immunities and Liabilities of Dissemination Agent. The Dissemination Agent shall
have only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Disclosure Certificate, and no implied covenants or obligations
shall be read into this Disclosure Certificate against the Dissemination Agent, and the City agrees to indemnify and
save the Dissemination Agent, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless against any loss, expense and
liabilities which it may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and duties hereunder,
including the reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) of defending against any claim
of liability, but excluding liabilities due to the Dissemination Agent’s negligence or willful misconduct. The
Dissemination Agent shall have the same rights, privileges and immunities hereunder as are afforded to the Trustee
under the Trust Agreement. The obligations of the City under this Section 12 shall survive resignation or removal of
the Dissemination Agent and payment of the Certificates.
