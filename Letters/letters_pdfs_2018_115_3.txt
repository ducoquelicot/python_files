Subject:                        Airplane Noise - Opportunity



City Council Members:

I urge you to add this item to the August 13 City Council Agenda.

At the current time Palo Alto has no official channel and therefore no voice with which to communicate with
the SFO or the FAA. Consequently, Palo Alto must be proactive and communicate its position on the new
flight path protocol to SFO at least a month before SFO submits its so-called "innovative approach requests" to
the FAA in December. Please don’t miss this first opportunity to influence a design that could reduce noise for
Palo Alto residents.


Thank you!

I used to work for Eastern Airlines out of Boston and airplane “noise” isn’t noise to me. I rather like looking up
to see beautiful planes flying overhead. Yet, I understand not everyone feels that way and, in any case, Palo
Alto should have a voice about aviation in the Bay Area.


"Palo Alto must be proactive and communicate its position on GBAS to SFO at least a month before SFO
submits their innovative approach requests to the FAA in December 2018. We hope that the City won’t miss
this first opportunity to be proactive in influencing a design that could reduce noise for many Palo Alto
residents, as well as, other residents in neighboring cities."

Dear council members,

From what I have read, this partnership between the City and Pets in Need would be a wonderful
arrangement, so I am writing to ask you all to please make this partnership official.
I especially like their no‐kill policy; and they have a proven track record, which is the kind of group we
obviously would want to connect with.
Please do this at your 13 August meeting. My pets have always been from shelters!

Subject:                              Palo Alto traffic


Greetings to All,

In reading an email from a council member late last week I was both surprised and disappointed in some of the comments made
by Mayor Kniss with regards to traffic in Palo Alto and in particular downtown. The only common viewpoint I can share with
the mayor is that "if they [residents] find traffic to be a problem they could email her". In doing so I am not going to be able to
make all points that need to be made, but this is a start of a conversation between those who believe that there is a problem,
a serious problem, with traffic and those who don’t.

Topic: Alma Street- downtown Palo Alto

Mayor Kniss’s comment at council meeting: "I think some our our reports of traffic are really exaggerated. The same with Alma
[street] I have not discovered this so if some of you have this experience recently … you know, send me an email or something
like that”.

My response to both of these comments:

Having lived and worked on Alma Street for close to twenty years I see the traffic problems differently from the mayor. The
mayor’s traffic comments are taken from the prospective of being part of the traffic, part of the problem in not seeing traffic but
driving in it. This is no way to make judgement on the proliferation of the massing of drivers attempting to get both into
downtown and out. The mayor’s comment of “And like you I drive a lot.” does not help if all the same people massing on Alma
Street have this same self attitude. This is what is making traffic congestion. So seeing traffic when one is 'in traffic' is not the
way to observe traffic and make comments of the experience.

The way to observe traffic problems is to be stationary from the traffic. I have for years observed the traffic on Alma Street thru
a nineteen foot tall living area window that looks both out and into the downtown area. From the deck you can see the
northbound traffic coming to a complete halt from a traffic light over a block away. This backup is five days a week, morning
and evening commutes, and has steadily grown to increase every year without any mitigation of traffic brainstorms, thus
becoming a non-solution.

What makes traffic congestion today different from the past years:

1. The increase of single car occupants commuting. The fabrication of these people getting out of their cars to take ‘alternative
transportation’ is unfounded on Alma Street.

2. The increase of commercial delivery services to the downtown businesses has grown to where most downtown streets are
littered with the delivery trucks almost all day long. Years ago the Ace Hardware store would take delivery of propane tanks for
sale maybe once or twice a week, today there is a six day delivery in place. And this is true for most businesses and services in
the downtown area. Food delivery takes place almost round the clock [Whole Foods] with every daily delivery a
'specialty service’. This is completely unregulated,unnecessary and a foolish service that did not exist until recent years. You
can run into tractor trailers on Alma Street which normally service warehouses outside the urban areas now delivering 'five
cases of Coke' on many of the side streets making havoc of the flow of traffic.

3. The increase of Construction traffic adds congestion and pollution on Alma Street as these drivers may be heading downtown
or be heading over to Menlo Park and Stanford construction sites. Construction sites don’t start until 7am but on Alma Street
they can be heard at 5:30am on making their way untethered by enforcement of traffic laws or transportation requirements of
hauling debris from construction sites. The commercial trucks with tandem haulers are on Alma Street for most of the day
driving in pods of four or six at a time. They drive without regard for laws or regulations. point this means the speed limit of 25
                                                                  1
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 8/9/2018 10:02 AM
mph on Alma Street not being close to their speeds. The tandem haulers are equipped with a cover to keep their debris load
from blowing out and down the local This was true for the trucks running on Alma Street over the past few days to remove the
debris from the two dealerships in Menlo Park that are currently being torn down. It is common knowledge that car service
businesses are notorious for toxins in their building materials. But here they come on Alma Street with their covers tucked
away. Their lack of concern noticed as they travel south untethered to the laws and regulations. Why does this need to persist?

Results: Alma Street has become a four lane Turnpike.

The only positive note from the mayor’s comments on traffic in the Palo Alto area is that this may start a traffic conversation
this city has not had with its informed residents.

With best regards,

Brian Anuskewicz

Dear Mayor Kniss and Members of the Palo Alto City Council,

My name is Lorraine Brown and I live in Palo Alto, California. I am writing to you as a long time resident of Palo Alto and
supporter of Castilleja School.

Castilleja was founded 110 years ago to equalize educational opportunities for women. Today, Castilleja seeks to close
the female leadership gap by gradually adding students over four years. Making this opportunity available for more
young women is central to furthering that mission.

As a Palo Alto resident, I am proud to have Castilleja in our city. The school has been an indispensable community
partner and is committed to maintaining its neighbors’ current quality of life. Castilleja has already implemented robust
Traffic Demand Management initiatives, and has repeatedly pledged to neighbors not only to do more, but that the
admittance of new students will be dependent on the continued success of the school’s traffic programs.

Now more than ever, at a time when national politics has devolved into shouting matches and one‐upmanship,
Castilleja’s mission of serving girls and young women from Palo Alto and other nearby cities is critically important.

Please do not let the loudest voices in the conversation obscure the robust support for Castilleja found throughout our
wonderful city.

Sincerely,

Lorraine Brown

Councilmember Liz Kniss and the Palo alto City Council

To say there is no traffic problem around University Avenue defies reality. If you do not live within the traffic
nightmare you do not understand that the choices of other exits or entrances from 101 are not available if you
can’t get out of your driveway. The neighbors who live around University Avenue are stuck. Trapped in their
homes.

       Palo Alto City Council Meeting July 30 2018
       Transcript of comments on traffic from Mayor Kniss
       TIME STAMP 2:58:30 – 2:59:50

       “OK I'm just going to make a couple of comments and one of them is
       about traffic.”

       “And, like most of you I drive a lot. And one of the things that I found
       really puzzling is about a month ago when I needed to leave town and
       get out on the freeway and I’ve heard how often University is jammed or
       Oregon may be jammed, there are other routes you can take. I happened
       to take Channing. I took it at 5 o’clock one day and it was about the
       same as if I had taken it at 1 o’clock in the afternoon.”

       “I think some of our reports of traffic are really exaggerated."


       "The same with Alma. I drive Alma…(addresses noise in the audience)..
       I have not discovered this so if some of you have this experience
       recently… you know, send me an email or something like that.”

       “But I think if you are willing to try alternate routes - not go your normal
       route - I think you’ll find that the traffic is not as overwhelming as you
       might think.
       We are here on the corner of Hamilton and Ramona and Forest as so
       forth. I seldom walk out and see any real traffic.”

Both Wagner and Bonilla are masters in deception and will make use of ALL of the about mentioned tactics of
coercion to entrap you, and place you in a crime you did not commit. As well documented in the now infamous
PAPD Jorge Hernandez case.....

Lessons learned? Never, never trust the police.....Especially this police chief! His truths of community
deception, coercion, and false statements...are slowly, but surely, being revealed....through popcorn and
lemonade stand propaganda... Masterfully done....diversion....

Compelling article Aram. Despite the decline in national unemployment numbers...BTW I was an analyst for the bureau

Unfortunately, if you look at the short tract record of Mr. Jonson’s, his priorities based on his tweets are:

1. Police Recruting
2. Lemonade stands
3. Popcorn machines

This chief is completely out of touch with the trenches of the Palo Alto community, namely the impoverished and
disenfranchised.

I agree that CTE and Alzheimer’s must be somehow related as they both involve the accumulation of
phosphorylated tau tangle aggregations in the brain. Exactly how the two diseases are related is still a mystery.

        I met a man last weekend who told me he had a son my age, named HS, who died recently, at

        year for university, had CTE and eventually suicided. I also went to high school, in 1981, with
        Krystin Wiggin, whose father coached at local Stanford University and she wrote an essay, in
        1981,about the suicide of her father's teammate and friend             . When did this start? When
        and where does it stop?

        Palo Alto also somewhat famously has a "suicide cluster" of young people perhaps stresed out by
        their job prospects or the fate of the planet. Besides HS, I am wondering if Palo Alto has a CTE
        cluster.

        And if we do, so might you.

       In my case, I played "flag football" at the local junior high. I was a guard on running plays and
       switched to flanker on pass plays. My mom would not let me play high school (tackle) football;
       she sent me to tennis camp instead of "double days". When George Seifert was a Stanford
       assistant (to Bill Walsh) he told my mom at a banquet that she did the right thing, but she said he
       said that I shouldn't play football unless I had a "killer instinct".

       (My mom, ironically, died last week of             at 87 -- a separate but related problem:
       when did             start? Where and when does it end?)

So glad you’re on board! Although I do think we need to wait for summer to be over for both PAUSD and
Stanford to get a true sample size of traffic before we call in the press.

In the mean time I’m happy to meet with you any time (except this Thursday as we are going to Les
Miserables in SF)- how about Friday Aug 10th? I’m also happy to have you over for tea on our front porch
and we can watch the cut through Lincoln traffic.

       I like your idea of gathering late afternoon in the area that is heavily affected by the traffic.
       I could be available this Thursday at 4:30 or the following Thursday at 4:30. In fact why don't we
       do
       This Thursday at 4:30 on August 9. and see what the turnout is and try again the following
       Thursday if we haven't given sufficient Publicity.
       We could notify the press, both the Weekly and the Post and I believe they would both be there.

                            it was advisable to send people through neighborhood
                            streets to avoid traffic? These streets are not
                            designed for commuting and are not safe for heavy
                            traffic- and Channing only gets you so far, it does not
                            connect to 101. I’m baffled by your comments as a 30
                            year resident of Palo Alto- unless you have been
                            looking for traffic and parking before 7:45 am and
                            after 8:00 pm. How could you possibly say there isn’t
                            congestion on all routes in and out of our town?
                            Sometimes there is true gridlock at University and
                            101. More times than I can count I have waited over
                            20 minutes to move 4 blocks between Crescent and
                            101. We live in Professorville and I just Wazed the
                            drive time to Ikea at 3:55 pm, 8/6/18 and it says 21
                            minutes for the fastest route (3.3 miles of driving) the
                            shortest route is 26 minutes (1.6 miles away). I
                            randomly picked Ikea because it is a major landmark
                            on the other side of 101. The Four Seasons is 1.4
                            miles from my house and is listed as 16-17 minutes
                            drive time with three different routes never crossing
                            101. Today is a slow summer Monday and I can walk
                            to both of these locations faster than I can drive.
                            Please let me know if you would ever like to drive with
                            me when I am taking and picking up my children from
                            their after school activities and you can show me
                            these faster routes you know of. As a mother with four
                            active children I could really use your expertise as I
                            am increasingly spending more and more time getting
                            from points A to B to C. Try making a left hand turn
                            from Alma to Churchill to El Camino at 5PM during
                            the school year.

                            Transcript of comments on traffic from Mayor
                            Kniss

                            Palo Alto City Council Meeting July 30 2018

                            TIME STAMP 2:58:30 – 2:59:50

                                    “OK I'm just going to make a couple
                                    of comments and one of them is
                                    about traffic.”

                                    “And, like most of you I drive a lot.
                                    And one of the things that I found
                                    really puzzling is about a month ago
                                    when I needed to leave town and get
                                    out on the freeway and I’ve heard
                                    how often University is jammed or
                                    Oregon may be jammed, there are
                                    other routes you can take. I happened
                                    to take Channing. I took it at 5
                                    o’clock one day and it was about the
                                    same as if I had taken it at 1
                                    o’clock in the afternoon.”

                                    “I think some of our reports of traffic
                                    are really exaggerated."

                                    "The same with Alma. I drive
                                    Alma…(addresses noise in the
                                    audience).. I have not discovered this
                                    so if some of you have this
                                    experience recently… you know,
                                    send me an email or something like
                                    that.”

                                    “But I think if you are willing to try
                                    alternate routes - not go your normal
                                    route - I think you’ll find that the
                                    traffic is not as overwhelming as you
                                    might think.

                                    We are here on the corner of
                                    Hamilton and Ramona and Forest as
                                    so forth. I seldom walk out and see
                                    any real traffic.”

Sorry for all the cell phone autocorrects. I would suggest doing the Press/Facebook live feed after Stanford
starts, which is September 24th so we are collecting average day commuters.

                      I like your idea of gathering late afternoon in the area that is
                      heavily affected by the traffic.
                      I could be available this Thursday at 4:30 or the following
                      Thursday at 4:30. In fact why don't we do
                      This Thursday at 4:30 on August 9. and see what the turnout is
                      and try again the following Thursday if we haven't given
                      sufficient Publicity.
                      We could notify the press, both the Weekly and the Post and I
                      believe they would both be there.
                      Let me know what you think. It's a terrific idea and will draw
                      attention to a very real problem.

Subject:                          SB 1186 And Police Transparency


Emerging technologies offer police departments the opportunity for better investigation tools, and even preemptive
tools to identify criminal activity before innocent people are victimized by criminals. But, loss of privacy can result
from the use of these new technologies. A general lack of police transparency involving personal data becomes all-
too-obvious after police misuse of our data is revealed.

Few disagree that greater police transparency is needed across the land. SB 1186, a bill addressing the need for
the adoption of policies dealing with police use of surveillance technologies, has been introduced by Sen. Jerry
Hill. This bill would seem to address the need for published policies by every police department in California
(including the Highway Patrol and Department of Justice) regarding police use of this new technology—thereby
increasing police transparency.

This bill rightly proposes that meetings where these policies are to be approved by each agency’s governing body
be publicly noticed, and all proposed policies posted on each agency’s website for public review and comment.

Unfortunately, SB 1186 imposes a tremendous burden on the state’s police organizations. To comply with this law,
it would pay for regional police departments to collaborate on the policies intended for the use of surveillance
technologies so that we residents are not subject to an unknowable hodgepodge of policies providing a legal
framework for use of this, and other new technologies.

Most people treasure their privacy. Our police need to recognize this fact in their policies and actions.

Hopefully, the Palo Alto City Council will support the passage of SB 1186 with a resolution to that effect.

Liz,
The traffic in Palo Alto is terrible -and stressful - it negatively impacts the quality of life. How is it that you do
not see it? I can not imagine it is anything other than wilful intent.
  Now the City will probably allow Casti to expand with over a hundred events each year and ridiculously
increased enrollment in the middle of a family residential district with all the additional traffic. What are you
thinking?
  We avoid going down University - so don't support any of those businesses. Why? Traffic and related
parking. Please take a real look around. Get stuck in the University traffic or the Embarcado traffic or
Middlefield traffic. Your view will change.
  The great qualities that brought my family to Palo Alto decades ago are slowly being eroded. Why support
such?

Dear Mayor Kniss,

While I was abroad, I was sent an excerpt of comments you made at a recent meeting of the Council regarding
traffic in Palo Alto.

I would like to believe that your comments were taken out of context, and that you are as concerned as I am
about the significant changes in vehicular traffic that have occurred in our city, changes that I think are directly
related to the boom in construction of commercial buildings.

My wife and I have lived in Palo Alto for 46 years and we are very concerned about the way the increase in
vehicular traffic has changed the quality of our lives. Every Palo Altan I have spoken to shares my concern
about traffic and about the seemingly uncontrolled growth of commercial buildings. Do you not share these
concerns?

I have voted for you in every election, City and County, so I would like clarification about where you stand
regarding the two issues I have raised: growth of commercial space and traffic.

 I know you are busy and that you may not be able to answer every email message you receive, but perhaps you
could refer me to printed material that express your views.

Sincerely.

Mahendra Ranchod

Subject:                       Traffic is a Problem in Palo Alto 080318o



Mayor Kniss,



Regarding your comments about traffic at the July 30th meeting, I wish to inform you that traffic in
Palo Alto IS a problem and is getting worse. Why? Three reasons:



   1. The “traffic calming” efforts by our misguided traffic “engineers” have narrowed many streets
       making traffic back up where it used to flow smoothly.

       2. Increased office space has brought more people into Palo Alto to work than when that space
       was used by retail businesses.

       3. Stop lights in school areas that operate as though school were in session 24/7. This
       requires cars to stop unnecessarily when there is no cross traffic and no children present. These
       traffic lights also increase air pollution by requiring cars to stop, idle, and then start up again
       when the light changes.

       It used to take me 5 to 6 minutes to go across Palo Alto on Charleston. It has recently taken me
       a half hour due to traffic. Cutting through neighborhoods becomes a necessity due to the traffic
       congestion.
