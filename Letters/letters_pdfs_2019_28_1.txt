       Dear Karen,

       I am afraid that I will be at work too late tonight to deliver this message in person so please forgive me
       for having to use email. I can’t thank you enough for your years of effort on behalf of the residents of
       Palo Alto. You are always up to date on the complexities of the issues that come before the Council. You
       never fail to ask searching questions regarding details that otherwise would have been ignored or
       glossed over. You have been stalwart in looking after the concerns of residents and have been
       indefatigable in that effort despite a Council that was frequently unsupportive of the direction you
       suggested.

       Thank you so much for your hard work on behalf of so many. It makes me so happy that you will be
       open space commissioner. I know you will be superb in that capacity.

       Best,

       Beth

Subject:             Council Reorganization


City Council Members,

Thank you to outgoing Mayor Kniss for your outstanding leadership of the city council last year. While Palo Alto still has
a long way to go in addressing our housing shortage, significant progress was made this year to enable more production
of much needed multifamily housing supply. In 2019, I hope that the city council will continue to address the housing
crisis and prevent homelessness by enacting policies to produce housing for all income levels, preserve existing
multifamily, and protect tenants.

The local newspapers reported that Eric Filseth is likely to be selected as mayor. While I believe that Councilmember
Filseth has demonstrated willingness to compromise and responsiveness to evidence (e.g., recognition that parking
pricing impacts transportation decisions) as Vice Mayor, his attitudes toward housing production suggest he does not
appreciate the urgency and severity of our housing crisis (e.g., "People who live in Palo Alto can afford to live in Palo
Alto"‐‐This statement is accurate for homeowners, but not renters, nearly 40% of whom are overburdened by housing
costs in Palo Alto). I would prefer a mayor who recognizes that increasing overall supply of housing (including subsidized
and market‐rate housing) benefits renters and the health of our community as a whole.

I enthusiastically support Adrian Fine for Mayor. I am confident that Councilmember Fine, a renter himself, understands
Palo Alto's housing needs. His leadership is of particular importance this year given that the Planning and Transportation
Commission now has no renter representation. Furthermore, Councilmember Fine's background in planning makes him
uniquely qualified to lead the council in addressing our most pressing housing and transportation problems.

For Vice Mayor, I believe Allison Cormack would likely be an excellent choice. Although I am unsure whether she would
agree with all aspects of my housing agenda, she has shown a willingness to listen which suggests she would be skilled a
facilitating productive discussion and building consensus.

Finally, I would also like to thank the outgoing city council members Scharff, Holman, and Wolbach. Thank you for your
generous service to the city!

Subject:              01-09-19 UAC meeting, Item IX.2 -- fiber optics, wireless, and AMI


Commissioners,

At UAC's 01-09-19 meeting (agenda here)
https://cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/68326
Item IX.2 will be about fiber optics, wireless, and AMI infrastructure. It's a "discussion" item, so UAC can't vote.

Here's the staff report.
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/68314

Please see my comments about the staff report, below the "######" line (paragraphs beginning with "###").

SUMMARY:

* I think it would be a mistake to "sunset" CAC. There's no reason CAC and UAC can't play complementary roles.

* I sense "mission creep" away from FTTP as an ultimate goal and toward humoring the incumbents. If so, that would be
unfortunate.

Thanks.

STAFF REPORT

https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/68314

MEMORANDUM TO: UTILITIES ADVISORY COMMISSION
FROM: UTILITIES DEPARTMENT
DATE: January 9, 2019
SUBJECT: Staff Request for Feedback on Recommendations Regarding the City’s Fiber-Optic, Wireless and Advanced
Meter Infrastructure Planning

### UAC's job is advising Council, not staff.
______________________________________________________________________________

Request

Request for feedback from the Utilities Advisory Commission regarding the following two staff recommendations regarding
fiber-optic, wireless and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) planning:


                                                               1
1. Staff is considering reissuing the Fiber-to-the-Node (FTTN) Request for Proposal to expedite network planning, design
and construction and to better align the FTTN network business case with the AMI implementation plan. Additional tasks
will include a detailed design and construction cost estimate to build the network.

2. Have the Utilities Advisory Commission (UAC) assume the advisory role to provide guidance and alignment for the AMI
implementation plan with fiber and wireless expansion initiatives,

### As you know, I have long advocated that UAC exercise its responsibility, spelled out in the City's municipal code,
Section 2.23.050 (purposes and duties),
http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/California/paloalto_ca/paloaltomunicipalcode?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$v
id=amlegal:paloalto_ca
to advise Council about the City's utilities, including (as of 10-18-10)
https://cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/25435
the fiber utility. The municipal code does not spell out a responsibility to advise Council about wireless per se, but I guess
UAC is responsible to advise Council about wireless to the extent that it affects the City's utilities enumerated in Section
2.23.050. Of course, if there were a reason to add wireless per se to UAC's duties, Council could amend the municipal
code. Or Council could add the responsibility on an ad hoc basis, per Section 2.23.050(b)(5). (Sometime around 1998,
Council actually did add FTTP to UAC's list of responsibilities on an ad hoc basis. Sorry I can't be more specific. Online
records don't go back that far. But then Council removed that ad hoc responsibility in 2004.)

and sunset the Fiber and Wireless Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC), effective January 17, 2019.

### I was both surprised and disappointed by this proposal. Council's Technology and the Connected City
(TACC) committee directed City Manager Keene to appoint a Citizen Advisory Committee at its 05-14-13 meeting (Item 5,
page 6).
https://cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/35046
Who now has the authority to "sunset" it?

### Incidentally, when CAC was created, I think that did not absolve UAC of any of its responsibilities. And, as far as I
can see, Section 2.23.050 does not provide a mechanism for Council to subtract from UAC's responsibilities on an ad hoc
basis.

Background

On August 21, 2017, Council directed staff to: (1) Pursue a Fiber-to-the Node (FTTN) network for fiber and broadband
expansion; and (2) Expand Wi-Fi to unserved City facilities and discontinue consideration of City-provided Wi-Fi in
commercial areas - Staff Report ID #7616: https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/61084) .

The Council Motion directed staff to:

A. Develop a business case

### Does this mean that if FTTN can't at least pay for itself without considering future FTTP possibilities, then we
shouldn't do even FTTN?

### I don't like the idea of FTTN. But CTC (our consultant) persuaded the Boulder City Council to do a $15 million FTTN
(which they call a fiber optic backbone) as a step toward municipal FTTP, using certificates of participation for
financing. Council understood very well that their FTTN wouldn't begin to pay for itself on its own. But it's a step toward
municipal FTTP, which they knew they wanted.
https://bouldercolorado.gov/connect-boulder/boulder-broadband-enhancement
For the curious, there's a video of the 05-08-18 Council meeting (3:04:14).
https://boulder.novusagenda.com/agendapublic/VODPreview.aspx?meetingVideoID=f58b1a2f-4307-4d2f-acdc-

for a municipal-provided Fiber-to-the-Node (FTTN) network for fiber and broadband expansion ("Option 2"); engage a
management consultant to develop the business case, funding plans, identify potential partners and/or service providers,
and high level

network design; and engage an engineering firm to design a FTTN network including an expansion option to build a
citywide Fiber-to- the-Premises (FTTP) network; and

B. Expand Wi-Fi to unserved City facilities and discontinue consideration of City provided Wi-Fi in commercial areas; and

C. Expediently return to Council with Ordinances that will lower the City’s FTTN construction costs such as a Dig Once,
String Once Ordinance; a Multi-unit housing Ordinance; and a Microtrenching Ordinance.

### I wonder whether Council understood that "expedient" means "suitable for bringing about a desired result under the
circumstances."
https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/expedient
It doesn't mean quickly. It leaves unexplained who's desiring what result, and why "the circumstances" might excuse a
less than ideal result.

### Maybe Council meant expeditiously -- "with speed and great efficiency."
https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/expeditiously

### In the past, a member of the City Attorney's office has attended UAC meetings, just in case it would be convenient
for UAC to get legal advice. As I understand it, the four ordinances are hung up in the City Attorney's office for some
reason. If a member of the City Attorney's office were to attend UAC's 01-09-19 meeting, would UAC be willing
to ask that person what the hang-up is?

On November 19, 2018, the Council approved the City of Palo Alto Utilities Smart Grid Assessment and Technology
Implementation plan, including advanced metering infrastructure-based smart grid systems to serve electricity, water and
natural gas utility customers - Staff Report ID #9780:
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/67639)

AMI is a foundational technology that is becoming a standard in the utilities industry and will improve customer experience
while enabling City of Palo Alto Utilities to operate more efficiently.

### AMI is going to make the rates for electricity, gas, and water go up. Period. But it MIGHT also provide the
information customers need to conserve enough that their bills don't also go up. When Council considered the issue, it
was late, and there was very little discussion, so I wonder how many Council members understood this.

The Council encouraged staff to align the FTTN business case and leverage the dark fiber network with the AMI
deployment.

### At Council's 11-19-18 meeting, Council Member DuBois said (at 3:00:37 on this transcript of the video, page 62)
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/67916
"We should evaluate whether we can leverage our dark fiber optic backbone." I think he was trying to say we should
develop fiber assets that can be useful for both AMI and FTTP. And staff was saying, in effect, that AMI needs no fiber
assets.

Discussion In response to the Council’s August 21, 2017 motion, staff completed the following actions:

1. A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued on June 28, 2018, to retain a management consultant for professional
services to develop a business case to build a FTTN network to multiple neighborhood nodes, assess local market
conditions, identify potential public-private partnerships, and develop City ordinances that could lower fiber construction
costs and incentivize fiber development. The RFP noted that depending on the outcome of the above-mentioned tasks,
the City may issue another RFP to engage an engineering firm to prepare a detailed design and cost estimate for a FTTN
network, including an expansion option to deploy a citywide FTTP network.

### To me, this expansion option to deploy a citywide FTTP network is the raison d'être of FTTN. So I was disappointed
that it was considered only as an "option."

The RFP scope of work included all the above-noted items in parts A and C of the Council Motion.

2. The City’s OverAir Wi-Fi hotspots were expanded to the following unserved City facilities: Lucie Stern Children’s
outdoor theater, Lucie Stern courtyard, Baylands Golf Course Café and Pro Shop, and within all rooms across the
Cubberley Community Center campus. Considering the Council’s acceptance of the smart grid and technology plan, it is
recommended that the fiber-optic network expansion planning employ a fundamental design principle of fully leveraging
                                                             3
and expanding this network to support a communications platform for AMI, Smart City initiatives and wireless technologies
to support City services.

### I question this "fundamental design principle," since it doesn't include supporting FTTP, and it does include support
for "Smart City initiatives and wireless technologies to support City services" that haven't been described yet.

### One of the definitions of "fundamental" is "adhering to fundamentalism,"
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fundamental
which is not what you want in City government.

As a result, and in response to Council’s November 19, 2018 motion, staff is assessing whether to revise some of the
tasks requested in the original FTTN RFP to better align the business case with the AMI network, including potentially
adding the detailed design and cost estimate for a Citywide FTTN network to the project scope and reissuing the original
RFP, with the tasks shown below:

--- page 3 ---

• Task 1 – Develop a business case and identify potential applications for FTTN, including a financial model for each
alternative network and a high-level scalable design to support essential City services, including AMI.

### Again, I think it's unreasonable to expect FTTN to pay for itself without considering future FTTP possibilities.

• Task 2 – Identify potential private-public partnership models to attract partners to deploy next generation broadband
services for the community.

### What's the difference between a "private-public partnership" and a "public-private partnership"? Google gets
7,680,000 hits for "public-private partnership" but only 643,000 his for "private-public partnership." Searching only the
City's website, Google gets 887 hits for "public-private partnership" but only 122 for "private-public partnership."

### Fort Collins, CO, and Loveland, CO, both looked into public-private partnerships (PPPs), and both concluded that a
FTTP PPP was less desirable for them than a municipal retail FTTP model.

• Task 3 – Draft City ordinances for Council consideration to lower fiber construction costs to incentivize third parties to
build and operate a new network. Example ordinances include Dig Once, Microtrenching, String Once (a.k.a. One Touch
Make Ready), and Multi-unit housing access.

### This item seems to say that the only reason to do the ordinances is for the sake of third parties. Is that what Council
meant?

• Additional Task 4 – Dependent on the outcome of the business case, prepare a detailed design and construction cost
estimate for a FTTN network.

### This summary fails to say anything about the expansion option to deploy a citywide FTTP network. So I don't like it
for that reason.

Staff has worked constructively with the Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) since its appointment by the City Manager in
2014.

### Council's Technology and the Connected City committee asked City Manager Keene to appoint a CAC on 05-14-13
(See the minutes, Item 5, page 6.)
https://cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/35046
It took him until 02-18-14 to appoint the members, which happened to be the day before Google publicly announced its
intentions to consider deploying Google Fiber to 34 more cities, including Palo Alto.

Notable accomplishments of the CAC include working with staff and a consultant to prepare the 2015 Fiber-to-the-
Premises Master Plan and Wireless Network Plan, preparing a Request for Information (RFI) in 2016 for a public-private
partnership to build a citywide FTTP network,

### I don't remember how many bids were received. Staff asked the bidders who would be willing to have their bids
(perhaps with sensitive portions censored) revealed to the public, and eight were willing to allow that.
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/utl/news/rfi_responses.asp
                                                              4
Six bids were deemed "compliant." Staff thought three bids were worthy of further consideration.
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/55016
Ultimately, none was deemed good enough. Why does staff persist in thinking that a PPP might still be a good idea?

providing input for the 2018 FTTN RFP, in addition to providing assistance related to Google Fiber. The Committee’s
valuable guidance has been much appreciated. At this time, given Council’s direction to prepare a FTTN network
business case and approval of the AMI implementation plan, staff recommends the UAC assume the primary role in
aligning AMI with the fiber and wireless expansion initiatives, and to provide recommendations to the Council.

### As far as I'm concerned, UAC has always (since 1990) had the role of advising Council about utilities, including
(since 10-18-10) the fiber utility.

### CAC has had the role of advising staff, which is a different thing. Staff is apparently saying it no longer needs any
advice from CAC.

The UAC is well suited to assume this role, which is in line with its purpose and duty to advise Council on major programs
and projects related to the City’s utilities, including the fiber optics utility. The UAC can also provide a broad forum for
wider community participation, outreach and oversight for fiber, wireless and AMI planning.

### Yes. UAC meetings are videotaped, so the public can find out exactly who said what. And agendas with staff
reports are posted in advance, so the public can know in advance what's going to be discussed. And, in theory at least,
UAC has some sort of say about what gets agendized. And, for the action items at least, UAC can vote, as a way of
advising Council. In the old days, before June 2004, the posted minutes were verbatim, so the public could read
exactly who said what. I'd like to see verbatim minutes reinstated.

### Initially, CAC meetings were not open to the public, and agendas were not posted in advance. After a time, that
changed. But on one occasion, CAC did again meet behind closed doors to hear CTC explain how it did its FTTP cost
estimates. (CTC considered this information to be proprietary, so it didn't want to do the explaining in public.) CAC
meetings are not videotaped. CAC usually met approximately every other month, but in 2018, CAC met only twice. Staff
cancelled meetings five times.
https://cityofpaloalto.org/gov/boards/technology_committee.asp

The UAC will effectively facilitate recommendations to the Council and create the best opportunity to efficiently leverage
the City’s fiber network with the AMI implementation to expedite network planning, design and construction. Resource
Impact Depending on feedback from the UAC, staff will recommend to Council an award of a professional services
contract to retain a consultant to perform the tasks above, and will return to Council for approval.

### Apparently staff has decided not to recommend any of the existing bids to Council. OK. Would staff be willing to ask
the bidders who would be willing to have their bids (perhaps with sensitive portions censored) revealed to the public (as
was done for the 2016 RFI)?

### Is staff open to the possibility of receiving advice about the next RFP before it's issued? Does UAC think they should
be?

Policy Implications The fiber and wireless activities are consistent with the Telecommunications Policy adopted by the
Council in 1997, to facilitate advanced telecommunications services in Palo Alto in an environmentally sound manner
(Reference CMR: 369:97- Proposed Telecommunications Policy Statements).

### I recommend that Council review and update this policy, and direct staff to make the policy available online to the
public in an "official" place. A lot has changed in 21 years. Meanwhile, an unofficial version of the policy exists here
(pages 14-20).

Subject:          An idea to alleviate local traffic congestion



Dear Council,

Happy New Year!

I'm Fred Xia, a midtown resident. I'd like to share with you an idea about alleviating heavy
traffic congestion on our local streets.

We all know heavy traffic is caused by the large number of people working in Palo Alto but living
somewhere else. However another important factor is that major job centers, e.g. Downtown
and Stanford, are far away from highway exits. A friend of mine who lives in East Bay and
worked in Downtown Palo Alto once told me he often spent 40 minutes in evening rush hours
just to get on to Dumbarton Bridge from Downtown. It was very stressful for him as well.

My idea is to implement a Park and Ride system, together with Menlo Park, using self-driving
shuttles operated by Waymo and/or other high-tech companies, initially with two parking lots,
one right off Dumbarton Bridge and one at the 280/Page Mill exit.

I think this is going to be a win-win-win solution for Palo Alto, for commuters, and for the high-
tech companies:

      The capital cost is very low. There is already a Park and Ride lot at 280/Page Mill exit, and
       plenty of empty space adjacent to it. There is also large open space right off Dumbarton.
       Palo Alto and Menlo Park just need to pave the land to make space for commuter parking.
       The city government won't operate the service. Waymo or other self-driving car service
       companies will operate the service.

      While this is not a silver bullet solution, it will meaningfully reduce traffic on local streets.
       Google traffic map clearly shows that large number of commuters exit at Dumbarton and
       280/Page Mill in rush hours. I believe lot of them work in Stanford/Shopping
       Center/Hospital and Downtowns of Palo Alto and Menlo Park.

      It provides an ideal pilot program for self-driving car industry, and hence should be very
       attractive to companies like Waymo. Self-driving technology is still in its infancy. Shuttle
       routes on local streets have repeatable and limited scope, and yet very useful to the
       public. With mobile apps Waymo can easily interact with customers to optimize the
       scheduling and dispatching of shuttle vans. A customer will have good visibility on shuttle
       arrival and a satisfactory user experience.

      For commuters the benefit of convenience and comfort is significant. Instead of endlessly
       focusing on tail lights and hitting brakes and gas pedals he or she can relax, watching a
       movie or chatting with fellow commuters. There is simply no comparison in terms of
       quality of time.


                                                           1
      The system is very flexible. A commuter may choose to not use shuttle for the day and
       drive all the way to office for whatever reason. Conversely a commuter can also reach the
       parking lot using alternative methods such as Uber. This gives commuters peace of mind.

      Why not the other end of Dumbarton in Frement? Because of liability. It is still far way
       from enough confidence to commercially operate self-driving vehicles on critical highways,
       because the impact of an accident is too difficult to handle, both for technology and for
       public image.

      Self-driving car companies will be interested in subsidizing the trip cost, because it is the
       Killer App for them. It can very well become the first commercially viable application for
       self-driving technology. As such the program will also significantly boost the image of Palo
       Alto and Menlo Park as the center for technology innovation.

Palo Alto and Menlo Park are uniquely qualified for such Park and Ride + Self-Driving system
because these two cities have concentrated ingress/egress commute exit points, and open space
available adjacent to these points for parking lots. Other cities either have too diverse points of
entry or no land available for large parking lots. What Palo Alto and Menlo Park need to do is to
provide parking infrastructure and permits for Waymo and others to commercially operate self-
driving shuttles.

Thanks very much for reading.

U.S. Water Fluoridation: A Forced Experiment that Needs to
End
By the Children’s Health Defense Team
from childrenshealthdefense.org . January 9, 2019

   The United States stands almost entirely alone among developed nations in adding industrial silicofluorides to its
drinking water—imposing the community-wide measure without informed consent. Globally, roughly 5% of the population
consumes chemically fluoridated water, but more people in the U.S. drink fluoride-adulterated water than in all other
countries combined.
   Within the U.S., just under a third (30%) of local water supplies are not fluoridated; these municipalities have either held
the practice at baysince fluoridation’s inception or have won hard-fought battles to halt water fluoridation.
   Dozens of studies and reviews—including in top-tier journals such as The Lancet—have shown that fluoride is
neurotoxic and lowers children’s IQ.
The fluoride chemicals added to drinking water are unprocessed toxic waste products—captured pollutants from Florida’s
phosphate fertilizer industry or unregulated chemical imports from China.
   The chemicals undergo no purification before being dumped into drinking water and often harbor significant levels of
arsenic and other heavy metal contamination; one researcher describes this unavoidable contamination as a “regulatory
blind spot that jeopardizes any safe use of fluoride additives.”

   Dozens of studies and reviews—including in top-tier journals such as The Lancet—have shown that fluoride
is neurotoxic and lowers children’s IQ. Fluoride is also associated with a variety of other health risks in both children
and adults. However, U.S. officialdom persists in making hollow claims that water fluoridation is safe and beneficial,
choosing to ignore even its own research!
   A multimillion-dollar longitudinal study published in Environmental Health Perspectives in September, 2017, for
example, was largely funded by the National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences—and the seminal study revealed a strong relationship between fluoride exposure in pregnant women and
lowered cognitive function in offspring. Considered in the context of other research, the study’s implications are,
according to the nonprofit Fluoride Action Network, “enormous”—“a cannon shot across the bow of the 80 year old
practice of artificial fluoridation.”
   According to declassified government documents summarized by Project Censored, Manhattan Project scientists
discovered early on that fluoride was a leading health hazard to bomb program workers and surrounding communities.

A little history
  During World War II, fluoride (a compound formed from the chemical element fluorine) came into large-scale production
and use as part of the Manhattan Project. According to declassified government documents summarized by Project
                                                               1
Censored, Manhattan Project scientists discovered early on that fluoride was a “leading health hazard to bomb program
workers and surrounding communities.” In order to stave off lawsuits, government scientists “embarked on a campaign to
calm the social panic about fluoride…by promoting its usefulness in preventing tooth decay.”
   To prop up its “exaggerated claims of reduction in tooth decay,” government researchers began carrying out a series of
poorly designed and fatally flawed community trials of water fluoridation in a handful of U.S. cities in the mid-1940s. In
a critique decades later, a University of California-Davis statistician characterized these early agenda-driven fluoridation
trials as “especially rich in fallacies, improper design, invalid use of statistical methods, omissions of contrary data, and
just plain muddleheadedness and hebetude.”
   As one example, a 15-year trial launched in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1945 used a nearby city as a non-fluoridated
control, but after the control city began fluoridating its own water supply five years into the study, the design switched from
a comparison with the non-fluoridated community to a before-and-after assessment of Grand Rapids. Fluoridation’s
proponents admitted that this change substantially “compromised” the quality of the study.
   n 1950, well before any of the community trials could reach any conclusions about the systemic health effects of long-
term fluoride ingestion, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) endorsed water fluoridation as official public health policy,
strongly encouraging communities across the country to adopt the unproven measure for dental caries
prevention. Describing this astonishingly non-evidence-based step as “the Great Fluoridation Gamble,” the authors of the
2010 book, The Case Against Fluoride, argue that:
> “Not only was safety not demonstrated in anything approaching a comprehensive and scientific study, but also
a large number of studies implicating fluoride’s impact on both the bones and the thyroid gland were ignored or
downplayed” (p. 86).
   In 2015, Newsweek magazine not only agreed that the scientific rationale for putting fluoride in drinking water was not
as “clear-cut”as once thought but also shared the “shocking” finding of a more recent Cochrane Collaboration review,
namely, that there is no evidence to support the use of fluoride in drinking water.
Bad science and powerful politics
   The authors of The Case Against Fluoride persuasively argue that “bad science” and “powerful politics” are primary
factors explaining why government agencies continue to defend the indefensible practice of water fluoridation, despite
abundant evidence that it is unsafe both developmentally and after “a lifetime of exposure to uncontrolled doses.”
Comparable to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s book, Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak, which summarizes studies that the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and “credulous journalists swear don’t exist,” The Case Against
Fluoride is an extensively referenced tour de force, pulling together hundreds of studies showing evidence of fluoride-
related harm.
   … death rates in the ten most fluoridated U.S. states are 5% to 26% higher than in the ten least fluoridated
states, with triple the rate of Alzheimer’s disease.
   The research assembled by the book’s authors includes studies on fluoride biochemistry; cancer; fluoride’s
effects on the brain, endocrine system and bones; and dental fluorosis. With regard to the latter, public health
agencies like to define dental fluorosis as a purely cosmetic issue involving “changes in the appearance of tooth enamel,”
but the International Academy of Oral Medicine & Toxicology (IAOMT)—a global network of dentists, health professionals
and scientists dedicated to science-based biological dentistry—describes the damaged enamel and mottled and brittle
teeth that characterize dental fluorosis as “the first visible sign of fluoride toxicity.”
   The important 2017 study that showed decrements in IQ following fluoride exposure during pregnancy is far from the
only research sounding the alarm about fluoride’s adverse developmental effects. In his 2017 volume, Pregnancy and
Fluoride Do Not Mix, John D. MacArthur pulls together hundreds of studies linking fluoride to premature birth and
impaired neurological development (93 studies), preelampsia (77 studies) and autism (110 studies). The book points out
that rates of premature birth are “unusually high” in the United States.
    At the other end of the lifespan, MacArthur observes that death rates in the ten most fluoridated U.S. states are 5%
to 26% higher than in the ten least fluoridated states, with triple the rate of Alzheimer’s disease. A 2006 report by
the National Research Council warned that exposure to fluoride might increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s.

The word is out
   Pregnancy and Fluoride Do Not Mix shows that the Institute of Medicine, National Research Council, Harvard’s
National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Toxicology
Program all are well aware of the substantial evidence of fluoride’s developmental neurotoxicity, yet no action has been
taken to warn pregnant women.
   Instead, scientists with integrity, legal professionals and the public increasingly are taking matters into their own hands.
A Citizens Petition submitted in 2016 to the EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act requested that the EPA
“exercise its authority to prohibit the purposeful addition of fluoridation chemicals to U.S. water supplies.” This
request—the focus of a lawsuit to be argued in court later in 2019—poses a landmark challenge to the dangerous practice
of water fluoridation and has the potential to end one of the most significant chemical assaults on our children’s
developing bodies and brains.

will be hired to draft, advise or otherwise assist the City of Palo Alto with the ordinance amending
Section 18.42.110 (Wireless Communications Facilities) of the Municipal Code.

This is the amended ordinance that on December 12, 2018 you recommended to the Planning &
Transportation Commission that it in turn advise City Council to adopt.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Jeanne Fleming

30th 1994 in the Fred Hutchinson Center from complications after a bone marrow transplant while receiving treatment
of a pre‐leukemia condition. Hiding Heritage is always wrong.

That said, my Second Adoptive Family did manage to literally save me from an Irish Leary Mafia Family that induced their
own children, my cousins, to join the Irish Mafia when they were only Children. In addition Jon Leary aka Ron Tomczak
was raising Marisa in San Marcos aka Camila Cabello and her brother Fabian Gomez in San Marcos circa 1996 and today
Camila is offering Product Placement for Heroin usage in her song @“Never Be The Same” which you can verify in her
Official Music Video (as the lyrics are scrubbed in the version available online for reading, perhaps to leave parents less
fully informed.) Jon/Ron and Hannah/Jane have a Horse Ranch in El Cajon for At‐Risk Kids. That’s no joke. Every kid in
their care is literally at risk.




Here we have Max Travis Leary the cousin to Lauren Powell Jobs. The mother of Travis was of Greek Descendant and
married into the Leary Family by marrying Micheal Leary, the brother of Jon Leary. Max Travis Leary is today a
Registered Sex Offender whose sister died in July 1980. The odd thing here is that the victim was three years old while
his sister’s name was Tricia, and his Sex Offender Registration Address is Patricia Lane which is the more formal version
of the name Tricia. Today, despite his Registration Sex Offender Status in Illinois, Max had been working as a Greek
Priest for Twelve Years at the Greek Orthodox Church on 13th Avenue in Seattle under the alias of Father Dean.

Now can anyone tell me why the Identity of Erin Sienna Jobs who is likely a Cousin Once Removed from me, though
maybe only a Half Cousin, is being redacted with another face in the public eye? These are pictures of Erin Sienna Jobs.

Honorable Council Members:

Perhaps in the future funds might be used to create a more nurturing, compassionate society in Palo
Alto. Many live with challenges.

For example, during the severe air alert related to recent fires, a clean air area might have been
easily established. Five thousand dollars might have offered residents a place of caring and provided
healthy snacks and drinks for three worst days.

Monies will continue to be needed to support citizens as global warming increases.

You are in a position to take us further along on a journey to create better world.

Subject:             Planning Manager should Not have sole autority




Dear City Council Members,

I understand the city staff has a proposal to give the Planning Manager sole authority over the aesthetic standards for
cell towers ‐ including where they sit and their appearance.

While I understand the desire to streamline (both the city council as well as some of the city processes), we citizens
actually feel like we have a right to be involved and be able to express our opinions.

Given that some residents helped to uncover financial bias in at least one city staff member which directly impacted a
cell tower decision, you all might agree that residents contribute to the process.

I urge you to request modification of the proposed ordinance:

1) Have the Architectural Review Board lead in developing new standards; do not allow the Planning Manager sole
authority.

 2) Allow for a democratic process (residents input).

 3) Insist upon City Council's approval.

I sincerely thank you,
Ann Protter

Dear City Council and City Manager,

Planning director Lait is asking Castilleja School to verify their enrollment with a simple audit.
Castilleja has refused.



Castilleja is still in violation of their CUP, which restricts enrollment to 415 students. Given their
history of lying about enrollment, Castilleja should have to submit an audit of their enrollment before
any consideration can be given to their proposed expansion. Their financial records are audited every
year. An enrollment number would be easy to obtain without compromising anyone's privacy.



Please show citizens that you are willing to enforce the codes you have established. Castilleja has
had a very cozy relationship with City Hall for decades and it's time to subject them to the same laws
everyone else must abide by.



Thank you,

Jim Poppy

Jonathan Lait, Interim Planning Director (cc’ed) is a good person to contact regarding this ordinance. When this item
makes it onto a City Council agenda, it will be clearly identified as Action or Consent. Members of the public are
welcome to speak on either type of agenda item.

Regarding the appeals of Crown Castle/Verizon Cluster 2 and Vinculums/Verizon Cluster 2 agenda items, Rebecca
Atkinson, Planner (cc’ed) is a good person to contact.

Ms. Fleming,

The Tentative Agenda is a list of potential items for future Council meetings. The list is used to help balance the various
agenda items needing consideration by the City Council and is subject to change depending on work load, council
priorities, emerging concerns, etc.

City Council agendas are typically published 11 days prior to each Council meeting, and include the topics Council will
consider at the respective meeting. The Agenda for the January 14 City Council meeting will be published on January 10,
later than normal due to winter holidays. The Agenda for the January 22 City Council meeting will also be published on
January 10.

The Tentative Agenda published yesterday does not list either a wireless ordinance nor any appeals for small cell
applications through January 28, however, as a tentative list, it does not constitute the final set of agenda items the
Council may consider at the January meetings.

Dear David Carnahan,

Thank you for your prompt response.

To be sure I understand you, please tell me if this is correct: The amended Wireless Ordinance City
Staff is recommending that City Council approve—and approve before January 14, 2019—is not in
City Council’s schedule for consideration.

Also to be sure I understand you, I would appreciate it if you would tell me if this is correct: The
tentative agenda published on December 12, 2018 which said that appeals of Crown Castle/Verizon
Cluster 2 and Vinculums/Verizon Cluster 2 would be heard by City Council on January 22nd, 2019
was not correct, and no such appeals are scheduled to be heard on that date, nor have they been set
for any other date.

Thank you again,

Happy New Year Ms. Fleming,

The City Council Tentative Agenda is updated each week a Council Packet is published and includes a tentative list of
items for future Council meetings. The Tentative Agenda published today goes out through the January 28 Council
meeting. Neither of the items you mention are currently on the Tentative Agenda through January 28.

Please keep in mind that the tentative items listed for any particular City Council Agenda are subject to change. City
Council Agendas are typically published 11 days in advance of each meeting.

If you have not already signed up for the City Council Agenda Email List, I recommend signing up to receive notification
when a new agenda is published. You can find the Tentative Agenda listed on the last page of the City Council Agenda.

Subject: Council consideration of amendments to Wireless Ordinance and cell tower appeals

Dear David Carnahan,

I would appreciate it if you would tell me when City Council is scheduled to consider the proposed
amendments to the Wireless Ordinance (18.42.110).

I would also appreciate it if you would tell me whether appeals of Crown Castle/Verizon Cluster 2 and
Vinculums/Verizon Cluster 2 remain on City Council’s schedule for January 22nd, 2019.

If you are not the right person to ask for this information, please let me know who I should contact.

Thank you, as always, for your help, and Happy New Year to you.

Subject:             re: Wireless Ordinance amendment


Hi ‐

  I am writing you all in the City Council strongly requesting you do not approve an amendment to the Wireless
Ordinance *unless it is modified*:

‐ To make the ARB (Architectural Review Board) the lead in developing new standards ‐ NOT the Planning Director.

‐ To provide Palo Alto residents opportunities to respond to the proposed standards ‐ thereby making the process more
democratic.

As a resident of Palo Alto I know that by doing what I suggest will help not only the overall aesthetics of wireless
installations in our neighborhoods, but also create a reassuring environment that the city council takes into
consideration the voices of its citizens on proposals that impact them and their homes.

Regards,

‐Phil Coulson

Subject:             Recently Rewritten Proposal for Palo Alto Wireless Ordinance Amendment


Dear Ms. Cormack, Ms. Kou, Mr. Tanaka, Mr. Filseth, Mr. Fine, and Ms. Kniss,

Please do not approve the newly rewritten proposal for the Palo Alto Wireless Ordinance.

You cannot in good conscience allow one Planning Commissioner to have sole discretion over the aesthetics and
placement of cell towers in Palo Alto without being accountable to Palo Alto voters and/or being professionally qualified
to make such decisions.

For months, your constituents, the residents of Palo Alto, have attended hours of meetings and written many many
letters and emails to you voicing their opposition to above‐ground, unsightly, noisy cell towers in their residential
neighborhoods.

Just because the FCC order will become effective in mid‐January doesn’t allow you to sudden completely ignore all this
input. You were elected by vote to represent city residents, many of whom have emphatically and repeatedly told you
they want the cell towers installed underground!

It is a breach of your duty to Palo Alto residents to now abruptly remove the ARB from the aesthetics review process and
approve an amendment allowing one individual the power to indiscriminately change and implement cell tower
installations without first establishing them to be what people of Palo Alto want as far as aesthetics and noise.

Your approval would back the cost‐saving interests of cell phone companies, companies that have not elected you and
to which you are not accountable, flying in the face of clear evidence of your Palo Alto constituents’ wishes. This newly
rewritten amendment takes away the ability of Palo Alto residents to have a say in the aesthetics of their community.
You would be silencing them, not representing them. You would be authorizing one person in the Planning
Commissioner role to decide the effects of cell tower installations on Palo Alto aesthetics without approving standards
to insure that person is at least equal or more qualified than the ARB representatives you would remove from the
current legal process, and without holding that person to any accountability standards for their decision‐making to
relate to the intentions of the people of Palo Alto.

Acting on behalf of Palo Alto residents as elected, please reject this amendment as rewritten and continue to move
forward to find workable solutions to integrate cell tower equipment into residential neighborhoods with the least
aesthetic damage.

Thank you,
Kelly Germa

Subject:             Removal of 40 mature trees on Sherman Avenue


Dear Supervisors,
I am writing to express my distress in hearing that the new garage/police station will require the removal of 40 trees
including mature protected redwoods. Apparently the trees must be removed because the garage was expanded.
I do not think this is a well thought out plan and angers many residents. There has been a large outcry on Nextdoor from
many people about the loss of these trees.

I urge you to revisit this decision, so it does not repeat terrible decision to remove the beautiful mature oaks along
California Avenue.

Sincerely,
Carol Ruth

Subject:             Stop the Verizon Cluster 2 Cell Towers


As long term residence of Palo Alto, I urge you to stop the placement of any additional cellular towers on poles
throughout Palo Alto. We are the owners and residents of 781 Barron Avenue for over 20 years.

We have been opposed to having this project since the beginning. You should enforce Palo Altos aesthetics,
noise and ordinances with respect to the siting and installation of the cell towers near residences. If the towers
are so safe and acceptable, there are plenty of poles closer to Barron Park Elementary School for placement.

Anne and Robert Lum

On behalf of dozens of concerned citizens in Palo Alto, I urge the Council and staff to monitor the
activities of these ABAG/MTC/CASA committees and the subsequent state legislation known as
SB50 et al. We also urge you to keep these committees and legislation on your 2019 Council

These three committees and state legislators are proposing major changes in powers currently held
by local jurisdictions such as Palo Alto. See attachments with live links.

Subject:          Updates on Bay Area economy


http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/insights/

I write a monthly update for the Bay Area Council Economic Institute on recent trends.

There were two posts in December--one on job trends and one on new population estimates

The major takeaways are

--Job growth remain s strong supported by large increases in labor force participation rates with new or
returning entrants attracted by job opportunities

--Population growth is slowing dramatically driven by declining birth rates and increasing out migration
driven by high housing costs.

Both trends suggest challenges are coming in finding new workers and underscore the importance of
increasing housing supply for all income groups.

      Thank you for your letter regarding grade separation considerations. I understand Caltrain has
      discussed these issues with the City in various other venues, but wanted to make sure you have
      a consolidated response to the questions posed in the letter.

         1. Under what conditions would Ca/train accept a grade variance from 1 percent to 2
            percent, and what would the approval process be?

             Caltrain has a standard procedure for design variances. It outlines the approval process
             and required supporting documentation. The allowable maximum grade takes into
             consideration factors such as operational impacts, vehicle performance, proximity to
             stations, other site specific conditions, and maintenance impacts. A comprehensive
             study including operational simulations is required to support the design variance
             request. Additionally, the requester is responsible for the costs to support the variance
             review/analysis.

         2. Under what conditions would Ca/train accept a variance to the existing vertical clearance
            for poles and wires, and what would the approval process be?

             Caltrain minimum clearance to the pole and wires is established to meet California
             Public Utilities Commission requirements such as General Order 95 and SEO 2. Union
             Pacific Railroad also requires minimum clearances.

         3. How are grade separation design criteria and constraints likely to change in the future?

             The Caltrain Business Plan will help shape a long range vision for the corridor and will address
             how train service will grow over time and the kinds of supporting infrastructure that may be
             needed to support this growth. This work will include significant focus on the issue of grade-
             crossings and an effort to develop a corridor-wide strategy to support the funding and

       implementation of grade separations. Any changes to Caltrain's standards must be considered
       in a way that is careful, deliberate and fully and fairly weighs both benefits and consequences,
      and should be undertaken on a system-wide basis. We anticipate working with the City of Palo
      Alto and other corridor communities in the coming year to begin this discussion.

   4. What should the City of Palo Alto assume regarding freight on the Ca/train right-of-way
      in the future?

      The City of Palo Alto should assume that freight will continue to operate diesel
       locomotives along the corridor, even after Caltrain electrifies the line. UPRR use of the
       Caltrain Corridor is governed by the Surface Transportation Board. Subsequently,
       Caltrain has a trackage rights agreement with UPRR that specifies the terms of freight
       operations. After the electrification of the Corridor, it is anticipated that a short-line
       freight operator will replace UPRR. In addition, the Caltrain Corridor is included in the
       STRACNET Corridor which specifies additional requirements to allow shipments of
       military equipment, if needed.

   5. What is Caltrain's criteria regarding shoo/lies that are likely needed for several grade
      separations during construction?

       In general, the shoofly track shall be designed for timetable speed for both passenger
       and freight trains per Caltrain track standards and operating requirements. Except for
       approved construction windows during cut over operations, the proposed grade
       separation design shall keep all Caltrain tracks fully operational at all times and shall
       cause no interruption to train operations during construction. The construction of the
       grade separation shall not temporarily or permanently reduce the future demand on the
       Caltrain operating system and shall meet future Caltrain standards and requirements.

   6. What level of funding support needed to grade separate because of the PCEP can or
       could be expected from Ca/train?

       The Peninsula Corridor Electrification Project (PCEP) does not include any grade
       separations. As stated previously, the Business Plan will identify a long term service
       vision for the corridor and the infrastructure needed to support that service. The Plan
       will also include a strategy for funding these investments over time. It is anticipated that
       a variety of local, regional, state and federal funding sources will be needed to support
       these corridor-wide investments.

              7. The cost of maintenance for grade separation alternatives may vary greatly. What
                 should the City of Palo Alto assume regarding who will pay for the cost of maintenance?

                 Environmental and economic life-cycle assessments should be performed for all
                 alternatives. For a traditional grade separation such as raising and/or lowering the track
                 by embankment, viaduct and bridge, the City of Palo Alto may assume that Caltrain will
                 take on the maintenance responsibility for such new infrastructure. However, the City of
                 Palo Alto may assume it is responsible for the cost to maintain trench and/or tunnel
                 alternatives as they are anticipated to be significantly more expensive to maintain.
                 Additionally, a mixed operation with freight {diesel powered locomotive) and passenger
                 trains in a tunnel is not desired and requires special attention by FRA under High-Speed
                 Passenger Rail Operations. Ultimately, the specific terms of a maintenance agreement
                 would need to be negotiated between Caltrain and the City.

        Again, thank you for these thoughtful questions. As the City continues its assessment of
        potential options, please let us know if more information is needed.

TO: STATE, CITY AND LOCAL OFFICIALS
NOTICE OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMP ANY'S REQUEST TO INCREASE RATES FOR
ITS NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING APPLICATION (A.18-12-008)
Summary
On December 13, 2018, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed its 2018 Nuclear Decommissioning Cost
Triennial Proceeding application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). In this application, PG&E
presents the costs that are necessary to safely and responsibly decommission Diablo Canyon Power Plant and to
complete decommissioning and remediation activities associated with Humboldt Bay Power Plant Unit 3. If this application
is approved, it would increase electric rates beginning in 2020.


Background
Every three years, PG&E is required to file a Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding application with the
CPUC. This current application includes updated decommissioning costs since the 2015 application was filed (A.16-03-
006).
This application is consistent with the CPUC's decision to retire Diablo Canyon Power Plant in 2025 to meet California's
evolving energy policies and increase the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency resources.

The application includes costs related to the following :
• Planning and preparation for decommissioning activities
• Obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and permits
• Demolition and disposal of existing site facilities
• Site restoration activities
• Managing spent nuclear fuel storage until disposal by the Department of Energy
• Maintaining necessary security operations
PG&E is seeking $417 million for each of the years covered in this application, which are 2020, 2021 and 2022.


How will PG&E's application affect electric rates?
Many customers receive bundled electric service from PG&E, meaning they receive electric generation, transmission and
distribution services. Based on rates currently in effect, the bill for a typical residential bundled nonCARE customer using
500 kWh per month would increase from $113.64 to $116.03, or 2.1 percent. Actual impacts will vary depending on
energy usage.

Direct Access and Community Choice Aggregation customers only receive electric transmission and distribution services
from PG&E. On average, these customers will see an increase of 4.2 percent.

Departing Load customers do not receive electric generation, transmission or distribution services from PG&E. However,
they are required by law or CPUC decision to pay certain charges. On average, these customers will see an increase of
39.8 percent.
Detailed rate information is included in a bill insert being sent directly to customers in December 2018 and January 2019.

How do I find out more about PG&E's proposals?
