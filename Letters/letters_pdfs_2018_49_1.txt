           3.      If appointed, what specific goals would you like to see the Planning and Transportation
                   Commission achieve, and why? How would you suggest accomplishing this?

First, I would hope to see the Planning and Transportation improve meeting process in
order to avoid polarization, reach consensus more efficiently, and improve quality of
recommendations to council. I would seek to work toward this goal by modeling effective
communication skills, as honed from my psychology training (e.g., active listening), and
encouraging others on the commission to utilize the same tools to understand others and
express themselves more effectively.
Two of Palo Alto‚Äôs biggest challenges are traffic and parking demand; as such, I believe a
goal of reducing car trips would support a livable, safe, and sustainable Palo Alto. I
believe this goal can be facilitated by implementing programs as outlined in the Bicycle
and Pedestrian Transportation Plan in order to make biking and walking safer and more
enjoyable. Additionally, I hope Palo Alto will explore policy changes, including
behavioral ‚Äúnudges,‚Äù to influence transportation decisions away from driving.
Transportation challenges would be further supported by increasing the supply of housing
within transit-rich areas, such as California Avenue and Downtown. Progress toward this
goal would additionally make Palo Alto more inclusive and equitable, as it would enable
low-income people, seniors, and disabled people to remain in the community and access
services in a safe and time-efficient manner. Furthermore, enabling more people to lead
car-free lifestyles will benefit all Palo Altans by reducing demand for parking and
reducing cars on the roads. I would anticipate that the goal to increase housing near
transit will be, at least partially, facilitated by recent policy changes including the
affordable housing overlay, as well as pending policy changes based on the Housing Work
Plan. To supplement policies to enable increased production of inclusionary market-rate
housing, I believe the city should seek opportunities to utilize public land to create
more subsidized housing units.
In addition to the goal of increased housing production near transit, I would like to see
the Commission explore policies to stave off displacement and loss of existing supply of
multifamily housing. A useful metric in the future may be to measure a net gain in housing
units produced relative to housing units lost in redevelopment. I would suggest
accomplishing the goal of reducing housing unit loss by implementing barriers to
‚Äúdownzoning‚Äù such as requiring public hearing for demolition of multifamily housing. I
would additionally recommend minimizing the harm to displaced renters by implementing
relocation assistance policies.

Employment
                        City ot Palo Alto
Present or Last Employer:
Occupation: City Council member


Describe your involvement in community activities, volunteering or with civic organizations:
I have been active in the community since the 1980's. I was an advocate for land use and water
quality policy. I was a founding member of my neighborhood association. I received the Clean Air
Champion Award in 1997. I served on the City Council from 1998 - 2007; was Mayor in 2003. I
served on multiple regional boards, including the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Bay
Conservation and Development Commission, Valley Transportation Authority and the San
Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority. Recently I have served the City as a member of the
Library Bond Oversight Committee and the current Stormwater Management Oversight
Committee. I was also a member and Vice President of the Community Working Group from
2000-2015.




                                                                                                    Page 2
                                                                      Planning & Transportation Commission
1. What is it about the Planning and Transportation Commission that is compatible with your
experience and of specific interest to you, and why?
1 have always been mterested m governance and the complex problems tacmg commurntJ.es as
they both look back and look into the future. I am interested in how communities grapple wth
change while preserving their core values and the processes used to make decisions. The Planning
Commission plays an important role in exploring issues and advising the City Council to help craft
good public policy.

I am interested in land-use and transportation issues because they set the parameters for the
community's future.




2. Please describe an issue that recently came before the Commission that is of particular interest
to you and describe why you are interested in it. If you have never been to a Commission meeting
you can view an archived video from the Midpen Media Center: LINK.
I was interested in the Commission's review of draft recommendations for the Palo Alto Municipal
Code Title 9 (Trees and Vegetation) because, as a City Council member, I participated in the
creation of the tree protection ordinance. This updated section of the Municipal Code, properly
enforced, achieves multiple community goals: preservation of community character; climate
change and carbon capture; protection of native species and our rich native ecology; prevention of
wildland fires; and encouragement for water-efficient landscaping.

I have also followed the discussion of accessory dwelling units (ADU's and JADU's). The
extensive effort required to implement a workable ordinance that complies with our community
vision has been warranted. ADU's should, over time, provide much-needed new housing in Palo
Alto. I am interested in the extent to which these dwellings will, in fact, provide housing for those
in our community whose income is insufficient for market-rate housing. The trade-offs are
extensive, from parking, set-backs and rear-yard basements, to mechanisms to encourage new
construction and conversion of existing non-complaint structures. Insuring that this State-
mandated ordinance achieves its intended result is, I think, the crux of the problem.




                                                                                                    Page 3
                                                                       Planning & Transportation Commission
3. If appointed, what specific goals would you like to see the Planning and Transportation
Commission achieve, and why? How would you suggest accomplishing this?
The Planning and Transportation Commission plays a key role in providing valuable information
to the City Council. The Commission hears from the public and reviews recommendations from
city staff for compatibility with community interests, planning documents, legal requirements and
to ensure that appropriate attention has been paid to existing and future needs of the community.

As an advisory body, the Commission needs to be involved in the details, but hearings should
acknowledge both public and staff input and focus on providing informed guidance to the Council.

In the course of its work, the Commission should be mindful and respectful of the time and effort
members of the public have invested in topics of concern. Staff recommendations must also be
respected as professional input, requiring serious attention.

The Commission, to be able to provide this respectful service, must focus on the task at hand, and
limit repetitive, disrespectful or irrelevant conversation. The Commission is comprised of seven
members with differing viewpoints, whose job requires working together to craft a recomendation.
 The Commission must work to build a team of members dedicated to their work and interested in
public and staff input.
4. Planning and Transportation Commission Members work with the documents listed below. If
you have experience with any of these documents, please describe that experience. Experience
with these documents is not required for selection.
 Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan LINK
Zoning Code LINK
City Charter LINK
California Environmental Quality Act LINK
 El Camino Real Design Guidelines LINK
El Camino Real Master Plan Study LINK and Appendices LINK
Area Plans such as the South of Forest Avenue (SOFA) I and II Plans LINK
 Baylands Master Plan LINK
I worked extensively with these documents when I was on the City Council. I participated in the
community task force to develop the previous Comprehensive Plan. I recognize that there have
been changes in the last decade and I look forward to exploring them anew. They are the backbone
of our decision-making process.

     Describe your involvement in community activities, volunteering or with civic organizations:
     Extensive involvement in civic activities at multiple levels:
     - City government council, boards and commissions
     - Regional government board and commissions
     - Local nonprofit boards
     Since 1990, I have continuously participated in a wide range of
     activities in support of civic improvement within Palo Alto.  In
     addition to organizations mentioned above, I was a board member
     for the Ronald McDonald at Stanford and was co-president of the
     successful campaign supporting Measure N which funded the
     renovation and rebuilding of our libraries, including the new ma in
     library in south Palo Alto.




                                                                                                         Page 2

1. What is it about the Planning and Transportation Commission that is compatible with your
experience and of specific interest to you, and why?

I served on the PTC for 10 years, including two years as
Chairman. Although I've also served many years on other boards
and commissions, I've always believed that the PTC's role and
format offers the best opportunity for candid and diverse policy
discussions.  This format provides the seven commissioners the
opportunity to jointly develop thoroughly reasoned
recommendations to the Council through public discussion.  This
format also enables the Commission to more completely discuss
public comments as well as to respond to the public, as
appropriate, assuring the public that they and their concerns
have been heard.




2. Please describe an issue that recently came before the Commission that is of particular interest
to you and describe why you are interested in it. If you have never been to a Commission meeting
you can view an archived video from the Midpen Media Center: LINK.
I have a strong interest in the ongoing issue of enabling
affordable housing in Palo Alto, as exemplified by the previous
year's Council and Commission meetings on Palo Alto Housing's
Wilton Avenue project . The continuing strong growth in peninsula
property values has priced many existing and prospective residents
out of the market. Many of our even moderately well-paid
neighbors, employees and family members cannot afford to live
within an hour's commute.  In addition to this inherent need,
state agencies pressure the City to enable more housing than
appears plausible.  Constraints of high underlying land value,
lack of funding and a paucity of large enough sites in suitable
locations mean that realistic projects are often many years in the
making.  I believe I could help in the process of moving forward
those projects that may be possible.




                                                                                                   Page 3

1. What is it about the Planning and Transportation Commission that is compatible with your
experience and of specific interest to you, and why?

Over the last years as I worked in advanced transportation and
land use, and more recently with the citizen' s action on
municipal zoning and city ordinances - I have learned a great
deal about the municipal and state regulations concerning
housing, business, office space, right of ways, and
transportation . I' d like to put this to good use with the City
that I have lived, worked and prospered in.




2. Please describe an issue that recently came before the Commission that is of particular interest
to you and describe why you are interested in it. If you have never been to a Commission meeting
you can view an archived video from the Midpen Media Center: LINK.

Downtown Commercial Caps. It was fascinating to hear the analysis
of existing municipal code and moreover to understand the
framework that the City has developed. Balancing commercial caps
together with housing is complex as the City grows and the
population changes. I got quite an education in historical
municipal code for Palo Alto.




                                                                                                   Page3

3. If appointed, what specific goals would you like to see the Planning and Transportation
Commission achieve, and why? How would you suggest accomplishing this?

I' d like to focus on the balance between commercial caps and the
growing need for housing complete with all of the policy issues.
To accomplish, I' d like to become the 'go-to-expert' on land
use and the associated costs, as well as, looking forward to the
potential for advanced transportation solutions to alleviate
traffic and parking issues.

        PETER BALTAY; Examples of successful Palo Alto projects
        The Garden Court Hotel (1985)-520 Cowper Street
        A good example of stepped massing and artful detailing to minimize the appearance of a large building.
        The hotel creates a pleasant and wonderful street arcade which enhances public liveliness and the
        pedestrian experience. The creative entry staircase and garage entrance also fit well into the streetscape.




        Accel Partners Building (2017)-500 University Avenue
        A recent addition to the University Ave. streetscape on a prominent corner, this building demonstrates that
        increased density can fit into our urban fabric. The deeply recessed and varied street level fa√ßade creates
        numerous opportunities for pedestrians and occupants to enrich the public life on University Avenue. While
        the building is of a modern style, the careful attention to exterior details and high quality craftsmanship
        allow it to be compatible with the eclectic urban fabric of Palo Alto.




        Design Within Reach Storefront (2018)-355 University Avenue
        This completely renovated storefront creatively opens the basement level to retail use, offering an
        enhanced visual display for passers-by and increasing the useful floor area for the owners, all while
        retaining the single-story massing prevalent along this section of University Avenue. The improved
                                                                                                                      -
                                                   -code compliant use was changed as part of the project.

            Architect: Henry Hobson Richardson
            Landscape: Frederick Law Olmsted

            The pre-eminent Architect and Landscape Architect of the mid- 19 th
            Century designed the main quad of Stanford. I admire the massive
            rusticated stonework fa√ßade and arches, the overhanging red tiled
            roof, the continuity of the colonnades, the deeply recessed windows,
            the orthogonal planning with monumental entries. The entire
            complex is a consistent use of these elements.

            Architect: Pei Cobb and Freed

            These two symmetrical buildings are on axis to the previous
            photograph, a continuation of the campus grid. They maintain the
            related campus scale, but the flat stone arches are a modern, more
            delicately scaled design. The second floor is separated from the
            ground floor colonnade, defined around the entire perimeter with a
            setback of continuous windows with a repeat of the red tile deeply
            overhanging roof floating above. The large linear street lined palms
            are a dramatic relation to the lower buildings and a repetition of this
            path-defining feature.

            Architect: Norman Foster

            My favorite new Stanford campus building is the Bio-X. I like the way
            it sweeps around the two sides of a courtyard with all of the
            laboratories facing inward with floor to ceiling glass, revealing the
            fascinating inner work spaces with all of their complex apparatus and
            study areas. Perimeter walkways hung from the roof seems so
            appropriate for California weather with an open bridge connecting
            the two sides of the courtyard. Access to the centrally located open,
            deck level eating areas is convenient. The entire building benefits
            from the free flow of air throughout. The roof follows the curving
            shape of the building but floats free of the lower floors, a dramatic
            departure from the norm.

            Besides the addition to the Canter, the successor firm continued at
            Stanford with the Bing and the Anderson. It is notable how the new
            wing attaches comfortably to the octagonal rear projection of the
            original building, but does so in its own modernist, cubist style,
            symbolic of the contemporary art of the new wing.

            Architect: Joseph Bellomo


            The office structures at University at Alma are a series of raw concrete,
            glass and expressed floor slab forms with a fa√ßade overlay of metal
            screening. The two buildings are designed as separate masses with
            the two-story one on University and the taller structure on the Alma
            corner. A passage between the two connects to High Street. I think
            the massing design decisions were carefully considered, especially the
            decision to divide the forms into separate elements and the use of the
            screening as a unifying and softening element. The assemblage fits
            the shape of the site and the passage as an urban gesture is notable.

            The iconic block of Ramona Street never ceases to intrigue me. Light
            plays on all the varied forms creating a special effect. By having a
            single stucco palette with a general conformance to non-standard
            windows and varied forms allows the entire block to appear to be one
            expression although it was developed at different times and for
            different uses.

            The Hizashi multiple housing building on Lytton near Middlefield,
            though warn at the edges, is a hidden gem. I admire the way it plays
            with the shapes of the residences, walkways and stair towers to form a
            consistent expression. I think it is notable that the designers were
            careful to include the common use of the open courtyard interior
            space and to select very appropriate plantings as shading devices that
            are full-grown now. Because the building is elevated from the street,
            the below grade garage is filled with natural light, a pleasant
            departure from buildings with parking in the cellar.

            A house on a limited sized lot with easement setback requirements
            uses horizontal zinc faced surfaces, exposed steel and glass bays and
            clerestory frames with a contrasting bright colored stucco wall and
            soft, natural grasses and concrete slabs that mirror the receding
            pattern, and subtly lead to a glass enclosed lobby entrance.

    1. What is it about the Architectural Review Board that is compatible with your experience and of
    specific Interest to you, and why?

   I currently serve on the ARB and service to the community is very
   important to me . With my experience at this board as well as my serving
   for 8 years on the San Mateo Planning Commission I can continue to be an
   asset to the community.




                                                                                                   Page2

    2. Please describe an issue that recently came before the Board that is of particular Interest to you
    and describe why you are interested in It If you have never been to a Board meeting you can
    view an archived video from the Midpen Media Center: LINK.
   In my experience i find it is important to give all the issues the same
   importance because each one is important to the applicant and thus also
   to the community. I believe all projects brought before the Board need
   attention to make them a good fit for the residents of the city. A big
   issue for me is the misconception that the Board is only there to serve
   the developers who come before us . I believe our most important role is
   to be fair to all. Neighbors, city residents and applicants.




    3. If appointed, what specific goals would you like to see the Architectural Review Board achieve,
    and why? How would you suggest accomplishing this?

    Continue my quest to show that the Board is there to serve the entire
    community. Homeowners as well as applicants and strive to have the
    final approved project be the best solution for all. A sort of win-win
    solution. A good final solution takes hard work by the Board as well as
    cooperation from the applicant and some give-and-take from the
    neighborhood.




                                                                                                     Page 3
