Subject:                      Don't change the existing Wireless ordinance



Dear Mayor Kniss,

Thank you for ensuring that United Neighbors was notified promptly that City Council will next be
considering the proposed changes to the Wireless ordinance on Monday, March 19th. We look
forward to seeing you and your colleagues at that meeting.

When you meet, I urge you, on behalf of United Neighbors, to vote against changing the Wireless
ordinance. As the City Attorney wrote to City Council in her 4/29/15 report regarding what is now the
existing ordinance, this ordinance requires—and “require” is her word—that no new or collocated cell
towers may be installed in Palo Alto without both an architectural review and conditional use permit
findings. Yet now Senior Staff are recommending you allow the Director of Planning, if she so
chooses, to bypass ARB and PTC review of these cell towers.

The fact is, now more than ever, both an architectural review and conditional use permit findings are
necessary to protect residents from the juggernaut that is the telecom industry as it seeks to install
commercial facilities next to our homes. Now is not the time--when applications for new cell towers
here are at 150 and counting--to make it easier for Verizon, AT&T et al. to come into Palo Alto’s
residential neighborhoods and do as they please. In fact, most other California cities are currently in
the process of making their Wireless ordinances tougher, not weakening them.

Please consider, what sense does it make to dispense with the experience, professionalism and
depth of knowledge of the Architectural Review Board when dealing with this critical issue? And what
possible virtue can there be in changing the ordinance so that, at the Director’s discretion, the only
way residents would be able make their views heard in a public forum—or to go face-to-face with the
telecom companies—would be to pay to appeal proposed cell towers?

Why, in short, should the power to review cell tower applications be taken out of the hands of experts,
removed from public forums, and turned over to Senior City Staff? Why should these decisions be
made behind closed doors? And where's the transparency Palo Alto residents are entitled to expect
from the people running the City?

The fact that the proposed changes to the code do not dictate that the Director bypass the ARB and
the PTC cannot disguise the fact that these changes would permit the Director to do so—with no
explanation to the public, to City Council or to anyone else..

The changes Staff want you to make to the existing code may be good for them by, for example,
allowing them to avoid time-consuming preparations for ARB and PTC hearings. But these changes
are bad for residents. And they fly in the face of good governance.

I am aware, of course, that you are generally sympathetic to the interests of developers in Palo
Alto. And I am aware, as well, that developers always want more infrastructure, and cell towers are
infrastructure. But I'm counting on you to also care about the residents of Palo Alto and to protect
them against the invasion of unnecessarily ugly, noisy, bulky and hazardous cell towers that Verizon
and others are currently proposing.

Thank you for your attention. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:                      Don't change the existing Wireless ordinance



Dear City Council Members,

I urge you, on behalf of Palo Alto residents, to vote against changing the Wireless ordinance. As the
City Attorney wrote to City Council in her 4/29/15 report regarding what is now the existing ordinance,
this ordinance requires—and “require” is her word—that no new or collocated cell towers may be
installed in Palo Alto without both an architectural review and conditional use permit findings. Yet now
Senior Staff are recommending you allow the Director of Planning, if she so chooses, to bypass ARB
and PTC review of these cell towers.

The fact is, now more than ever, both an architectural review and conditional use permit findings are
necessary to protect residents. On a case-by-case basis it is absolutely necessary for the city to
review requests to place cell phone towers in residential neighborhoods.

For example, a sign proposing a Verizon cell phone tower has appeared in the Triple El neighborhood
and it makes no sense to install a cell phone tower in this neighborhood for the following reasons.
·    The proposed location is central to homes where children, elderly and retirees are at home 24
hours a day and will be exposed to high levels of radiation (lots of data on this!)
·     Verizon is optimizing their plan for ease of access and NOT to minimize exposure of radiation to
citizens (This is just wrong).
·     Our neighborhood has good Verizon coverage right now. Even the Verizon maps show that we
are in good shape.
·     The houses in the triple El neighborhood that have poles and wires already bear the burden of
additional radiation and maintenance for the neighborhood; let alone that the poles and wires are
unsightly. Why penalize the same homeowners for phones?
·   There are just a whole lot better places to put these poles e.g. NOT in the middle of densely
populated neighborhoods.

It is essential that you continue to protect the safety of Palo Alto residents and push back on utility
companies who’s primary concern is profit and who are not concerned with public safety or
neighborhood well being.

Dear Council Members,

I am a 50 year resident of Palo Alto, and am unhappy about the proliferation of cell towers in our residential
neighborhoods. The towers are ugly, noisy and they emit radiation potentially affecting our health. I have a tower within a
half block of my house and experience it every day.

I understand you will vote soon to make the process easier for companies to install these devices by allowing the
Director of Planning to bypass ARB and PTC review of these cell towers.



I ask that you DO NOT approve the request by City Staff to take the ARB and PTC out of the
approval process.
The ARB and PTC are part of the public approval process to assure transparency and allow maximum expert and public
input on controversial issues, such as "implanting" cell towers into our neighborhoods.

Thank you,

Alan Cooper

 1       Abstract

 2       The US National Toxicology Program (NTP) has carried out extensive rodent toxicology and

 3       carcinogenesis studies of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) at frequencies and modulations used in

 4       the US telecommunications industry. This report presents partial findings from these studies. The

 5       occurrences of two tumor types in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats exposed to RFR, malignant

 6       gliomas in the brain and schwannomas of the heart, were considered of particular interest, and

 7       are the subject of this report. The findings in this report were reviewed by expert peer reviewers

 8       selected by the NTP and National Institutes of Health (NIH). These reviews and responses to

 9       comments are included as appendices to this report, and revisions to the current document have

10       incorporated and addressed these comments. Supplemental information in the form of 4

11       additional manuscripts has or will soon be submitted for publication. These manuscripts describe

12       in detail the designs and performance of the RFR exposure system, the dosimetry of RFR

13       exposures in rats and mice, the results to a series of pilot studies establishing the ability of the

14       animals to thermoregulate during RFR exposures, and studies of DNA damage.

 6       SUMMARY

 7       The purpose of this communication is to report partial findings from a series of radiofrequency

 8       radiation (RFR) cancer studies in rats performed under the auspices of the U.S. National

 9       Toxicology Program (NTP).1 This report contains peer-reviewed, neoplastic and hyperplastic

10       findings only in the brain and heart of Hsd:Sprague Dawley® SD® (HSD) rats exposed to RFR

11       starting in utero and continuing throughout their lifetimes. These studies found low incidences of

12       malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart of male rats exposed to RFR of the

13       two types [Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile

14       Communications (GSM)] currently used in U.S. wireless networks. Potentially preneoplastic

15       lesions were also observed in the brain and heart of male rats exposed to RFR.

16

17       The review of partial study data in this report has been prompted by several factors. Given the

18       widespread global usage of mobile communications among users of all ages, even a very small

19       increase in the incidence of disease resulting from exposure to RFR could have broad

20       implications for public health. There is a high level of public and media interest regarding the

21       safety of cell phone RFR and the specific results of these NTP studies.

 1       Lastly, the tumors in the brain and heart observed at low incidence in male rats exposed to GSM-

 2       and CDMA-modulated cell phone RFR in this study are of a type similar to tumors observed in

 3       some epidemiology studies of cell phone use. These findings appear to support the International

 4       Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) conclusions regarding the possible carcinogenic

 5       potential of RFR.2

 7       It is important to note that this document reviews only the findings from the brain and heart and

 8       is not a complete report of all findings from the NTP’s studies. Additional data from these

 9       studies in Hsd:Sprague Dawley® SD® (Harlan) rats and similar studies conducted in B6C3F1/N

10       mice are currently under evaluation and will be reported together with the current findings in two

11       forthcoming NTP Technical Reports.

13       STUDY RATIONALE

14       Cell phones and other commonly used wireless communication devices transmit information via

15       non-ionizing radiofrequency radiation (RFR). In 2013, IARC classified RFR as a possible human

16       carcinogen based on “limited evidence” of an association between exposure to RFR from heavy

17       wireless phone use and glioma and acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) in human

18       epidemiology studies, and “limited evidence” for the carcinogenicity of RFR in experimental

19       animals. While ionizing radiation is a well-accepted human carcinogen, theoretical arguments

20       have been raised against the possibility that non-ionizing radiation could induce tumors

21       (discussed in IARC, 2013). Given the extremely large number of people who use wireless

 2       exposure to the RFR generated by those devices could have broad implications for public health.

 4       DESCRIPTION OF THE NTP CELL PHONE RFR PROGRAM

 5       RFR emitted by wireless communication devices, especially cell phones, was nominated to the

 6       NTP for toxicology and carcinogenicity testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

 7       (FDA). After careful and extensive evaluation of the published literature and experimental

 8       efforts already underway at that time, the NTP concluded that additional studies were warranted

 9       to more clearly define any potential health hazard to the U.S. population. Due to the technical

10       complexity of such studies, NTP staff worked closely with RFR experts from the National

11       Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). With support from NTP, engineers at NIST

12       evaluated various types of RFR exposure systems and demonstrated the feasibility of using a

13       specially designed exposure system (reverberation chambers), which resolved the inherent

14       limitations identified in existing systems.


15       In general, NTP chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studies expose laboratory rodents to a test

16       article for up to 2 years and are designed to determine the potential for the agent tested to be

17       hazardous and/or carcinogenic to humans.3 For cell phone RFR, a program of study was

18       designed to evaluate potential, long-term health effects of whole-body exposures. These studies

19       were conducted in three phases: (1) a series of pilot studies to establish field strengths that do not

20       raise body temperature, (2) 28-day toxicology studies in rodents exposed to various low-level

21       field strengths, and (3) chronic toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. The studies were carried

22       out under contract at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) in Chicago, IL following Good Laboratory

 1       Practices (GLP). These studies were conducted in rats and mice using a reverberation chamber

 2       exposure system with two signal modulations [Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and

 3       Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)] at two frequencies (900 MHz for rats and

 4       1900 MHz for mice), the modulations and frequency bands that are primarily used in the United

 5       States.

 6

 7       STUDY DESIGN

 8       Hsd:Sprague Dawley® SD® (Harlan) rats were housed in custom-designed reverberation

 9       chambers and exposed to cell phone RFR. Experimentally generated 900 MHz RF fields with

10       either GSM or CDMA modulation were continuously monitored in real-time during all exposure

11       periods via RF sensors located in each exposure chamber that recorded RF field strength (V/m).

12       Animal exposure levels are reported as whole-body specific absorption rate (SAR), a biological

13       measure of exposure based on the deposition of RF energy into an absorbing organism or tissue.

14       SAR is defined as the energy (watts) absorbed per mass of tissue (kilograms). Rats were exposed

15       to GSM- or CDMA-modulated RFR at 900 MHz with whole-body SAR exposures of 0, 1.5, 3, or

16       6 W/kg. RFR field strengths were frequently adjusted based on changes in body weight to

17       maintain desired SAR levels.

18

19       Exposures to RFR were initiated in utero beginning with the exposure of pregnant dams

20       (approximately 11-14 weeks of age) on Gestation Day (GD) 5 and continuing throughout

21       gestation. After birth, dams and pups were exposed in the same cage through weaning on

22       postnatal day (PND) 21, at which point the dams were removed and exposure of 90 pups per sex

23       per group was continued for up to 106 weeks. Pups remained group-housed from PND 21 until

24       they were individually housed on PND 35. Control and treatment groups were populated with no


                                                                            7

 1       more than 3 pups per sex per litter. All RF exposures were conducted over a period of

 2       approximately 18 hours using a continuous cycle of 10 minutes on (exposed) and 10 minutes off

 3       (not exposed), for a total daily exposure time of approximately 9 hours a day, 7 days/week. A

 4       single, common group of unexposed animals of each sex served as controls for both RFR

 5       modulations. These control rats were housed in identical reverberation chambers with no RF

 6       signal generation. Each chamber was maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, within a

 7       temperature range of 72 ± 3°F, a humidity range of 50 ± 15%, and with at least 10 air changes

 8       per hour. Throughout the studies, all animals were provided ad libitum access to feed and water.

 9

10       RESULTS

11       In pregnant rats exposed to 900 MHz GSM- or CDMA-modulated RFR, no exposure-related

12       effects were observed on the percent of dams littering, litter size, or sex distribution of pups.

13       Small, exposure-level-dependent reductions (up to 7%) in body weights compared to controls

14       were observed throughout gestation and lactation in dams exposed to GSM- or CDMA-

15       modulated RFR. In the offspring, litter weights tended to be lower (up to 9%) in GSM and

16       CDMA RFR-exposed groups compared to controls. Early in the lactation phase, body weights of

17       male and female pups were lower in the GSM-modulated (8%) and CDMA-modulated (15%)

18       RFR groups at 6 W/kg compared to controls. These weight differences in the offspring for both

19       GSM and CDMA exposures tended to lessen (6% and 10%, respectively) as lactation progressed.

20       Throughout the remainder of the chronic study, no RFR exposure-related effects on body

21       weights were observed in male and female rats exposed to RFR, regardless of modulation.

 1       At the end of the 2-year study, survival was lower in the control group of males than in all

 2       groups of male rats exposed to GSM-modulated RFR. Survival was also slightly lower in control

 3       females than in females exposed to 1.5 or 6 W/kg GSM-modulated RFR. In rats exposed to

 4       CDMA-modulated RFR, survival was higher in all groups of exposed males and in the 6 W/kg

 5       females compared to controls.

 6

 7       Brain

 8       A low incidence of malignant gliomas and glial cell hyperplasia was observed in all groups of

 9       male rats exposed to GSM-modulated RFR (Table 1). In males exposed to CDMA-modulated

10       RFR, a low incidence of malignant gliomas occurred in rats exposed to 6 W/kg (Table 1). Glial

11       cell hyperplasia was also observed in the 1.5 W/kg and 6 W/kg CDMA-modulated exposure

12       groups. No malignant gliomas or glial cell hyperplasias were observed in controls. There was not

13       a statistically significant difference between the incidences of lesions in exposed male rats

14       compared to control males for any of the GSM- or CDMA-modulated RFR groups. However,

15       there was a statistically significant positive trend in the incidence of malignant glioma (p < 0.05)

16       for CDMA-modulated RFR exposures.

 2       In females exposed to GSM-modulated RFR, a malignant glioma was observed in a single rat

 3       exposed to 6 W/kg, and glial cell hyperplasia was observed in a single rat exposed to 3 W/kg

 4       (Table 2). In females exposed to CDMA-modulated RFR, malignant gliomas were observed in

 5       two rats exposed to 1.5 W/kg. Glial cell hyperplasia was observed in one female in each of the

 6       CDMA-modulation exposure groups (1.5, 3, and 6 W/kg). There was no glial cell hyperplasia or

 7       malignant glioma observed in any of the control females. Detailed descriptions of the malignant

 8       gliomas and glial cell hyperplasias are presented in Appendix C.

17       Cardiac schwannomas were observed in male rats in all exposed groups of both GSM- and

18       CDMA-modulated RFR, while none were observed in controls (Table 3). For both modulations

19       (GSM and CDMA), there was a significant positive trend in the incidence of schwannomas of

20       the heart with respect to exposure SAR. Additionally, the incidence of schwannomas in the 6

21       W/kg males was significantly higher in CDMA-modulated RFR-exposed males compared to

22       controls. The incidence of schwannomas in the 6 W/kg GSM-modulated RFR-exposed males

23       was higher, but not statistically significant (p = 0.052) compared to controls. Schwann cell

 1       Schwann cells are present in the peripheral nervous system and are distributed throughout the

 2       whole body, not just in the heart. Therefore, organs other than the heart were examined for

 3       schwannomas and Schwann cell hyperplasia. Several occurrences of schwannomas were

 4       observed in the head, neck, and other sites throughout the body of control and GSM and CDMA

 5       RFR-exposed male rats. In contrast to the significant increase in the incidence of schwannomas

 6       in the heart of exposed males, the incidence of schwannomas observed in other tissue sites of

 7       exposed males (GSM and CDMA modulations) was not significantly different than in controls

 8       (Table 5). Additionally, Schwann cell hyperplasia was not observed in any tissues other than the

 9       heart. The combined incidence of schwannomas from all sites was generally higher in GSM- and

10       CDMA-modulated RFR exposed males, but not significantly different than in controls. The

11       Schwann cell response to RFR appears to be specific to the heart of male rats.

 8       DISCUSSION

 9       The two tumor types, which are the focus of this report, are malignant gliomas of the brain and

10       schwannomas of the heart. Glial cells are a collection of specialized, non-neuronal, support cells

11       whose functions include maintenance of homeostasis, formation of myelin, and providing

12       support and protection for neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central

13       nervous system (CNS). In the CNS, glial cells include astrocytes, oligodendrogliocytes,

14       microglial cells, and ependymal cells. Schwann cells are classified as glial cells of the PNS. In

15       the PNS, Schwann cells produce myelin and are analogous to oligodendrocytes of the CNS.

16       Generally, glial neoplasms in the rat are aggressive, poorly differentiated, and usually classified

17       as malignant.

18

19       In the heart, exposure to GSM or CDMA modulations of RFR in male rats resulted in a

20       statistically significant, positive trend in the incidence of schwannomas. There was also a

21       statistically significant, pairwise increase at the highest CDMA exposure level tested compared

22       to controls. Schwann cell hyperplasias also occurred at the highest exposure level of CDMA-




                                                                            13

 1       modulated RFR. Schwann cell hyperplasia in the heart may progress to cardiac schwannomas.

 2       No Schwann cell hyperplasias or schwannomas of the heart were observed in the single,

 3       common control group of male rats. The historical control rate of schwannomas of the heart in

 4       male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats is 1.30% (7/539) and ranges from 0-6% for individual NTP

 5       studies (Table D2, Appendix D). The 5.5-6.6% observed in the 6 W/kg GSM- and CDMA-

 6       modulated RFR groups exceeds the historical incidence, and approaches or exceeds the highest

 7       rate observed in a single study (6%). The increase in the incidence of schwannomas in the heart

 8       of male rats in this study is likely the result of whole-body exposures to GSM- or CDMA-

 9       modulated RFR.

10

11       In the brain, there was a significant, positive trend in the incidences of malignant gliomas in

12       males exposed to CDMA-modulated RFR, and a low incidence was observed in males at all

13       exposure levels of GSM-modulated RFR that was not statistically different than in control males.

14       Glial cell hyperplasia, a preneoplastic lesion distinctly different from gliosis, was also observed

15       at low incidences in rats exposed to either GSM or CDMA modulation. Glial cell hyperplasia

16       may progress to malignant glioma. Neither of these lesions was observed in the control group of

17       male rats. Although not observed in the current control group, malignant gliomas have been

18       observed in control male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats from other completed NTP studies.

19       Currently in males, the historical control rate of malignant glioma for those studies is 2.0%

20       (11/550) and ranges from 0-8% for individual studies (Table D1, Appendix D). The 2.2-3.3%

21       observed in all of the GSM-modulation groups and in the 6 W/kg CDMA-modulated group only

22       slightly exceeds the mean historical control rate and falls within the observed range.

 1       The survival of the control group of male rats in the current study (28%) was relatively low

 2       compared to other recent NTP studies in Hsd:Sprague Dawley® SD® (Harlan) rats (average 47%,

 3       range 24-72%). If malignant gliomas or schwannomas are late-developing tumors, the absence of

 4       these lesions in control males in the current study could conceivably be related to the shorter

 5       longevity of control rats in this study. Appendix E lists the time on study for each animal with a

 6       malignant glioma or heart schwannoma. Most of the gliomas were observed in animals that died

 7       late in the study, or at the terminal sacrifice. However, a relatively high number of the heart

 8       schwannomas in exposed groups were observed by 90 weeks into the study, a time when

 9       approximately 60 of the 90 control male rats remained alive and at risk for developing a tumor.

11       CONCLUSIONS

12       Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, the hyperplastic lesions and glial cell neoplasms of

13       the heart and brain observed in male rats are considered likely the result of whole-body

14       exposures to GSM- or CDMA-modulated RFR. There is higher confidence in the association

15       between RFR exposure and the neoplastic lesions in the heart than in the brain. No biologically

16       significant effects were observed in the brain or heart of female rats regardless of modulation.

18       NEXT STEPS

19       The results reported here are limited to select findings of concern in the brain and heart and do

20       not represent a complete reporting of all findings from these studies of cell phone RFR. The

21       complete results for all NTP studies on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of GSM and CDMA-

22       modulated RFR are currently being reviewed and evaluated according to the established NTP

23       process and will be reported together with the current findings in two forthcoming NTP




                                                                            15

1       Technical Reports. Given the large scale and scope of these studies, completion of this process is

2       anticipated by fall 2017, and the draft NTP Technical Reports are expected to be available for

3       peer review and public comment by the end of 2017. We anticipate that the results from a series

4       of initial studies investigating the tolerance to various power levels of RFR, including

5       measurements of body temperatures in both sexes of young and old rats and mice and in

6       pregnant female rats, will be published in the peer-reviewed literature later in 2016.

 1                                          APPENDIX B – STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
 2
 3       The Poly-k test (Bailer and Portier, 1988; Portier and Bailer, 1989; Piegorsch and Bailer, 1997)
 4       was used to assess neoplasm prevalence. This test is a survival-adjusted quantal-response
 5       procedure that modifies the Cochran-Armitage linear trend test to take survival differences into
 6       account. More specifically, this method modifies the denominator in the quantal estimate of
 7       lesion incidence to approximate more closely the total number of animal years at risk. For
 8       analysis of lesion incidence at a given site, each animal is assigned a risk weight. This value is
 9       one if the animal had a lesion at that site or if it survived until terminal sacrifice; if the animal
10       died prior to terminal sacrifice and did not have a lesion at that site, its risk weight is the fraction
11       of the entire study time that it survived, raised to the kth power. This method yields a lesion
12       prevalence rate that depends only upon the choice of a shape parameter, k, for a Weibull hazard
13       function describing cumulative lesion incidence over time (Bailer and Portier, 1988). A further
14       advantage of the Poly-k method is that it does not require lesion lethality assumptions.
15
16       Unless otherwise specified, the NTP uses a value of k=3 in the analysis of site-specific lesions
17       (Portier et al., 1986). Bailer and Portier (1988) showed that the Poly-3 test gives valid results if
18       the true value of k is anywhere in the range from 1 to 5. In addition, Portier et al. (1986) modeled
19       a collection of relatively common tumors observed in control animals from two-year NTP rodent
20       carcinogenicity studies, showing that the Weibull distribution with values of k ranging between 1
21       and 5 was a reasonable fit to tumor incidence in most cases. In cases of early tumor onset or late
22       tumor onset, however, k=3 may not be the optimal choice. Tumors with early onset would
23       require a value of k much less than 3, while tumors with late onset would require a value of k
24       much greater than 3. In the current studies, malignant brain gliomas occurred only in animals
25       surviving more than 88% of the length of the study. For these brain tumors, a Weibull
26       distribution with k=6 is a better fit to survival time than with k=3 (Portier, 1986). Malignant
27       schwannomas of the heart occurred in animals surviving at least 65% of the length of the study; a
28       Weibull distribution with k=3 adequately fits these heart tumor incidences. Therefore, poly-6
29       tests were used for analyses of brain tumors and poly-3 tests were used for schwannomas.

 1       Variation introduced by the use of risk weights, which reflect differential mortality, was
 2       accommodated by adjusting the variance of the Poly-k statistic as recommended by Bieler and
 3       Williams (1993) and a continuity correction modified from Thomas et al. (1977) was applied.
 4
 5       Tests of significance for tumors and nonneoplastic lesions included pairwise comparisons of
 6       each dosed group with controls and a test for an overall dose-related trend. Continuity-corrected
 7       Poly-k tests were used in the analysis of lesion incidence, and reported P values are one sided.
 8
 9       Body weights and litter weights were compared to the control group using analysis of variance
10       and Dunnett’s test (1955). The probability of survival was estimated by the product-limit
11       procedure of Kaplan and Meier (1958). Statistical analyses for possible exposure-related effects
12       on survival used Cox’s (1972) method for testing two groups for equality and Tarone’s (1975)
13       life table test to identify exposure-related trends. Survival analysis p-values are two-sided.

 2
 3       Pathology data presented in this report on cell phone RFR were subjected to a rigorous peer
 4       review process. The primary goal of the NTP peer-review process is to reach consensus
 5       agreement on treatment-related findings, confirm the diagnosis of all neoplasms, and confirm
 6       any unusual lesions. At study termination, a complete necropsy and histopathology evaluation
 7       was conducted on every animal. The initial pathology examination was performed by a
 8       veterinary pathologist, who recorded all neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions. This examination
 9       identified several potential treatment-related lesions in target organs of concern (brain and heart),
10       which were chosen for immediate review.1 The initial findings of glial cell tumors and
11       hyperplasias in the brain and schwannomas, Schwann call hyperplasia, and schwannomas from
12       all sites were subjected to an expedited, multilevel NTP pathology peer-review process. The data
13       were locked2 prior to receipt of the finalized, study-laboratory reports to ensure that the raw data
14       did not change during the review.
15
16       The pathology peer review consisted of a quality assessment (QA) review of all slides with
17       tissues from the central nervous system (7 sections of brain and 3 sections of spinal cord),
18       trigeminal nerve and ganglion, and heart. Additionally, the schwannomas of the head and neck
19       region were reviewed. The QA review of the central nervous system and head and neck
20       schwannomas was performed by Dr. Margarita Gruebbel of Experimental Pathology
21       Laboratories, Inc. (EPL), and the QA review of the hearts and trigeminal nerves and ganglia was
22       performed by Dr. Cynthia Shackelford, EPL.
23
24       The QA review pathologists then met with Dr. Mark Cesta, NTP pathologist for these studies,
25       and Dr. David Malarkey, head of the NTP Pathology Group, to review lesions and select slides
26       for the Pathology Working Group (PWG) reviews. All PWG reviews were conducted blinded
27       with respect to treatment group and only identified the test articles as “test agent A” or “test

 1       agent B”. Due to the large number of slides for review, the PWG was held in three separate
 2       sessions:
 3                •    January 29, 2016, for review of glial lesions in the brain and Schwann cell lesions in the
 4                     heart
 5                •    February 11, 2016, for review of schwannomas of the head and neck
 6                •    February 12, 2016, for review of granular cell lesions of the brain
 7
 8       The reviewing PWG pathologists largely agreed on the diagnostic criteria for the lesions and on
 9       the diagnoses of schwannomas in the head and neck, and granular cell lesions in the brain.
10       However, there was much discussion on the criteria for differentiating glial cell hyperplasia from
11       malignant glioma and Schwann cell hyperplasia from schwannoma. The lack of PWG agreement
12       on definitive criteria for the glial cell and Schwann cell lesions, and the requirement for a high
13       level of confidence in the diagnoses prompted NTP to convene two additional PWGs (organized
14       and conducted by the NTP pathologist, Dr. Mark Cesta) with selected experts in the organ under
15       review. These second level PWG reviews were also conducted as noted above and held in two
16       separate sessions:
17            •       February 25, 2016, for review of glial lesions in the brain
18            •       March 3, 2016, for review of cardiac schwannomas, schwannomas in other organs
19                    (except the head and neck), and right ventricular degeneration
20
21       In both PWGs, the participants came to consensus on the diagnoses of the lesions and the criteria
22       used for those diagnoses. Participants of the individual PWGs are listed below.

 2       LESION DESCRIPTIONS
 3       Brain
 4       Malignant gliomas were infiltrative lesions, usually of modest size, with indistinct tumor
 5       margins. The neoplastic cells were typically very densely packed with more cells than neuropil.
 6       The cells were typically small and had round to oval, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitoses were
 7       infrequent. In some of the neoplasms, invasion of the meninges, areas of necrosis surrounded by
 8       palisading neoplastic cells, cuffing of blood vessels, and neuronal satellitosis were observed. The
 9       malignant gliomas did not appear to arise from any specific anatomic subsite of the brain.
10
11       Glial cell hyperplasia consisted of small, proliferative, and poorly demarcated foci of poorly
12       differentiated glial cells that accumulated and invaded into the surrounding parenchyma. In some
13       cases, there was a small amount of perivascular cuffing. The hyperplastic cells appeared
14       morphologically identical to those in the gliomas but were typically less dense with more
15       neuropil than glial cells. There were no necrotic or degenerative elements present, so there was
16       no evidence that the increased number of glial cells was a reaction to brain injury.
17
18       Heart
19       The intracardiac schwannomas were either endocardial or myocardial (intramural). The
20       endocardial schwannomas lined the ventricles and atria and invaded into the myocardium. Two
21       morphologic cell types were observed, but indistinct cell margins and eosinophilic cytoplasm
22       were common to both types. Groups of cells with widely spaced small, round nuclei and
23       moderate amounts of cytoplasm were interspersed among bands or sheets of parallel, elongated
24       cells with thin, spindle-shaped, hyperchromatic nuclei. The myocardial schwannomas were
25       typically less densely cellular and infiltrated amid, sometimes replacing, the cardiomyocytes.
26       The cell types described for the endocardial neoplasms were both present, but in fewer numbers.
27       In both subtypes of schwannomas, there was a minimal amount of cellular pleomorphism. In
28       some larger neoplasms, Antoni type A and B patterns were present.

1       The Schwann cell hyperplasias were similar in appearance to the schwannomas, but were smaller
2       and had less pleomorphism of the cells. In the case of the endocardial Schwann cell hyperplasia,
3       there was no invasion of the myocardium.

 7       reviewers were blind to the test agents under study. Introductory materials on RFR and details of
 8       the methods dealing with the field generation and animal housing were redacted from the version
 9       sent to the reviewers. The reviewers were provided a study data package, also blinded to test
10       agents, containing basic in life study information such as body weight and survival curves and
11       information concerning the generation of pups from the in utero exposures.

28                  All three reviewers found the results to be clearly and objectively presented, although
29                  there were suggestions to provide historical control information for brain and heart
30                  lesions for female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats, clarify statements about the specific

 5                  reasonable. Please explain why or why not.
 6
 7                  The reviewers stated that the NTP had performed an adequate and objective peer review
 8                  of the pathology data, and the statistical approaches used were consistent with other NTP
 9                  studies. The methods were described as objective and reasonable. The interpretations of
10                  the data, including the limitations, were also reasonable and objective. One reviewer
11                  found the data on schwannomas of the heart to be more compelling with respect to an
12                  association with treatment than the brain gliomas. This reviewer summarized the findings
13                  as:
14
15                             “In the heart the evidence for a carcinogenic effect can be based on 1) the
16                            presence of the tumors in all six of the test article groups versus none in the
17                            controls 2) the statistically significant trend for schwannomas with both
18                            compounds and the statistically significant increase in incidence in the 4X (top)
19                            dose for test article B; 3) the fact that the incidence of the tumors in both 4X dose
20                            groups approaches or exceeds the high end of the historical control range; and 4)
21                            the tumors in the 4X group of test article B are accompanied by a higher
22                            incidence of Schwann cell hyperplasia. Using the NTP’s guide for levels of
23                            evidence for carcinogenic activity, I would consider the heart schwannomas as
24                            ‘Some Evidence’ of carcinogenic activity.
25
26                            The proliferative lesions in the brain are more difficult to interpret because 1)
27                            their low incidence that was well within the historical control range, 2) lack of
28                            clear dose response; and 3) lack of statistical significance (except for the
29                            significant exposure-dependent trend for test article B. . . . However, the presence
30                            of malignant gliomas and/or foci of glial cell hyperplasia in 5 of 6 test article
31                            groups for both sexes vs none in controls of either sex is suggestive of a test

 6            One reviewer suggested that more information be given on the time when tumors were
 7            observed (e.g., at terminal necropsy, or early in the study) to help assess the possible impact
 8            of the decreased survival times in the control animals on tumor incidence. This reviewer also
 9            suggested a discussion of how the survival of control male rats in this study compared to the
10            historical control data. There was also concern that the diagnostic criteria developed by the
11            PWG and used in the current study would impact the historical control incidence rates
12            reported in Table D.
13
14       3. The scientific evidence supports NTP’s conclusion(s) for the study findings:
15
16            The NTP’s overall draft conclusion was as follows: “Under the conditions of these studies,
17            the observed hyperplastic lesions and neoplasms outlined in this partial report are considered
18            likely the result of exposures to test article A and test article B. The findings in the heart were
19            statistically stronger than the findings in the brain.”
20
21            The reviewers had the option of agreeing, agreeing in principle, or disagreeing with the draft
22            conclusions. All three reviewers agreed in principle, reiterating issues discussed above.

    Dr. Tabak,

    I’ve always relied on experts, not myself, for statistical	  analysis, and so do not feel	  qualified to address
    the statistical methods used. My training and experience has been in veterinary pathology, including QA
    review of	  NTP studies, and serving on PWGs, so will give my opinion on the pathology interpretation
    (biological significance rather	  than statistical significance).

    Having perused the 3 RFR Draft Report and the	  raw data, all appears to be in order, including QA of	  the
    histopathology (technique) as	  well as	  PWG review (diagnosis). Looking at the data, I agree with the
    report’s	  conclusion:	   Under the conditions of these studies, the hyperplastic lesions and neoplasms
    observed	  in	  male rats are considered	  likely the result of	  exposures to GSM-­‐ an CDMA-­‐modulated RFR.
    The findings in	  the heart were statistically stronger than	  the findings in	  the brain. But note, it is
    “considered likely”	  not “definitely is”.

    There may be also several caveats relating to “under	  the conditions of these studies”,	  including how well	  
    the conditions recapitulate actual human exposure: whole body exposure from in utero to old age;	  18.5
    hours/day (10 min on/10 min off, for	  total of	  9hr	  actual exposure);	  and doseA. I’m not physicist, so
    have to	  presume experts analyzed and accepted concept of the	  reverberation chamber, including
    “doses”A as being relevant to human exposure.
    A
      Dosimetric Assessment paper: “As could be expected in a study	  following NTP protocols, the exposure
    levels for the rodents in this project	  exceed the limits for the wbSAR and psSAR defined in the IEEE Std
    C95.1-­‐2005	  safety standard for	  human exposure to mobile phone radiation. In	  the low dose exposure
    group the	  exposure level	  in the organs exceeds or is close to the localized SAR limit for the general	  
    public, except for a few low-­‐water content tissues. More specifically, the psSAR over	  1 g in the human
    head, is limited	  by the safety standards to	  <2W/kg, whereas, in the low dose rodents the SAR averaged
    over the whole brain	  is >2.4 W/kg for mice, and	  >1.3 W/kg for rats, hence similar to the limit.
    Furthermore, the	  psSAR and oSAR have larger uncertainty compared to the wbSAR.	  Deviations of the
    exposure	  level from the	  target dose, especially during the early exposure period, should	  be carefully
    evaluated in the interpretation of	  the final biological studies.

    Results from the companion	  mouse study will hopefully add	  some insight.

    Michael S Lauer, MD (OER)
    Review of NTP paper: “Report of Partial Findings from the National Toxicology Program
    Carcinogenesis Studies of Cell Phone Radiofrequency Radiation (Whole Body Exposures)”
    March 20, 2016

    Summary of findings:

    This is a partial report, a report which is presumably part of a larger set of studies involving 2
    species (mice and rats), 2 sexes (male, female), and multiple tissue types, all based on 90-week
    studies of two different types (GSM and CDMA) of cell phone radiofrequency radiation (RFR).
    In this partial report, we are given findings regarding brain gliomas and heart schwannomas in
    male and female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats which were exposed exposed to control or 3
    different levels (1.5, 3.0, 6.0) of two types (GSM and CDMA) of RFR. There were 90 rats in each
    group. Using the poly-3 test with the Bieler-Williams variance adjustment, the authors found a
    statistically significant increase in the rate of brain gliomas in males exposed to CDMA RFR.
    Using the poly-6 test, the authors found a statistically significant increase in the rates of heart
    schwannomas in males exposed to GSM and CDMA. There were no statistically significant
    differences in rates of gliomas or schwannomas in females; also there was no statistically
    significant increase in rates of gliomas in males exposed to GSM RFR.

    Comments:

         1) Why aren’t we being told, at least at a high level, of the results of other experiments
            (i.e., male and female mice, tissues other than heart and brain, tumors other than
            glioma and schwannoma)? Given the multiple comparisons inherent in this kind of work
            (see pages 27-30 and Table 13 of the FDA guidance document), there is a high risk of
            false positive discoveries. In the absence of knowing other findings, we must worry
            about selective reporting bias.
         2) I was able to reproduce the authors’ positive P-value findings (see Appendix 1, R code)
            using the MCPAN R package. However, I’m getting slightly different values for adjusted
            denominators (also in Appendix 1).
         3) I was able to reproduce the authors’ findings of longer survival with RFR (see Appendix
            1, R code).
         4) I have a number of questions about the study design:
                 a. Were control rats selected in utero like the exposed rats were?
                 b. Were pregnant dams assigned to different groups by formal randomization? If
                    not, why not?
                 c. Why were pups in the same litter included? Did the authors take any steps in
                    their analyses to account for the resulting absence of i.i.d?
                 d. The authors state that at most 3 pups were chosen per litter. How were the 3
                    pups chosen (and the others presumably not used for this experiment)? Were
                    the 3 pups that were chosen selected by formal randomization? If not, why not?




                                                                       36

                                                                                                        Lauer review of cell phone NTP report
                                                                                                                                 Page 2 of 14


               e. Were all analyses based on the intent-to-treat principle? Were there any
                  crossovers? Were all rats accounted for by the end of the experiment and were
                  all rats who started in the experiment included in the final analyses?
               f. Blinding: The authors state that “All PWG reviewer were conducted blinded with
                  respect to treatment group,” but in the very next phrase write “only identifying
                  the test articles as ‘test agent A’ or ‘test agent B.’” Why was this information
                  (test agent A or B) given? The blinding was not complete.
         5) Sample size:
               a. Did the authors perform a prospective (that is before initiation of the work)
                  sample size calculation? If so, what were the prior assumptions? In other words,
                  why did the authors choose to study 90 rats in each group and why did they set
                  the maximum duration to 90 weeks (instead of 104 weeks)?
               b. I used a publicly available simulation package1 to calculate the study power for
                  male rats based on the following (see Appendix 2, power calculation simulation
                  studies):
                         i. Control tumor rate of ~1.5%.
                        ii. Risk ratio 2.5 in the group receiving the highest dose
                      iii. 2-sided Alpha = 0.005 (based on Table 13 of the FDA guidance
                            document). Note this low alpha of 0.005 for poly-k trend tests is
                            recommended to minimize the risk of false positive discoveries.
                       iv. Sample size of 90 for each group with one planned sacrifice.
                        v. Low lethality with lethality parameters set according to study duration
                            and Weibull shape parameter (see Table 3 of Moon et al1). When I re-ran
                            the simulations using intermediate lethality, results were not materially
                            changed.
                       vi. Study duration 90 weeks
                      vii. 5000 simulations
                     viii. Note – I used dose levels of 0,1,2, and 4 because I was unable to adjust
                            these on the web site (despite trying 3 different browsers).
               c. Based on these inputs, the recommendations in Table 13 of the FDA guidance
                  document, and a sample size of 90 rats in each group, I find very low power
                  (<5%, see Appendix 2). Even allowing for a risk ratio of 5.0 (a level that is
                  clinically unlikely), the power for 2-sided alpha=0.005, k=3 and low lethality is
                  only ~14% (see Appendix 2).
               d. The low power implies that there is a high risk of false positive findings2,
                  especially since the epidemiological literature questions the purported
                  association between cell phone exposure and cancer.3
         6) Summary: I am unable to accept the authors’ conclusions:
               a. We need to know all other findings of these experiments (mice, other tumor
                  types) given the risk of false positive findings and reporting bias. It would be
                  helpful to have a copy of the authors’ statistical code.
               b. We need to know whether randomization was employed to assign dams to
                  specific groups (control and intervention).

                                                                                                                                 Page 3 of 14


                    c. We need to know whether randomization was employed to determine which
                       pups from each litter were chosen for continued participation in the experiment.
                    d. We need to know whether there was a formal power/sample size calculation
                       performed prior to initiation of the experiment. If not, why not? If yes, we need
                       to see the details. In particular, we need to know whether the authors followed
                       the recommendations of the FDA guidance document (in particular Table 13).
                    e. I suspect that this experiment is substantially underpowered and that the few
                       positive results found reflect false positive findings.2 The higher survival with
                       RFR, along with the prior epidemiological literature, leaves me even more
                       skeptical of the authors’ claims.

         I think the study was well	  designed and the analyses and results were clearly
         presented.

         My main concern is the control	  data.	   Since the main finding was the increased
         incidence rates of heart schwannomas and brain gliomas in male Harlan	  Spragu
         Dawley	  rats exposed to GSM-­‐	  or CDMA-­‐modulated	  cell phone RFR, my analyses and
         evaluation below were focused on the male rats.

         My	  concern regarding the	  control data came from the following two considerations.	  
         First, we need to consider sample variation. The incidence	  rates	  of the	  current
         controls	  for brain	  gliomas and heart	  schwannomas were 0.	   However,	  the historical	  
         controls	  were	  1.67% for gliomas (range	  0-­‐8%)	  and 1.30% for schwannomas (0-­‐6%).	  
         Given	  that there were substantial variations among the historical controls and the
         concurrent control is at the	  lowest end of the	  range,	  it is important to evaluate how
         different estimates of control incidence rates may impact the results of analyses.
         Supplementary Table S1 shows that for gliomas with 1.7%	  incidence	  rate we have
         40%, 37%, 17%, and	  6%	  of chance to observe 0 tumor, 1 tumor, 2 tumors, and
         greater than 2 tumors, respectively; heart schwannomas has similar distribution.
         Given the	  low incidence rate	  and moderate sample size of the	  control,	  even after	  
         observing	  0 tumor in the	  current study,	  the	  ‘true’	  incidence	  rate may be higher than
         0. If	  we	  were	  repeating the experiment, we may see some control studies	  have 1 or
         more tumors. Second, it is puzzling	  why the control	  had short survival rate. Given
         that most of the gliomas and heart schwannomas are late-­‐developing	  tumors,	  it is
         possible	  that if the controls were living longer	  some tumors might develop.	  
         Although the use of poly-­‐3	  (or poly-­‐6)	  test intended to adjust the number of rats
         used	  in the	  study,	  it is still	  important to re-­‐evaluate	  the	  analysis	  by	  considering the	  
         incidence rate	  in controls	  not being 0.

         Therefore I have	  performed the analyses using the original data as well as the data
         modified by adding 1 tumor to the control. I implemented the poly-­‐3	  (or poly-­‐6)
         trend test in R using the formula described in the file, Poly3	  correction	  
         factor[1].docx.

         Since the incidence of heart schwannomas in the 6 W/kg males was significantly	  
         higher in CDMA	  exposed males than the control group in the	  original report,	  I also

         Conclusions	  

         Increased incidence	  of heart schwannomas in male rats exposed to GSM-­‐	  or CDMA-­‐
         modulated RFR is statistically significant by	  the	  chi-­‐square	  trend	  test.	   The evidence
         is better for CDMA	  exposure than	  GSM	  exposure.	   I think additional	  experiments are
         needed to assess if the incidence	  of brain gliomas in male rats exposed to GSM-­‐ or
         CDMA-­‐modulated	  RFR is significantly higher than	  the control	  group or not.	  

         My additional comments are summarized below.

         1.         I compared poly-­‐3 adjusted number from Table 3 in the original repor
         versus the	  poly-­‐3	  adjusted number that I calculated using the raw data from the
         excel files.	   Supplementary	  Figure S1 shows that these two sets of numbers agre
         with each other	  in general.	   This is in contrast	  to the comparison for poly-­‐6	  adjusted	  
         number from Table 1 in the original report versus the poly-­‐6 adjusted number that I
         calculated	  using the	  raw	  data from the excel files (Supplementary Figure S2).	   In
         fact, the adjusted rat numbers from Table 1 and Table 3 of the original report look	  
         quite	  similar (Supplementary Figure S3). This suggests that	  the poly-­‐3	  adjusted	  
         number was used in the footnotes	  in both	  Table	  1 and	  Table	  3 in the	  original report.	  

         2.         I noted that in Table S2 the adjusted numbers in from.original.report and
         poly3 are	  identical	  at Dose	  0 and 1.5 for both CDMA and GSM	  as well	  as at Dose 3 for
         GSM but differ slightly	  in the	  other	  treatment	  doses for heart schwannomas.	   One
         possible	  cause	  of the difference	  is that the version	  of the raw	  data	  in the excel files
         differs from that used to generate the original report. The second possibility is typ
         in the	  footnote	  in Table	  3. I also	  generated Table	  S3 that has	  the poly-­‐6	  adjusted
         numbers for brain gliomas. The two sets of the poly-­‐6	  adjusted numbers are	  ver
         different.	  

         3.    There are	  a couple	  of errors in the	  footnote	  of Table	   in the	  original report.	  
         2/74.05	  (5%) should	  be	  2/74.05	  (2.7%). 3/78.67 (4%) should	  be	  3/78.67 (3.8%).

                      Overall, the information included in the report is presented in a comprehensive
               and accurate manner. Specifically, the experimental design and conditions are
               sufficiently documented and the choice of statistical approaches is explained; the results
               are well organized and necessary details are provided.
                        Nevertheless, a few additions could be suggested:
               (1) Appendix tables for all poly-k tests performed could be added. I believe this would
               enhance the presentation of the adjusted rates and the strength of the statistical
               evidence. As a possible example I prepared the below table using the R package MCPAN
               and its poly3test() function.

         b. Please comment on whether NTP’s scientific interpretations of the data are objective and
            reasonable. Please explain why or why not.

                      Appropriate statistical design and methods were applied in accord with the
               FDA/NTP guidelines for conducting long-term rodent carcinogenicity studies and
               analyses. The results and limiting issues were objectively discussed. The critical issue of
               shorter survival in the male control group was addressed with regard to the percentage
               of animals surviving to terminal sacrifice in historical control data (avg. 47%, range 24%
               to 72%) and the possible impact of the observed age of tumor occurrence on the
               statistical inference.
                      I believe detailed information about animal selection and randomization
               procedures should be given so that the potential for allocation bias could be judged.
               As shown in the figure below, the lower survival rate to terminal sacrifice (28%) in the
               male control is accompanied by the higher rate of moribund sacrifice (49%); in the male
               group exposed to CDMA with 6 W/kg, a higher rate of natural death was observed
               (46%).
                      It has been reported that insufficient randomization can lead to differences in
               survival rates. As an example, in a carcinogenicity study on aspartame it was suggested
               that lack of randomization to different rooms may have possibly been the cause of low
               survival rates (27%) in the control female group due to a high background infection rate
               (EFSA, 2006; Magnuson, B., Williams, G.M., 2008).




                                                                       59

   2. Please identify any information that should be added or deleted:


           A statement of the required statistical significance level should be added. FDA guidance
    suggests the use of significance levels of 0.025 and 0.005 for tests for positive trends in incidence
    rates of rare tumors and common tumors, respectively; for testing pairwise differences in tumor
    incidence the use of significance levels of 0.05 and 0.01 is recommended for rare and common
    tumors, respectively. If power calculations to determine the required sample size were performed,
    the results should also be included.


    3. The scientific evidence supports NTP’s conclusion(s) for the study findings:

               The NTP’s overall draft conclusion was as follows: “Under the conditions of these studies, the
               observed hyperplastic lesions and neoplasms outlined in this partial report are considered likely
               the result of exposures to test article A and test article B. The findings in the heart were
               statistically stronger than the findings in the brain.”

                      In my view, the results support the conclusion of likely carcinogenic effect of the
               RFR-exposure on Schwannoma heart lesions in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats.
                      Possible carcinogenic effects in the brain are marginal and are not sufficiently
               supported by statistical evidence in the male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats.
                      In the female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats very few lesions were observed in
               either site and statistical significance was not reached at all.




                                                                       60

       Analysis of National Toxicology Program (NTP) study evaluating risk in rat lifetime
       exposure to GSM or CDMA RFR.

       Notes:

       The NTP study document acknowledges several study limitations [page 10, discussion
       section]. Potential limitations should prominently factor into considerations regarding
       the context of the findings, as well as their interpretation and application.

       Working list of limitations potentially impacting NTP study interpretations
             • Difficulty in achieving diagnostic consensus in lesions classifications of rare,
             unusual, and incompletely understood lesion association
             • Document appears to indicate that the second Pathology Working Group
             (PWG) empaneled to review and obtain lesion classification consensus,
             following the inability of the initial PWG to do so, may have reviewed different
             lesions sets
             • No record of clinical disease manifestations due to lesions involving heart and
             brain [note lesions in heart and brain are mutually exclusive; affected rats have
             either one or the other and do not appear to have the involvement of both
             organs together (appendix E)]
             • Lesions, including malignancies, do not appear to materially shorten lifespan,
             except for a subgroup of rats (less than 1/3 of affected rats) with malignant
             Schwannomas in heart
             • Lack of shortened lifespan as a consequence of malignancy for the majority of
             affected rats contrasts with shortened lifespan of male control rats for which
             there is absence of attributable cause of death. The survival of the control
             group of male rats in the current study (28%) was relatively low compared to
             other recent NTP studies (avg 47%, range 24 to 72%).
                     Creates greater reliance on statistical controlling for survival disparities
                     and reliance on historical controls
             • Reliance on historical controls made up of rats of different genetic strain
             background, held under different environmental conditions
             • Absence of data on incidence of more frequently expected tumor occurrences
             in rats (background lesions)

       Documenting the nature of the brain and cardiac lesions observed in RFR exposed
       rats and placing them into test article exposure-related context, in contrast to potential
       for their occurring spontaneously, are important and challenging goals. The NTP
       study limitations make the interpretation of reasonable risk more complicated. NTP
       acknowledgements of study limitations appear factored into one of NTP’s reviewer’s
       study conclusion, i.e., findings represent “some evidence” for a test article effect in
       statistically significant trend for Schwannomas; an opinion which is coupled with a
       conclusion for “equivocal evidence” of an effect in relation to malignant gliomas of the
       brain [NTP Appendix F, Reviewer Comments].

       The summation from Appendix F reviewers regarding existence of test article effect is
       less than conclusive. The NTP study documents a series of cytoproliferative changes


                                                                       62

       in heart and brain. The nature of some of the changes is challenging diagnostically
       and appears to be incompletely understood. These findings are presented in the
       absence of complete analysis of the entire consequences of the study effects. For
       example, no potential significance for test article effect context is given to any of
       granular cell proliferative lesions of the brain, a finding mentioned only as a contrast to
       what was less well understood pathologically (NTP Appendix C, Pathology). It is
       noteworthy that the lesion types analyzed in the NTP RFR study under review are
       uncommon historically in rats, in the organs discussed. Furthermore, the malignancies
       of neuroglia appear to be paired with the occurrence of poorly understood changes
       involving neuroglial cell hyperplasias in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
       Little information can be gleaned from the literature about the nature and significance
       of these latter proliferative changes, interpreted by NTP as nonneoplastic and non-
       inflammation-reactive neuroglial cell in nature. Although unclear in the NTP study
       document, it is plausible that the particular lesion constellation, along with the relative
       novelty of some lesions, contributed to the lack of consensus regarding the nature of
       the lesions on the part of the initial PWG study pathologists. Concern raised by one of
       the reviewers (Appendix F, Reviewer Comments) regarding how this difficulty in ability
       to classify lesions might impact comparisons to historical control lesion incidence data
       (NTP Table D) is certainly principled.

       The extraordinary PWG process, presumably posed by the difficult diagnostic
       interpretations, has the potential to influence the reliance on historical controls. In this
       regard, study limitations concerning determination of whether or not there is a test
       article effect include the substantially poor survival of male rats in the control group.
       The survival of the control group of male rats in the study under review (28%) was
       relatively low compared to other recent NTP studies (avg 47%, range 24 to 72%). This
       apparently led to greater statistical construction to account for the impact of study
       matched controls, and created increased reliance upon historical data of rare tumor
       incidences in control animals taken from other chronic carcinogenicity studies. NTP
       acknowledges a limitation in using the historical incident data and a small study match
       control group due to poor survivability. There are potential sources of variability when
       using historical controls of different rat strains and fluctuating study conditions
       (environment, vehicle, route of exposure, etc.), as is the case here. It seems less
       than clear what appropriate background lesion incidence is, as NTP indicates some
       data involve other strains of rats. The range of lesion incidence in historical controls
       could mean that the true incidence of some lesions varies considerably and might be
       considered rare or more common depending upon the incidence rate.

       The guidance manual on Statistical Aspects of the Design, Analysis and Interpretation
       of Chronic Rodent Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals by the FDA provided
       for this review discusses applying comparisons using historical control lesion
       incidences at some length [beginning page 27, line 996]. Considering lesions as being
       rare or more common appears to influence selection of the level of statistical
       significance for comparisons. It appears that analysis for significant differences in
       tumor incidence between the control and the dose groups for these NTP studies has
       been established at the 0.05 level (NTP Tables 1,3,5). Interpretations of trend tests
       may be influenced by the choice of decision rule applied. Such choices can result in


                                                                       63

       about twice as large overall false positive error as that associated with control-high
       pairwise comparison tests [page 28, line 1012-1026]. The FDA guidance manual
       [page 31, line 1136] highlights concern regarding reliance upon historical control
       incidence data, stating that using historical control data in the interpretation of
       statistical test results is not very satisfactory because the range of historical control
       rates is usually too wide. This is especially true in situations in which the historical
       tumor rates of most studies used are clustered together, but a few other studies give
       rates far away from the cluster. When the range of historical control data is simply
       calculated as the difference between the maximum and the minimum of the historical
       control rates, the range does not consider the shape of the distribution of the rates.
       These circumstances may impose some limitations on optimal risk assessment
       designs.

       Somewhat paradoxically then, NTP study limitations including that imposed due to
       reliance upon less than optimal historical control lesion incidence data for much of the
       comparisons between treated and untreated rats, is confronted by existence of a
       difficult to classify and incompletely understood lesion constellation interpreted to
       include neuroglial cell hyperplasia. Notwithstanding, this confounding proliferative
       lesion occurring in the context along with malignancies of apparently similar
       histogeneses, sustains a level of concern for a rare injury mechanism related to test
       article effect. Additional information about the study together with an assessment of
       the statistical analyses may enhance the value of this analysis.

    NTP Responses to Pathology	  Reviewer' Comments                                           April 12, 2016

    Reviewers:	  R. Mark Simpson,	  D.V.M.,	  Ph.D. and Diana	  Copeland Haines, D.V.M.

    Responses Relating	  to	  the Pathology Review Process

          Drafts of	  the PWG reports are provided. As described	  in	  the PWG report, the specific	  task of the
          first PWG (January 29th 2016) was to: 1) confirm the presence	  of glial cell hyperplasia	  and malignant
          gliomas in the brain and Schwann cell hyperplasia and	  schwannomas in the heart;	  2) develop	  
          specific	  diagnostic	  criteria in the brain for	  distinguishing glial cell hyperplasia from malignant	  glioma
          and gliosis,	  and in the heart for distinguishing between	  Schwann cell hyperplasia	  and schwannoma.	  
          The PWG participants confirmed the malignant gliomas and schwannomas,	  but the criteria for
          distinguishing between	  hyperplasia and	  neoplasia differed	  between	  the participants.

          In order to clearly establish specific diagnostic criteria for the differentiation between hyperplastic
          and neoplastic lesions in	  the brain	  and	  heart, two	  additional PWGs were	  convened. The participants
          for	  the second (February 25,	  2016)	  and third (March 3, 2016) PWGs were selected based on their
          distinguished	  expertise in the fields of	  neuropathology and cardiovascular pathology, respectively.
          Some	  of the	  participants were leaders in the International Harmonization of	  Nomenclature and
          Diagnostic Criteria initiative.	   The neuropathology experts of the second PWG confirmed the
          malignant gliomas in the brain, established diagnostic criteria for glial cell hyperplasia, and	  agreed	  
          that	  the hyperplastic lesions are	  within a continuum leading to malignant glioma. The
          cardiovascular pathology	  experts	  of the third PWG established specific diagnostic criteria for
          Schwann cell hyperplasia and	  schwannoma in	  the endocardium and	  myocardium,	  and reviewed and
          confirmed all	  cases of Schwann cell	  hyperplasia and schwannoma observed	  in these studies. The
          outcome of the PWG provided	   very high degree	  of confidence	  in the	  diagnoses.

          The participants of the first PWG (January 29th 2016) only reviewed a subset of the glial lesions that
          were observed in the studies. The review	  for the second PWG (February 25, 2016)	  included all glial
          lesions in the studies including the subset that	  was reviewed in the first PWG.

    Responses Relating	  to	  Considerations of Historical Control Data

          For NTP	  toxicology and carcinogenicity studies, the concurrent controls are always the primary
          comparison group. However, historical control information is	  useful particularly	  in instances	  when
          there is differential survival between controls and exposed groups, as was observed	  in the RFR
          studies. Rates for glial cell neoplasms and	  heart schwannomas from control groups of male Harlan	  
          Sprague	  Dawley rats from other recently completed NTP studies are	  presented in Appendix D of the	  
          3-­‐16-­‐2016	  draft report.	  While Harlan Sprague Dawley rats are an outbred strain,	  they are	  considered
             single	  genetic strain in the	  same	  sense	  as other outbred strains, such as the	  Long-­‐Evans or Wistar
          rat.	   Therefore, these historical control tumor	  rates are applicable to this study. However, it’s
          important to note that the studies listed in Appendix D were carried out at laboratories other than
          the RFR studies, and under	  different	  housing and environmental conditions. At the time of the 3-­‐16-­‐
          201 draft report,	  not all of these studies had	  undergone a complete pathology peer review. In the
          past several weeks NTP pathologists have reviewed	  brain	  and	  heart slides from these male rat
          control groups, and have confirmed, with few exceptions, the low rates	  of hyperplastic	  and
          neoplastic lesions reported	  in	  Appendix D, applying the diagnostic	  criteria established during the
          PWGs outlined in Appendix C.

    NTP Comments on Statistical Issues	  Raised by	  the Reviewers                                         April 12,	  2016

    Given the multiple comparisons inherent in this kind of work, there is a high risk of false positive
    discoveries (Michael S. Lauer).

          Although	  the NTP conducts statistical tests on multiple cancer endpoints in any given study,	  
          numerous authors have shown that the study-­‐wide false positive rate does not greatly exceed	  0.05
          (Fears et	  al., 1977; Haseman, 1983; Office of	  Science and Technology Policy, 1985; Haseman, 1990;
          Haseman	  and	  Elwell, 1996; Lin	  and	  Rahman, 1998; Rahman	  and	  Lin, 2008; Kissling et al., 2014). One
          reason for	  this is that	  NTP’s carcinogenicity	  decisions are	  not based solely on statistics and in many
          instances statistically significant findings are not concluded to be	  due	  to the	  test agent. Many factors
          go into this determination including whether there were pre-­‐neoplastic lesions, whether there was a
          dose-­‐response relationship, biological plausibility,	  background rates and variability of the tumor, etc.	  
          Additionally, with rare tumors especially, the actual	  false positive rate of each individual	  test	  is well
          below 0.05, due to	  the discrete nature of the data, so	  the cumulative false positive rate from many
          such tests	  is	  less than person would expect by multiplying 0.05 by the number of tests conducted
          (Fears et	  al., 1977; Haseman, 1983; Kissling et	  al., 2015).

    I’m getting slightly different values for poly-­‐k	  adjusted denominators (Michael S. Lauer).

    I compared poly-­‐-­‐-­‐3 adjusted number from Table 3 in the original report versus the poly-­‐-­‐-­‐3 adjusted
    number that I calculated using the raw data from the excel files. Supplementary Figure S1 shows that
    these two sets of numbers agree with each other in general. This is in contrast to the comparison for poly-­‐
    -­‐-­‐6 adjusted number from Table 1 in the original report versus the poly-­‐-­‐-­‐6 adjusted number that I
    calculated using the raw data from the excel files (Supplementary Figure S2). In fact, the adjusted rat
    numbers from Table 1 and Table 3 of the original report look quite similar (Supplementary Figure S3).
    This suggests that the poly-­‐-­‐-­‐3 adjusted number was used in the footnotes in both Table 1 and Table 3 in
    the original report. (Max Lee)

    I noted that in Table S2 the adjusted numbers in from.original.report and poly3 are identical at Dose 0
    and 1.5 for both CDMA and GSM as well as at Dose 3 for GSM but differ slightly in the other treatment
    doses for heart schwannomas. One possible cause of the difference is that the version of the raw data in
    the excel files differs from that used to generate the original report. The second possibility is typo in the
    footnote in Table 3. I also generated Table S3 that has the poly-­‐-­‐-­‐6 adjusted numbers for brain gliomas.
    The two sets of the poly-­‐-­‐-­‐6 adjusted numbers are very different. (Max Lee)

    Information could be included regarding the software or programming environment used for the
    computations. (Aleksandra M. Michalowski)

          The adjusted denominators in Table of the original report were labeled as poly-­‐6	  denominators,
          but were actually poly-­‐3	  denominators. This error was noted and brought to Dr Tabak’s attention by
          Dr. Bucher in a March 22 email.

          The p-­‐values and adjusted denominators calculated by	  NTP are correct, except as noted for Table 1,
          and were	  calculated using validated poly-­‐k	  software.	   This software is coded in Java and is
          embedded within NTP’s TDMSE (Toxicology Data	  Management System Enterprise) system.	   Poly-­‐k

                                                                       67

          calculations conducted by	  the reviewers in R may vary slightly from the NTP’s calculation due to	  
          selection of study length and the NTP’s use of the Bieler-­‐Williams variance adjustment and a
          continuity	  correction. In his calculations, Dr. Lauer used	  90 weeks as the study length, whereas the
          actual study length was 10 weeks. It	  is not	  apparent from the	  R documentation that the Bieler-­‐
          Williams adjustment or the continuity correction is incorporated into the poly-­‐3	  calculations in R. In
          his calculations, Dr. Lee used	  two-­‐sided p-­‐values. In NTP statistical tests for carcinogenicity, the
          expectation is that if the test article is carcinogenic, tumor rates should	  increase with	  increasing
          exposure; thus, the	  NTP	  employs one-­‐sided tests	  and p-­‐values are one-­‐sided. Using one-­‐sided p-­‐
          values in Dr. Lee’s Table 1, the GSM trend if there were brain glioma	  in the	  control group remains
          nonsignificant, but the CDMA	  trend	  approaches 0.05 (p	  = 0.054) if there were brain glioma	  in the	  
          control group. In Dr. Lee’s	  Table 2, the one-­‐sided p-­‐value for the GSM trend if there were 1 heart
          schwannoma in the control group approaches 0.05 (p	  = 0.054) and	  the one-­‐sided p-­‐value for the
          CDMA	  trend	  in	  heart schwannomas remains significant at = 0.018 if there were 1 heart
          schwannoma in the control group.	  In Dr. Lee’s Table 3, the one-­‐sided p-­‐value for the CDMA pairwise
          comparison is significant at p = 0.049 if there were 1 heart schwannoma in the control	  group.

      statement of the required statistical significance level should be added. FDA	  guidance suggests the use
    of significance levels of 0.025 an 0.005 for tests for positive trends in incidence rates of	  rare tumors and
    common tumors, respectively; for testing pairwise differences	  in tumor incidence the use of significance
    levels of 0.05 and 0.01 is recommended for rare and common tumors, respectively. (Aleksandra M.
    Michalowski)

          Although	  the FDA	  guidance suggests lowering the significance level for most tests of trend	  and	  
          pairwise differences, this guidance is based	  o a misunderstanding of findings reported	  by Haseman	  
          (1983). In this paper, Haseman discusses several rules proposed	  by others for setting the
          significance level lower than 0.05. If these rules are rigidly followed, Haseman showed that	  study
          conclusions	  will be consistent with the NTP’s	  more complex decision-­‐making process, for	  which 0.05
          is the nominal significance level and p-­‐values are taken into consideration along	  with other factors
          (outlined	  above in	  response to	  comment 1) in determining whether the tumor increase is
          biologically significant. The NTP does not strictly adhere to	   specific statistical significance	  level in
          determining whether a carcinogenic effect is present.

    Appendix tables for all poly-­‐k	  tests performed could be	  added. (Aleksandra M. Michalowski)

          Dr. Michalowski proposed a sample table. The rows corresponding to X, N, adjusted n are	  already
          included in the tables or	  appear the footnotes in the tables.	   The rows corresponding to “Dunnett
          contrast” and “Williams	  contrast” are not appropriate for dichotomous	  tumor data. Both Dunnett’s	  
          test	  and Williams’ test	  assume that	  the data are continuous and	  normally distributed.

    In the portion of the text describing poly-­‐k	  test results, p-­‐values are	  given for significant pairwise	  
    comparisons; I would also give the p-­‐values estimated for the	  significant trends. (Aleksandra M.
    Michalowski)

          Indicators of significant trends are given in the tables in the form of asterisks next to control	  group
          tumor	  counts.

    There are a couple of errors in the footnote of Table 3 in the original report. 2/74.05 (5%) should be
    2/74.05 (2.7%). 3/78.67 (4%) should be 3/78.67 (3.8%). (Max Lee)

          Thank you for pointing this out. The percentages will be corrected in our final report.

    Were control rats selected in utero like the exposed rats were? Were pregnant dams assigned to
    different groups by formal randomization?	  How were the pups per litter chosen?	  (Michael S. Lauer).

     believe detailed information about animal	  selection and randomization procedures should be given so
    that	  the potential for	  allocation bias could be judged. (Aleksandra M. Michalowski)

          Pregnant dams were assigned	  to	  groups, including the control group, using formal randomization	  
          that	  sought	  to also equalize mean body weights across groups. The three pups per sex per litter
          were selected using formal randomization, as well. Tumors in the heart and	  brain	  were not
          observed	  in	  littermates, indicating	  that there	  was no litter-­‐based	  bias in	  the results.

    Were all analyses based on the intent-­‐to-­‐treat	  principle? Were there any crossovers? Were all rats
    accounted	  for by the end	  of the experiment an were all rats who	  started	  in	  the experiment included	  in	  
    the final analyses? (Michael S. Lauer)

          The intent-­‐to-­‐treat	  principle is not	  relevant	  to this animal experiment, in which all animals that	  were
          assigned to treatment group received the	  full and equal treatment	  of	  that	  group. There were no
          crossovers. All animals	  that started the experiment were accounted for by	  the end of the
          experiment and included in the	  final analyses.

    The PWG review blinding was not complete. (Michael S. Lauer)

          PWG reviewers were blinded to the identity of the test article and the level	  of exposure but were
          not blinded	  to	  the fact	  that	  there were two different,	  yet related, test	  articles (modulations of cell
          phone RFR),	  to emphasize the fact that there was a common control group.

    Did the authors perform a prospective sample size calculation? (Michael S. Lauer)

    If power calculations to determine the required sample size were performed, the results should also be
    included.	   (Aleksandra M.	  Michalowski)

          Sample	  size	  calculations were conducted for this	  study. However, for detecting carcinogenesis,
          sample size and power will depend on the baseline (control) tumor rate and the expected
          magnitude of the increase in tumors. For example, at 80% power, sample size requirements will be
          quite different for detecting a 2-­‐fold increase in a rare tumor	  having a spontaneous occurrence of	  
          0.5% compared to 2-­‐fold increase in a more common tumor	  having a spontaneous occurrence of	  
          10%. Because	  many different tumor types having wide	  range	  of spontaneous occurrence are
          involved in these studies, there is no “one-­‐size-­‐fits-­‐all” sample	  size; rather, the	  sample	  size	  is a


                                                                                                                                           3	  
                                                                       69

          compromise among several factors, including obtaining reasonable power to detect moderate to
          large increases for most tumor types,	  while staying within budgets of time,	  space,	  and funding. A
          sample of 90 animals	  per sex per group was	  selected as	  providing as	  much statistical power as	  
          possible across the spectrum of tumors, under the constraints imposed	  by the exposure system.

          The NTP’s carcinogenicity studies are	  similar in structure	  to the	  OECD’s 45 Guideline	  for
          carcinogenicity	  studies and the	  FDA’s guidance	  for rodent carcinogenicity studies of
          pharmaceuticals.	   These guidelines recommend at least 50 animals of each sex per group,	  but also
          mention that an increase in group size provides relatively little increase in statistical power. In the
          NTP’s RFR	  studies, the group	  sizes were 90 animals of each	  sex per group, nearly twice as many as
          the minimum recommendation.	   Increasing the	  group sizes further provides diminishing returns, for
          which additional animals do not substantially increase power.

    The low power implies that there is high	  risk of false positive findings (citing	  Ioannidis, 2005). …
     suspect that this experiment is substantially underpowered and that the few positive results	  found
    reflect	  false positive findings (citing Ioannidis, 2005). (Michael S. Lauer)

          It is true that the power is low for detecting moderate increases above a low background tumor rate
          of approximately – %,	  as was seen in the brain and heart tumors.	   However, this low power does
          not correspond to high	  risk of false positive findings. The paper by Ioannidis that was cited	  
          correctly	  states	  that when studies are small or effect sizes are small (i.e., statistical power	  is low),
          “the less likely	  the research findings are to be true.”	   Research findings can be “not true”	  if the result
          is a false positive or a false negative.	   With low statistical	  power, false negatives are much more
          likely than false positives. Therefore, the vast majority of false research findings in a low power	  
          situation will result	  from the failure to detect	  an	  effect when it exists. The false positive rate on any
          properly constructed statistical test will not exceed its significance level, alpha.	   By definition, the
          significance level of a statistical test is its false positive rate, and it is typically selected by the
          researcher, often at	  a low fixed value such as 0.05	  or 5%.

    If we were repeating the experiment, we may see some control studies have 1 or more tumors. (Max Lee)
    (Dr. Lee also presented analyses of the male rat data, inserting hypothetical data on one tumor-­‐bearing	  
    animal in	  the control group.)

          In light of the historical	  control	  data, Dr. Lee demonstrated that several associations became	  less or
          not significant with	  the insertion	  of a tumor data point in	  the control group.	  While we appreciate
          that	  some other	  studies had one or	  more tumors, the NTP considers the concurrent	  control group as
          the most	  important	  comparator	  to the treated groups. We	  took the historical control tumor	  rates
          into account in a more subjective manner in our interpretation of the findings. In 2010, we asked to
          adopt more	  formal method of incorporating historical control data in	  our statistical	  testing, but
          our Board	  of Scientific Counselors voted	  against adopting the method.

    It is puzzling why the control	  had short survival	  rate. Given that most of the gliomas and heart

    used	  in	  the study, it is still important to	  re-­‐evaluate	  the	  analysis by	  considering the	  incidence	  rate	  in
    controls	  not being 0.	  (Max Lee)

          We do not know why the male rat control group had a low survival rate. We generally d observe
          lower survival	  rates in studies such as	  the RFR studies	  in which animals are singly-­‐ rather	  than group
          housed. While some tumors	  might possibly have arisen in controls if	  they lived longer, it	  was
          notable that n glial cell or Schwann	  cell hyperplasias were found	  in	  these animals as well.

          The poly-­‐k (e.g., poly-­‐3	  or poly-­‐6) test was developed to adjust for the fact that not all animals
          survive to the end of a two-­‐year study, and survival rates may	  differ among	  groups. The test is
          essentially Cochran-­‐Armitage trend	  test in	  which	  the denominator of the tumor rate in	  each	  group	  
          is adjusted downward to better reflect the number of animal-­‐years at risk	  during	  the study. Each
          animal that develops the	  tumor or survives to the	  end of the	  study is counted as one	  animal. Each
          animal that does not develop the	  tumor and dies (or is moribund sacrificed) before	  the	  end of the	  
          study is counted as a fractional	  animal.	   The fraction is calculated as the proportion of the study that
          it survived, raised to the k-­‐th power; = 3 or = 6 in this study. The survival-­‐adjusted tumor rate	  in
          each group is then the	  number of animals having	  the	  tumor	  of	  interest	  divided by the total count	  of	  
          animals at risk of developing the	  tumor in the group. These survival-­‐adjusted rates are	  used in the	  
          Cochran-­‐Armitage formula to	  provide the poly-­‐k	  test for dose-­‐related trends and pairwise
          comparisons	  with the control group.

          The poly-­‐k	  test has been shown to yield valid inferences about tumor rates in NTP two-­‐year rat and
          mouse carcinogenicity studies (Bailer and Portier, 1988; Portier and Bailer, 1989; Portier et al.,
          1986). Its theoretical basis is that tumor incidence, while not directly observed unless the tumor is
          immediately lethal, follows a Weibull	  distribution with a shape parameter, k.	   Verification using NTP
          studies	  has	  shown that if k is	  between 1 and 5, setting k = 3 yields	  a valid statistical test (Portier and
          Bailer, 1989; Portier et al, 1986). Thus, most of the time, the NTP uses the poly-­‐3	  test. If tumor
          type is late-­‐occurring, as we observed	  with	  the brain	  gliomas, k = 6 is a better fit to	  the data and	  the
          poly-­‐6	  test has	  more validity.

    In the portion of the text describing differences in survival	  at the end of the study between control	  and
    RFR-­‐exposed animals the	  compared characteristic is not named an also	  n numerical values of the
    estimates or the	  range	  of differences are	  given. I would	  ad numbers in	  the text of a Appendix table
    showing the group survival estimates	  described in this	  paragraph. (Aleksandra M. Michalowski)

          The Statistical Methods section describes the method for comparing survival distributions between
          the control and	  RFR-­‐exposed groups, namely, Tarone’s (1975) life	  table	  test to identify exposure-­‐
          related trends in survival and Cox’s (1972)	  method for	  testing two groups for	  equality of	  survival
          distributions.

    ADDITIONAL	  RESPONSE:

    Dear All,

    Thanks again for all your helpful comments on the NTP	  RFR studies. I did want to follow up on
    one remaining point of disagreement that Mike Lauer alluded to in his comments about low
    powered studies. Although we agree that our study design had low power to detect statistically
    significant neoplastic effects in the brain and heart, which occurred with both RFR modulations
    in male rats, we disagree over the assertion that low power in and of itself, creates false
    positive results. We cited a handful of publications outlining the statistical arguments against
    this with specific respect to the NTP	  rodent cancer study design in our response to comments
    document sent earlier. Although Mike referred to the example of positive findings in
    underpowered	  epidemiology studies that could not be replicated in larger follow up studies,
    there is a growing literature alluding to this problem with respect to experimental animal
    studies as well. An example is a relatively recent article by one of our collaborators in
    CAMARADES, Malcolm MacLeod.

    http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110928/full/477511a.html

    It’s	  important to distinguish between low power to detect effects, and the constellation of
    other factors that often accompany low powered experimental animal studies in contributing
    to this problem. We’ve	  addressed this issue in a recent editorial, and these factors are captured
    in our published systematic review process for evaluating study quality in environmental	  health
    sciences (Rooney et al., 2014).

    http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-­‐content/uploads/122/7/ehp.1408671.pdf


    http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-­‐content/uploads/122/7/ehp.1307972.pdf

    Table 1 in the Rooney et al. report outlines risk of bias considerations that commonly plague
    studies carried out by academic researchers that are accounted for in NTP	  studies.

    I provide these examples to assure you that we are completely cognizant of these issues and
    take them very seriously. Again, we appreciate the help you’ve	  provided in assuring that we
    appropriately interpret and communicate our findings.

    Best

I am writing to express my support for the Affordable Housing Overlay as written, as this will make it possible
to develop the affordable housing our city so badly needs. The proposed amendments re distance from
transit, amount of parking, height, and low income eligibility levels may meet the interests of some in the city
but will cause delay and diminishment in what could be a major breakthrough in Palo Alto's housing impasse.

Palo Alto can not afford to remain stuck in a mindset of being a small town but must face the reality and
demands of the current housing‐jobs crunch. The Affordable Housing Overlay is a significant effort towards
this goal and I urge the PTC to refer the ordnance as written to the City Council for their consideration and
action under guidelines of the Comprehensive Plan.

Dear Mayor Kniss, Palo Alto City Council, Jonathan Lait, Hillary Gitelman, and City Manager James Keene

I am writing to voice my opposition to the Community Center designation for the Baptist Church, 305 N California Ave.,
Palo Alto.

The church is essentially operating as a “for profit” commercial building in Old Palo Alto. On Sundays, the church has
less than 30 parishioners attending services.

Out of curiosity, I googled 305 N California Ave (the address of the church) and found 44 organizations and groups that
are currently or have recently operated out of the church on a weekly or multi weekly basis. Below is a list of the
groups. I believe this list is only the tip of the iceberg of the multitude of activities at the church.

>>>>>>>>>>>> Body
       ISing
>>>>>>>>>>>> Mosaic South Bay

The church has so many non‐church related activities that it has removed the pews from the chapel to essentially make
it a multipurpose room.
Also, no church staff member or private security person is at the church during evening events. The church is
unattended.

The church parking lot only has 5 parking spaces. The PA Planning Dept told a neighbor that the church sold off its
parking lot many years ago. As a result, the church inconveniences the neighbors and creates hazardous conditions with
cars double parked in the Bryant Street Bike Boulevard lane, cars that are idling, and cars blocking homeowners
driveways.

If the church became a community center, especially with functions until 11 pm on weekends, who would monitor the
activities? Who could neighbors call for noise infractions late at night? No city staff employee is available after 5 pm.

I urge the City Council to deny the CUP request. Thank you.

Debbie Nichols
Resident, Old Palo Alto

Letter to City Council: Bicycle and Pedestrian Improvements.
March 12, 2018

Dear Council Members:

The comprehensive plan states: “The key to a sustainable transportation system
lies in providing more options and more convenience so that people will more
readily choose not to drive.” Bicycle and pedestrian improvements are about as
sustainable as one can get.

With rising construction costs and new unbudgeted projects there is financial
pressure to cut or delay implementation of projects.

In the echo chamber of social media, the Ross Road Bicycle Boulevard changes
are being heavily criticized before they are even completed.

The changes on Ross Road are more extensive than those on Bryant. Some of
this is due to efforts to improve pedestrian safety. However, some is due to the
direction by city council to not use diversions which were the key element on
Bryant. Diversions are harder to implement in areas of the city that have few
parallel streets and may not have been appropriate for Ross. However, to
reduce costs for future Bike Boulevard projects, Council should lift this
prohibition.

I understand there is now a petition to
stop the roundabouts with the claim
that they are unsafe. That is not the
situation elsewhere. Seattle has
installed over 1000 mini-roundabouts
or traffic circles in the last 30 years
and has seen a crash reduction of more
than 70%. To the right is statistics
from the FHWA. From Palo Alto’s
Comprehensive Plan: “Traffic circles
have been shown to reduce collisions
and are considered more bicycle-
friendly than traditional two- or four-
way stops controls.”

Bryant was contentious when it was built, but has proven to be highly
successful. On Bryant, bicyclists typically ride in a straight line to the left of
parked cars. Cars, pass on the left as they would another car. It’s a safe and
1 of 2                   20180312_Letter to City Council
low stress situation for both bicyclists and drivers. While change is hard, I’m
hopeful that in a year or so. the users of Ross Road will adopt similar habits.

Another critical bike and pedestrian project is the Charleston/Arastradero
corridor which was passed unanimously by council. It also has driver safety
implications, especially to the neighborhoods south of Charleston. This project
has been in development for well over a decade and should be implemented.

Please continue implementation of the 2012 Bicycle and Pedestrian
Transportation Plan.

Sincerely,

Eric Nordman

Subject:                           Bike Projects Funding


Dear city councel,

My name is Arnout Boelens and my wife and I have been living in Palo Alto for slightly over a year. I commute daily from
Midtown to Stanford University by bike and my wife from Midtown to Downtown Palo Alto.

First of all I would like to thank you for your work to make Palo Alto a great biking city. My wife and I actually do not own
a car and only use our bikes to get around. Whenever I do drive around in a car I realize that thanks to the bike
boulevards biking is the quickest and least stressful way to get around town. Of course the weather helps too.

To get even more people on bikes and reduce traffic congestion I think it is essential that the Palo Alto moves forward
with the bike projects on Amarillo Avenue, Bryant Street, East Meadow Drive, Montrose Avenue, Moreno Avenue, Louis
Road, Palo Alto Avenue, and Ross Road. I feel especially a good connection to the new Highway 101 over crossing is
important for people visiting the Baylands and people commuting to Google, Intuit, and many more companies by bike.
If people do not feel safe during part of their commute because there are no traffic calming measures they might rather
go by car, adding to to already bad rush hour traffic. Also the connection of the Bryant bike boulevard to Mountain View
is currently a clear gap in the coverage of the cycling network and would help many commuters.

I hope that despite the gap in funding for infrastructure projects the city council will continue its commitment to keep
Palo Alto a gold level Bicycle Friendly Community. Last but not least because investment in bike infrastructure is so much
more cost efficient than spending on car infrastructure.

Kind regards,

Arnout Boelens

To whom it may concern:
  I would like to voice my support for continuous improvement to the bicycle infrastructure in Palo Alto. I use
my bicycle to commute to work in Palo Alto and have been for three years. I appreciate being able to use
bicycle friendly roads and reduce overall congestion. Please continue to keep bicycle transportation in mind on
road projects. Thank you very much.

Subject:                      Calling your attention to a conflict of interest



Dear Mayor Kniss, Vice-Mayor Filseth and Members of City Council:



I am writing to more formally bring to your attention something I believe you will be as troubled by as I
am, and it is this: When a local property owner called the City because he was concerned about the
level of radiation being emitted by a cell phone tower adjacent to his property, the City hired Verizon’s
engineering firm—the same firm Verizon has hired to persuade residents they have nothing to be
concerned about when it comes to cell tower radiation—to conduct what was supposed to be an
“independent” evaluation of whether the cell tower was in compliance with FCC guidelines.



Here’s what occurred: In April of last year, the owner of the office building at 635 Bryant Street in
Palo Alto contacted the City because he was concerned about the level of radiation being emitted by
a nearby Verizon/Crown Castle cell tower. Specifically, he wrote to the Planning Department to
request that the City obtain an “independent” (I am quoting from his email to the City) evaluation of
radiation levels at the site. The Planning Department agreed to do so, and the work was carried out
in May. But instead of getting an independent evaluation, the Planning Department hired Hammett &
Edison—the same firm to whom Verizon is paying millions of dollars to support its applications to
install over 100 new cell towers in Palo Alto. (By the way, Crown Castle is also a Hammett & Edison
client.)


Of course I’m not qualified to evaluate Hammett & Edison’s work. But what I do know is that
Hammett & Edison had a massive conflict of interest in accepting this project, and one has to
question the ethics of a company that would accept such an assignment. In addition, one also has to
question the judgment of Hillary Gitelman and her staff, who commissioned Hammett & Edison to do
the job.



I realize that Hammett & Edison has government clients and, in particular, it has, I believe, worked for
Palo Alto in the past. But there is no gray area here: Hammett & Edison is being well paid by
Verizon—as it was in May, 2017—to support Verizon’s applications to install dozens and dozens of
cell towers here. Moreover, its mission for Verizon includes assuaging any concerns Palo Altans may
have that cell towers represent a health risk. How could the City possibly justify hiring this firm to look
into whether any cell tower is emitting more radiation than the FCC permits?


                                                         1
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 3/12/2018 3:57 PM
I know you, as individuals, care a great deal about our city and its residents. I trust that you will be as
appalled as I was to learn that a standard bearer for the telecom industry was hired to determine
whether a Verizon cell tower is in compliance with FCC radiation standards.



Sincerely,



Jyotsna Nimkar

enrollment to 415 but gave them a 1-year
exemption in 2015 to keep enrollment at
438 as they explored the possibility of a

the school that the entrance/exit on
Embarcadero was not feasible, they failed
to re-enforce the 415 statute.

Subject:                        Cell Towers in Residential Neighborhoods



Please reject the request by Verizon to allow cell towers in residential neighborhoods. People currently aren't
complaining that they can't get adequate wireless phone service from their homes, and the intrusion of an
industrial product (which is what the cell tower equipment is) in residential areas is unnecessary and intrusive.
If there is any expansion of the cell system any and all electrical equipment should be buried underground, not
sitting on sidewalks and curbs. Verizon has admitted hat the towers aren't needed to serve homes in the areas,
but will be mainly for visitors who are using cell phones locally. That attitude puts transients over residents,
and it is the city's responsibility to prioritize protecting residents, not commercial interests..

Yours very sincerely,

Bob Moss

March 12, 2018

TO: Architectural Review Board

I am sending this email out of my concern for Verizon’s plans to locate cell towers in close proximity to our
homes.

With the increased need of 5G communication for our ever growing cellular appetite , we cannot rush into quick
solutions that are eyesores and emit sounds that are objectionable. According to a New York Times article by
Allan Holmes on March 2, 2018, “residents across the country are just now beginning to understand the harms
that hasty and insensitive small cell developments can inflict on their communities.” To approve an antenna
that emits noise and to construct a unit that is aesthetically objectionable would go against the sense of pride
that neighbors share for our quiet tree lined streets.

I urge the ARB to deny approval to the proposed cell towers unless Verizon’s designs a) call for all the
equipment except the antenna to be located completely underground and b) comply with Palo Alto’s noise
ordinances.

Thank you,

Honorable Palo Alto City Council Members,

Over many years, the Terman Middle School PTA has supported the Charleston‐Arastradero Plan. Please note the
attached letter that the Terman PTA wrote in support when Council approved the Charleston‐Arastradero project in
2015. In addition, we also have attached the letter we sent in 2017 to support the city’s grant application for traffic
adaptive signal timing equipment funding for the project. The Terman Middle School PTA has repeatedly supported the
project through its various phases of development.

We are writing to affirm our strong support of the project as the city considers its infrastructure funding priorities.
Please move the project forward expediently this Spring as planned. After more than a decade of working in partnership
with the City of Palo Alto and PAUSD on this project, we look forward to construction of the long‐awaited school
commute safety hardscape improvements.

Thank you for your ongoing support of Safe Routes to School.

Sincerely,
Terman PTA Executive Board

Dear City Council and Planning & Transportation Commissioners,

Terman Middle School directly abuts Charleston/Arastradero Roads. With very few exceptions,
students who commute to this site must use this City of Palo Alto School Commute Corridor for some
portion of their school commute. The Terman Middle School PTA actively encourages alternative
commutes, so we consider the safety of this corridor to be a very high priority.

Terman Middle School PTA Traffic Safety Representatives and administrators have participated on
the Charleston/Arastradero Stakeholders Group and the City School Traffic Safety Committee,
providing comment and support for the Charleston/Arastradero Plan for more than a decade. Paint
striping was adequate for a restriping trial of road operations and it provided some safety
improvements. It is time to put the hardscape improvements in place that will deliver the lion’s share
of safety benefits to all users.

We ask you to approve the Concept Plan Lines which fine tune the striping plan that exists now
on the corridor. These plans provide planted medians, intersection and signal improvements, bulb-
outs, multi-use paths, buffered bicycle lanes, a new dedicated auto right turn lane into the Terman
Middle School campus from east bound Arastradero, and other built enhancements. The project is a
key component of the south Palo Alto bike boulevard network, safely connecting PAUSD corridor
schools to community residences and after-school destinations.

We look forward to a safer street environment for all road users—people who drive, people who bike,
and people who walk.

Thank you for City of Palo Alto’s partnership in creating safer routes to school.

Sincerely,



Donna M. Pioppi, President
Terman Middle School PTA
Ms. Celeste Fiore                                                                   February, 27, 2017

Dear Ms. Fiore,

We are writing to offer support for the City of Palo Alto grant application for Charleston/Arastradero
Adaptive Traffic Signal Timing.

Terman Middle School directly abuts Charleston/Arastradero Road. With very few exceptions, students
who commute to this site must use this City of Palo Alto School Commute Corridor for some portion of
their school commute. One average, 279 students bicycle to Terman each day. Many also walk to school
or ride a bus. Terman Middle School PTA actively encourages alternative commutes, so we consider the
safety of this corridor for foot-powered student commuters to be a high priority. Adaptive Signal Timing is
a key component of the City of Palo Alto’s multi-modal improvement plan for this sensitive arterial.

Active traffic signal management supports safe and efficient roadways. The Adaptive Traffic Signal
Timing on Charleston/Arastradero will improve traffic operations by improving travel time, reducing
congestion, and reducing idling, especially during the morning peak hour when crosstown commuter
traffic and school commute traffic converges, creating severe congestion. Traffic signal enhancements
will minimize the number of drivers slowing down suddenly, which also causes pollution. In turn, air
quality around our schools and in Palo Alto will be improved.

Adaptive traffic signal timing would enable completion of the transformation of this school commute
corridor that carries nearly 20,000 car trips per day and many hundreds of students on foot and on
bicycles to nearby schools.

Please approve the City of Palo Alto application for funding. We look forward to a safer street
environment for all road users—people who drive, people who bike, and people who walk.

Thank you.

Sincerely,




Cheryl Phillips

Attachments:                  AFFORDABLE HOUSING.pdf



Dear Planners and Council Members,
Affordable housing? Let’s think about this. And think again. What sort of place is this, anyway?
I’ve been living here for 38 years, raised 3 children, have been a student, a renter, a homeowner,
then a renter again…Like many, I am now a working grandmother, and I’d surely hope there will
be room for me to stay in our small city. Where do you stand?

In my many classrooms, my goal has always been to educate the heart. I'll speak to that now.

Our community, MOST of our community I should hope, is in favor of providing Affordable
Housing - AND IN SHORT ORDER. Please don’t disappoint? No one on the council, committee
or street should not be on board with the proposed relaxed standards that will promote construction
(can we say, immediate construction?) of Affordable Housing so seniors, families with disabled
children, low income workers, veterans and disabled young adults can remain where they have
grown up or grown old.

I hope not to be disappointed that our community, would want their legacy - or part of it - to be
deployed to PAY IT FORWARD, and sustain us.

Among the proposals are the relaxed standards (Relax! Just Do It!) greater square footage,
flexibility on retail requirements, parking standards…But, no need to build us a Taj Mahal folks,
just four walls and a roof, some indoor plumbing would be great…

And, here’s a constructive idea (pun intended) Why not consider taking over some existing
apartment complexes (whose landlord’s may be kvetching about their profit margins!) — Could
the city consider BUYING up existing apartment complexes, and converting them into Affordable
Housing?

Having lived here for 38 years, I’ve seen many changes but I hope hearts and minds are still in the
spirit of the Civl Rights Movement.…Facilitate provision for our diverse population. Keep Palo
Alto diverse, and not divided. Please Build back better, more and soon!

I am writing to plead with the board to deny Verizon's plans to install cell towers in Palo Alto's
residential neighborhoods! My additional concern is that this is described as "its first wave" of towers,
and I would like us to avoid the slippery slope.

If their aim is to erect the towers cheaply, the towers would be larger and require more noisy
supportive equipment, none of which would bring anything good to our residential areas.

We are already dealing with the city council thinking of ways to bring more density and congestion to
the area, and I hope we can stop the invasion of ugly towers and equipment threatening our
neighborhoods.

Thanks,
Barbara Bogner

Subject:                         Dog Training Areas in Palo Alto




Re: Dog Training Areas



We are a group of six responsible local residents who have highly trained dogs (a golden retriever, an
Australian shepherd, two Weimaraners, two collies, and two pit bull mixes) that compete in American Kennel
Club obedience competitions. The exercises we practice involve jumps, scent work, retrieves, heel work,
response to hand signals, recalls - skills that are accomplished with the dog working at a distance from where
we stand and can only be done off leash.

One of our dogs is an extremely accomplished pit bull mix; this dog has won many ribbons and participated in
the highly regarded AKC National Obedience Invitational Tournament, not once but twice. Another of our
members has participated in this event with a previous dog. All of these dogs have been in intensive training
for years.

We are asking for permission to use a small area at local parks for training practice once or twice per week,
starting around 9:00 am, finishing around 11:00 am. Our dogs need to be comfortable working in many
different locations, so we try to rotate around various areas to give them that experience. We define our
working space of 40 x 50 feet with posts and/or gates; the only time the dogs need to be off leash is within the
confines of that area. We set up away from the children’s play areas. These dogs do not run out of the training
area to visit passersby or other dogs, so they are not a bother to other park users. While waiting for their turn to
practice, the dogs are confined in crates, or warming up on leash just outside the confines of the practice ring.

Currently, there are no public locations where we can do this without the potential for a visit from Animal
Control, yet local communities allow AKC obedience & agility competitive matches and trials from time to
time where the off leash exercises take place within ring setups like these (Cuesta Park; Greer Park; Mitchell
Park; De Anza College). Most of us are members of Deep Peninsula Dog Training Club, Inc., that holds dog
training classes Monday evenings at Rengstorff Park. Dogs do work off leash in some of these classes, many of
which we all have attended; two of us have actually taught these classes.

It has become increasingly difficult to find areas in our local parks to train our dogs. Unfortunately, leash laws
prohibit our mode of training even within the well-defined boundaries of our set-up. Dog parks are not suitable
because there is no way we can prevent off-leash dogs from running into our training area, harassing our dogs,
and at times, peeing on our equipment. We do need an area close to available parking because of the necessity
of transporting ring gates and jumps. We are responsible dog owners and are extremely conscientious about
“picking up after our dogs.” We even pick up after other dogs that have left their calling cards in the area.

There are benefits to the community to allowing us to practice in public. People walking by are amazed by the
abilities of our dogs. They often stop to ask about them and their training. A couple of us carry business cards
for Deep Peninsula DTC because so many people want to know where they can find classes for their own dogs.
The demonstration of well-trained dogs responding to the quiet directions of their owners promotes responsible
ownership in others. Surely, the positive publicity we offer the public on training days and information about
training classes in the area would offset any inconvenience we might create.

Mountain View used to have a permit system for just such training requirements. Can you help us?

Hi George,

I’m inquiring about the recent change to Residential Electrical Panel Upgrade pricing in Palo Alto. It recently came to our
attention that the City Council (CCed here w/ the Mayor) voted to approve the new fee schedule that came into effect
on 2/1/18. Based on our conversation w/ the Building Department today, previous panel upgrades were priced
according to amperage (0‐200 Amps, 201‐400 Amps, 401‐800 Amps.) On 2/1/18 this fee structure changed to lump all
upgrades from 0‐800 Amps together. This has caused the cost of simple residential panel upgrade permit to skyrocket
from $138 in January to $373, just for the panel upgrade line item alone. Our most recent permit in Palo Alto for a
residential 200 Amp service upgrade w/ 50 Amp EV charger cost our company $622, which is the most we’ve ever paid
in 22+ jurisdictions for this type of project. If we did this same project just a few miles south in Los Altos, we’d only pay
$75 total for this permit.

Is there anything you can do to help fix this? We pass these permit costs on directly to our customers, but this revised
permit cost seems a bit excessive.

Dear City Council Members,
This email is to let you know that I am opposed to allowing the First Baptist Church on California
Avenue be turned into a Community Center. I hope that you deny their use of such a permit. Traffic
and parking are the two top issues for Palo Alto citizens. Using a church as a full-time community
center will only exacerbate the problems we have with cars and parking. There have already been
two accidents due to the church. I live near California Avenue and I have noticed an increase traffic.
We want our neighborhoods to be safe and to stay as neighborhoods.
Thank you.

Dear Mayor Kniss and City Council:

I was unable to make the meeting at Jordan Middle School on March 7th regarding First Baptist Church’s
request to become a Community Center, but I’ve been reading comments in both the Palo Alto Online & the PA
Daily Post. Many are concerned with traffic & safety issues which was the focus of my February 1st letter to the
Council.

My concerned for the safety of our children riding bikes in this area continues. The situation at Ross Road
regarding safety for bikers/cars will be mirrored when the California Avenue/Bryant roundabout & Bryant
Street bike path is completed.

Since my earlier letter there has been an accident on Bryant, a situation that sadly the neighborhood had
expected to see happen, though hoped would not. One car had just picked up children from the daycare. The
car had two small girls in the back seat where the impact occurred & airbags went off! The car that hit them
zipped around CA Ave down Bryant. I was told, though I don’t know for sure, that the car causing the accident
was a parent picking up students from the church. To my knowledge nobody came over to help from the church
& yet the back door closest to the accident was opened; students came out to look, but no adult. VERY scared
little girls. I’ve included pictures below.

If a community center, roundabout & bike path converge in that area it’s difficult to believe more accidents
won’t occur — as they say “it’s an accident waiting to happen.”

Please carefully consider what can be at FBC that does not impact child/bike safety & traffic.

Thank you,

Below are a few pictures:
