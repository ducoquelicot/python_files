Title: Revised Rail Corridor Circulation Study White Paper

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Planning and Community Environment

Recommendation
Staff is providing the attached Revised Rail Corridor Circulation Study White Paper (Attachment A) for
the Committee’s information. This revised report will be available to the new rail consultant team as
they conduct their analysis of grade separation alternatives. No Committee action is requested.

Executive Summary
The initial rail program consultant prepared a draft traffic circulation study to assess traffic conditions
along the rail corridor with and without various grade separations. The draft study was provided to the
Rail Committee and the public in late 2017 and staff received a number of comments and questions
which have been addressed in the attached, revised report. The report, now referred to as a “white
paper” will be available to the new rail consultant for their use as they conduct their analysis of grade
separation alternatives. This white paper supplements other white papers on (1) trenching and
tunneling; and (2) local financing.

Background and Discussion
The initial Rail Program Consultant was charged with completing a high-level circulation study. This
study included the following components:
    1. Data assembly and review (complete)
    2. Research existing documents (complete)
    3. Collect and examine multimodal traffic counts (complete)
    4. Validate base year in the regional and local travel demand models and adjust models to account
        for increased rail service along the corridor (underway)
    5. Collate and review any relevant development proposals within the study area (underway)
    6. Model future traffic conditions under up to eight scenarios to include:
             a. No build scenario with current rail corridor service
             b. No build scenario with increased rail corridor service (CalMod and HSR)
             c. Build scenario 1
             d. Build scenario 2
             e. Build scenario 3
             f. Build scenario 4
             g. Build scenario 5

    7.    Conduct field observations on travel behavioral patterns
    8.    Assess the record of collision occurrences at the rail crossings and surrounding areas
    9.    Analyze grade crossing hazards and gate downtime
    10.   Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate up to eight scenarios, using the following performance
          measures:
              a. Total vehicle miles travelled
              b. Total vehicle hours consumed
              c. Average trip length, trip duration time and highway network speed
              d. Changes in modal choice
              e. Total travel user benefits and collision savings benefits over a 20-year period
              f. Motor vehicle level of service by intersection
              g. LOS by movement at intersections
              h. Changes in specific origin-destination journey times
              i. Delays to transit services
              j. Delays to pedestrians and bicycles
              k. Motor vehicle queue lengths at intersections
              l. Delays at individual intersections by movement

The intent of the Rail Corridor Circulation Study was to estimate the effect on traffic circulation under up
to eight different scenarios that were modeled using the regional and local travel demand model. These
scenarios included several variations of grade crossings and grade separations at each railroad corridor
crossing location. The first two scenarios did not include any new grade crossings, new grade
separations or modifications to existing crossings, and were considered “no build” scenarios. The other
six scenarios included varying collections of new multi-modal grade-separated crossings, new bicycle
and pedestrian only grade-separated crossings, new grade separations, modified grade crossings, and
closed grade crossings. The analysis of scenarios was intended to inform the selection of grade
separations alternatives for more in depth study and evaluation.

Scenarios that were not included in the initial study may still emerge via the community process and
those that were for study selected were chosen in part for their ability to inform the development of
grade separation alternatives, including their physical attributes and phasing.

Please also note that where the circulation study assumes grade separations, it does not differentiate
between the type of separation (underground, above ground, etc.). This is due to the nature of the
study and means that additional circulation analysis will likely be needed for grade separation
alternatives that emerge through the community process if, for example, the type of separation results
in local street closures in the vicinity.

.

At a high level, the study considers the impacts of potential future modifications to the current at-grade
and grade-separated crossings and its findings are intuitive. To construct a grade separation where
currently there is an existing at-grade crossing clearly reduces the interference or obstruction caused by
that crossing and therefore improves east/west access/capacity at that location. That may or may not
attract additional traffic to that crossing. Similarly, closing (i.e. eliminating) an existing at-grade crossing
will cause traffic to divert to other routes. The intent of this study is to estimate changes to motor

vehicle and bicycle traffic circulation/demands with changes in accessibility/capacity caused by railroad
crossing-related infrastructure improvement scenarios. To the extent that it is possible with the
demand models, an order-of-magnitude quantification of those changes is described.

Even if no changes or modifications are made to the existing rail crossings, increases in traffic demands
driven by land use and population growth would occur between existing and future (2030) conditions.
Motor vehicle traffic is forecast to grow at a little over 1% per year. The Caltrain service modifications,
made possible by the electrification, are likely to double the number of trains in the peak periods
compared to now, when they are implemented. There is also the potential for having high-speed rail
services on this line, in addition to Caltrain. The combination of the increased frequency of gate closures
at the crossings and increased traffic flows will undoubtedly increase road congestion from what it is
now.

Two types of Year 2030 “No Build” scenarios were defined in the study. A Year 2030 “Business as Usual”
scenario was first developed that includes growth in traffic between current and Year 2030 conditions
while assuming no change to existing rail service frequencies, and no change in existing roadway
circulation conditions. Included in the Circulation Study tests, is another Year 2030 “No Build” scenario
where both the increased train frequencies and increased traffic growth (between existing and year
2030) are simulated within the demand models, while assuming no future construction occurs. The
second No Build scenario forms the ‘baseline’ from which comparisons against the scenario tests are
made.

Finally, conclusions are drawn from the series of “sensitivity” tests carried out for sample scenarios. It is
important to note what is forecast to happen if nothing is done to improve the crossings and not only
whether diversions will occur under various scenarios of infrastructure changes, but whether their
impact is likely to be significant or not.

On June 28, 2017, a staff report was presented to the City Council Rail Committee entitled “Draft Rail
Program Circulation Study Scenarios.” In this Staff Report, six (6) different scenarios were recommended
for study that were intended to support the identification and evaluation of grade separation
alternatives.

On November 29, 2017, the draft Rail Corridor Circulation Study White Paper, containing the outcomes
of those studies, was presented to the City Council Rail Committee. As a result, the City Council Rail
Committee requested the following modifications to the White Paper:
     Fix the analysis of closing Churchill Avenue
     Add a scenario including closures of the four at-grade crossings
     Evaluate modeling a closure at Palo Alto Avenue
     Utilize Stanford General Use Permit (GUP) data
     Continue the bicycle and pedestrian discussion to a future meeting
     Develop a seventh scenario including:
            o Separation of the existing four at-grade crossing
            o Updated data including Stanford GUP data
            o Updated Churchill Avenue data
     Develop an eight scenario with the only change being closing Churchill Avenue.

The attached revised white paper includes the following modifications in response to the Committee
review and public comments/questions:
     White paper was combined with the Existing Conditions and the Model Validation reports into
        one document with a new Executive Summary;
     Responses to comments from the public were incorporated into the model update, additional
        model runs, and revised white paper;
     Model loading and validation issues at Churchill Avenue and Palo Alto Avenue were fixed;
     Data from Stanford GUP Application traffic study was incorporated;
     New traffic counts (November 2017) replaced the February 2017 counts, which were done
        during a non-standard school week;
     The City’s CUBE model was refined to better fit the latest traffic count data using the MEOD
        process within the CUBE suite of computer programs (the refined model shows a much better
        degree of fit to counted traffic volumes at key intersections along Alma Street); and
     Carried out an operational (Synchro) analysis with the November 2017 traffic data set, which
        showed that with that data set there was a slight deterioration in the intersection levels-of-
        service for less than one third of the intersections, as compared the analyses using the February
        2017 traffic data set.

The following modifications were not completed at this time, but can be incorporated into future
studies if/as desired:
     Run all six (6) scenarios again with validated model and new data;
     Run new Scenario 7 with existing conditions plus Churchill Avenue crossing closed to motor
         vehicles; or
     Run new Scenario 8 with all at-grade crossings separated, including Churchill Avenue.

Like the other white papers we’ve prepared about local financing methods and trenching/tunneling
issues, this white paper is intended to support community discussions and City Council deliberations
about rail grade separation alternatives and will be supplemented with additional in-depth analysis
when four to eight grade-separation alternatives are advanced to the alternatives analysis phase of the
process.

The high-level conclusions in the Revised Rail Corridor Circulation Study White Paper are similar to those
of the draft paper. As this study represents a very high-level analysis, it is not anticipated that any of the
conclusions drawn from the draft paper would change if/when the validated model and the November
2017 traffic count data were to be used for Year 2030 model runs.

Timeline
The initial Rail Corridor Circulation Study model runs are complete and the draft paper has been revised
to reflect many of the comments received from the Rail Committee and the public. Additional model
runs are anticipated as part of the in depth analysis of alternatives selected for further study.

Resource Impact
Funding for the Revised Rail Corridor Circulation Study is included in the Fiscal Year 2018 Adopted
Capital Budget in CIP PL-17001, Railroad Grade Separation.

Policy Implications



City of Palo Alto                                                                                      Page 4
The Revised Rail Corridor Circulation Study is consistent with the following Comprehensive Plan goals,
policies and programs:

        Program T1.19.3 Increase the number of east-west pedestrian and bicycle crossings across Alma
         Street and the Caltrain corridor, particularly south of Oregon Expressway.

        Policy T-3.13 Work with Caltrans, Santa Clara County and VTA to improve east and west
         connections in Palo Alto and maintain a circulation network that binds the city together in all
         directions.

        Policy T-3.15 Pursue grade separation of rail crossings along the rail corridor as a City priority.

        Program T3.15.1 Undertake studies and outreach necessary to advance grade of Caltrain to
         become a “shovel ready” project and strongly advocate for adequate State, regional and federal
         funding for design and construction of railroad grade separations.

        Program T3.15.2 Conduct a study to evaluate the implications of grade separation on bicycle
         and pedestrian circulation.

        Policy T-3.16 Keep existing at-grade rail crossings open to motor vehicles, pedestrians and
         bicyclists, consistent with results of a focused circulation study and a context sensitive
         alternatives analysis.

        Policy T-3.17 Until grade separation is completed, improve existing at-grade rail crossings to
         ensure the highest feasible level of safety along the corridor and provide additional safe,
         convenient crossings.

        Program T3.17.1 Complete a Palo Alto Avenue crossing study to identify potential near-term
         safety and accessibility improvements.

        Program T3.17.2 Work with Caltrain to ensure that the rail tracks are safe and secure with
         adequate fencing and barriers.

        Policy T-4.1 Keep all neighborhood streets open as a general rule.


        Policy T-4.3 Identify specific improvements that can be used to discourage drivers from using
         local, neighborhood streets to bypass traffic congestion on arterials.

Environmental Review
The Rail Corridor Circulation Study is a planning study and thus is not a “project” requiring
environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

This White Paper reports on the Traffic Circulation Studies and related planning work carried out to
date for grade-separation and other treatments of the existing roadways in the City of Palo Alto that
currently cross the Caltrain tracks at-grade.

The report covers three (3) major elements: Existing Conditions; the Travel Demand Model that
was used for a large part of the analyses, and the outcomes of six (6) sample scenarios of possible
alternative combinations of treatments and infrastructure proposals for the Caltrain crossings. The
study area is shown in Figure 1.

The Existing Conditions section of the report includes a description of the Study Area which
encompasses the Northwest/Southeast Caltrain corridor through the City of Palo Alto, and is
approximately four (4) miles in length. The focus of the report is the half-mile area centered around
the rail corridor with specific consideration of the four (4) existing at-grade crossings – Palo Alto
Avenue; Churchill Avenue; Meadow Drive and Charleston Road. There are three (3) Caltrain
Stations within the city -- Palo Alto; California Avenue and Stanford; the latter being an events-
related station only. The major arterial that runs parallel to the rail line is Alma Street. There are
also (4) four motor vehicle grade-separated crossings. These are University Avenue;
Embarcadero; Oregon Expressway and San Antonio Road; the latter only being partially in the City
of Palo Alto.

Major Northwest/Southeast routes through the city and parallel to the Caltrain tracks include U.S.
Highway 101; Interstate 280 and El Camino Real.

In terms of commute percentage modes, the City of Palo Alto has over 15 percent (%) less car use
and over 10 percent (%) more bicycle and pedestrian use than Santa Clara County. It is forecast

that the current bicycle use which was at 9.2 percent (%) of all modes in 2015, will rise to 15
percent (%) by 2020.

The Existing Conditions report also describes the Policy Framework; Caltrain and other transit
Operations; road traffic operations and safety; land use demographics and bicycle and pedestrian
networks.

The Caltrain two-way service currently peaks at 10 trains per hour through the city. For the four (4)
hour peak periods however, the average is approximately six (6) for the AM and seven (7) for the
PM. The worst congestion is caused when the highest peak traffic flows coincide with the highest
frequency of rail-gate closures. Peak occurrences of both conditions do not necessarily coincide at
the at-grade crossings either by time or location, and are spread over the peak periods. To capture
all the impacts, the Demand Model uses an average hour for each of the four (4) hour peak
periods, AM and PM.

The overall current traffic conditions for the rail crossings average to a level-of-service E, with Palo
Alto Avenue and Charleston Road reaching a level-of-service F in the PM peak hour.

For the times in the peak hours when the traffic signals cycle do not include a rail-gate closure, the
level-of-service of the crossing routes intersecting with Alma Street range from C-D.

The Travel Demand Model Validation section of the report deals with the methodology employed
for the traffic impact appraisals within the circulation studies.
                                                FT
There are two (2) parts to the appraisal process. The first part estimates the likely impacts on road
traffic behavior generated by the various alternative sample scenarios in terms of growth in
demand and the route diversion effects. The second part carries out a more detailed assessment
of the traffic operational issues at the individual road intersections involved. In combination, these
                                               A
two (2) types of appraisals can provide a comprehensive measure of the impacts of alternative
layouts and treatments of the Caltrain crossing facilities.
                                            R

A Demand Model, the City’s own CUBE travel demand model, was the basis of the analyses. The
process, therefore, has compatibility with other similar exercises, such as evaluating the
transportation elements of the City’s Comprehensive Plan. The first step in the process is to carry
                                      D


out a validation of the base model against observations. This is a way of assessing how the model
can be used most beneficially. The City’s model is very large, covering the Peninsula and parts of
the Bay area. Large models, unless used in special locations (such as rural areas with sparse road
networks) are seldom reliable for traffic volume estimates at individual street level or for
intersection turning movements. The validation process is not a “pass or fail” exercise; it is done to
allow a judgment on how the model may be best used in the appraisal.

Model validations showed that the City’s base model could not be used alone for the full appraisal.
For the forecasts, the process used a combination of the model forecasts and the traffic count data
to estimate future traffic volumes. A second model was subsequently calibrated to local count data
along the Caltrain corridor in the City. This second model process used count data from the most
recent survey carried out in November 2017, and data from the Stanford General Use Permit
application. The volumes and local distribution of the trips within the base model were refined to
reflect the local traffic conditions as quantified by the traffic surveys. A second validation was then
carried out that showed a better fit for the second model. However, further use of the latest model
did not proceed and the results contained in this white paper for forecasts rely on the original
model. This model and the process used for forecasting are perfectly adequate for the analysis at
this stage. The updated model may be used for a more locally focused analysis at a later stage in
the project.




                                                                                                           2

The model was then used to estimate the impacts of the 2030 future year “No Build 1 and 2”
conditions and six (6) separate sample scenarios. The method used does not rely on the CUBE
Model alone, but combines the forecasts with the locally counted data. This method is called “the
Difference Method” and is fully described in Section 6.3 of the “National Cooperative Highway
Research Program – Report 765: Analytical Travel Forecasting Approaches for Project-Level
Planning and Design.” It is an industry standard method and has been used throughout the San
Francisco/San Jose region.

The initial modeling used traffic count data from February 2017. A second set of traffic count data
was collected in November 2017 as a verification process. This second data set showed a slightly
higher traffic volume for some of the movements. An existing year analysis was carried out to
measure the changes between the two (2) data sets. It was found to be marginal only. The
conclusions within the report rely on the February 2017 traffic count data and the original travel
demand model. It is not considered that using the second model and the November 2017 data set
for traffic counts would significantly alter the conclusion.

This appraisal was not intended to select any one layout of alternative treatments of the Caltrain
crossings. It was intended to provide decision makers with an informational background as to the
likely impacts of selecting a “short list” of scenarios for a more detailed analysis. It is essentially a
high-level planning study.

The six (6) sample scenarios are a “generic” selection from an almost infinite number of
                                                 FT
possibilities. They range from almost a complete closure of all the at-grade crossing points
(minimum access) to a scenario where every at-grade crossing is grade separated apart from
Churchill Avenue (maximum access). In all 2030 tests described (As “No Build 2” and Sample
Scenarios 1-6), the train/gate closure frequency was assumed to be 20/hour for the total of two-
way operations.
                                                A
The appraisal showed that although six (6) scenarios is only a fraction of the vast number of
possible combinations and permutations that exist for different layouts of crossings in the City, the
                                            R

tests completed provide a reasonable picture of the likely outcomes of making different decisions
on the rail-crossing layouts.
                                      D


In general, the outcomes of the tests are intuitive. As traffic demand grows and the capacity of the
at-grade crossings reduce due to increased rail gate closures, those crossings that remain at grade
shed traffic to either the existing grade-separated crossings or any that will be newly constructed
as grade separated.

If grade-separated crossings were to be constructed at a location where there was previously an
at-grade crossing, then some traffic would be attracted to that route from other routes, including
from existing grade-separated crossings. The extent to which this may happen in terms of
additional traffic volumes varies. Charleston Road is particularly likely to experience significant
additional traffic attraction, if it is grade separated. This is unsurprising as Charleston Road,
together with Arastradero Road, form one of the few easy connecting routes between the I-280 and
U.S. Highway 101.

The minimum access scenario test is likely to divert out of the City the 15 percent (%) growth in
traffic demand from 2017 to 2030, diverting the remaining traffic from the routes that are closed to
those that are grade separated.

The maximum access test (Sample Scenario 6) showed that an additional 5-plus percent (%) of
traffic crossing the Caltrain tracks in the City was likely to be attracted over and above the “No
Build 2” scenario. The table below was constructed to provide a summary assessment of the likely

Note: If the Caltrain tracks were to be in tunnel or entrenched throughout the City, the responses would be

The second part of the appraisal of the sample scenarios was to carry out traffic operational

analyses at the key individual intersections within the Caltrain rail corridor.

In total, 13 intersections were analyzed, between two (2) and four (4) on each of the currently at-
                                                R

grade crossing routes. The 2030 forecast flows were estimated by the addition of the February
2017 traffic survey counts and the growth forecast by the Demand Model.
                                       D


A comparison of the February 2017 and November 2017 analyses for existing conditions show
very little change in the outcomes. Almost seventy-five percent (75%) showed the same level-of-
service and of those that did change, in almost every case only a deterioration of one (1) level
resulted. This means that although at a detailed level there could be a slight underestimation of the
severity of congestion in less than one third of cases, the overall picture remains the same
irrespective of which traffic count data set is used.

The operational analyses were carried out under two (2) future conditions at the intersections:
First, when there were rail gate closures in some of the traffic signal cycles (for an overall average
condition) and second, when no gate closures were assumed to be in the signal cycle.

For the first condition, the levels-of-service were only estimated at the actual crossings for a “No
Build 2” scenario (e.g., if no infrastructure changes were made to any of the crossings but the
train/gate closure frequency grew to 20 per hour). The average condition at the at-grade crossings
for both peak hours (AM and PM) would be level-of-service F. It is estimated that the queues for
many of the movements would be unclearable, a condition where a greater volume of traffic joins
the queue than is released through the intersections for a given traffic signal cycle. The queue
accumulates with time until either the traffic demand and/or the frequency of the rail gate closure
reduces and the operational capacity is increased.




                                                                                                                            4

The second part of the analyses was to assess operating conditions at the intersections, without
assuming a rail gate closure occurred in the traffic signal cycle. This showed that where a grade-
separated intersection was assumed constructed, resulting in an increase in traffic demand, the
level-of-service for all the intersections on that route would deteriorate.

For those crossing routes that remain at-grade, it is likely that the intersections will operate at level-
of-service F for the times when there is a rail gate-closure. However, that may also have the effect
of discouraging drivers from using that route. This would mean the level-of-service may improve for
the times when no gate closure occurred. Train frequencies of 20 per hour in peak periods by 2030
substantially increases the likelihood of a traffic signal cycle that includes a gate closure. Due to
the random nature of both traffic demand intensity and rail gate closures, very serious delays and
traffic disruptions are likely to occur.

For those routes that do have future grade separations, where none exists today, increased traffic
flows are likely to occur and thus the level-of-service at the intersections, if unmodified, on that
route may deteriorate.

A variety of bicycle and pedestrian measures were tested within the sample scenarios. Two (2)
grade-separated bicycle/pedestrian-only facilities currently exist at Homer Avenue and California
Avenue. Future potential grade separated bicycle/pedestrian-only crossings were tested at Everett
Avenue/Lytton Avenue; Churchill Avenue (close proximity to); Loma Verde Avenue/Arastradero
Creek and Meadow Drive (close proximity to).
                                                FT
Accessibility mapping was used to measure the impact for the different layout configurations in the
sample scenarios. The results showed that where an existing at-grade crossing is assumed closed
to all modes, then the bicycle/pedestrian accessibility across the Caltrain tracks would be seriously
reduced. Currently, there is a significant gap between Oregon Expressway and Meadow Drive.
                                               A
If all the proposed bicycle/pedestrian grade-separations are implemented (whether as an all mode
facility or just for bicycles and pedestrians) then the level of accessibility across the Caltrain track
                                            R

would be very high.

In terms of Road Safety, between 2011 and 2015, a total of 88 accident collisions were recorded of
                                      D


which 32 involved injury and one (1) fatality. Although it may depend on the actual designs of
improvements to the at-grade crossings, new construction is likely to reduce this considerably.

1 Introduction

The City of Palo Alto (referred to as the “City”) is preparing for increases in passenger rail service along
the existing Caltrain rail corridor and potential impacts to existing at-grade crossings associated with
service increases. Passenger rail service changes will be a result of the Peninsula Corridor Electrification
Project (PCEP) and potentially the California High-Speed Rail (HSR) project.

The City of Palo Alto is bisected by the Caltrain rail corridor and enjoys both the benefits as well as the
impacts associated with rail service: train noise and vibration, traffic congestion around grade crossings,
and community safety concerns. These impacts are expected to grow as train service in the corridor
increases regardless of whether or not the state’s HSR project comes to fruition. As a result, the City is
conducting a study to assess grade separation alternatives and minimize the impact of increased rail
services on local traffic, the basis of which is referred to as the “Rail Program” throughout this document.

In 2010, the City Council initiated the Palo Alto Rail Corridor Study to evaluate land use, transportation,
and urban design elements of the rail corridor, particularly in response to potential improvements to
passenger rail service on the Caltrain corridor. The study report, as a result of a two-year process,
includes an analysis of those elements and their potential impacts from the range of possible rail
improvements, including Caltrain upgrades, such as electrification and/or grade separations, and/or the
potential options for the HSR project1. In early 2014, the City conducted a study for conceptual grade
                                                                FT
separation alternatives for a portion of the Caltrain right-of-way encompassing three existing at-grade
crossings: Charleston Road, Meadow Drive, and Churchill Avenue2. This study provided preliminary
information on the potential impacts and costs of construction (by order of magnitude) for various
roadway depression and trenching of the railroad alternatives. A railroad trench alternative would place
the railroad tracks and rail operations below street-level, thus separating train traffic from motor vehicles,
                                                               A
pedestrian, and bicyclist activity at the street-level. The study was not definitive in determining an ultimate

2 Policy Framework

The City of Palo Alto is the lead agency for the Rail Program, and as such this section
summarizes City policies that govern the Rail Corridor Circulation Study. The purpose of this
review is to ensure that the Circulation Study is consistent with existing and planned future
transportation and development policies and strategies.

2.1        Palo Alto Policies
The Circulation Study process builds upon the City’s previous planning efforts to accommodate
future transit growth along the existing Caltrain corridor, brought about by the California High-
Speed Rail (HSR) project, the Peninsula Corridor Electrification Project (PCEP), and the
growing population of the San Francisco Bay Area. Existing plans, policies, and guidelines set
the foundation for the corridor planning process and the development of an implementable
document. Key City documents include the Palo Alto Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation
Plan, the Palo Alto Climate Protection Plan, the City of Palo Alto Municipal Code, the Rail
Corridor Study, and the Transportation Element of the City of Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan.
The Rail Corridor Study was developed by the Rail Corridor Task Force to generate a
community vision for land use, transportation, and urban design opportunities along the Caltrain
                                                            FT
corridor. This policy document was incorporated into the Comprehensive Plan in 2013 and
provides land use and transportation policies under a variety of scenarios. It is the intention of
this study to build on the outcomes of the Rail Corridor Study.

2.1.1         Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan – Transportation Element
                                                           A
The City of Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan was last revised in 2007 and is currently in the
process of being updated. It is the primary document guiding the City’s planning decisions. The
                                                R

Transportation Element of the existing Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan includes 10 goals to guide
the development of the City’s transportation programs and facilities (see Table 2-1). A total of 57
policies and 58 programs are identified in the current Comprehensive Plan’s transportation

2.1.2         Palo Alto Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan
                                              R

The Palo Alto 2012 Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan (BPTP 2012) was adopted in
July 2012 and builds upon the 2003 Bicycle Transportation Plan by adding coverage of
                                       D


pedestrian issues, priorities, and design standards. The BPTP 2012 contains the policy vision,
design guidance, and specific recommendations to increase walking and biking rates over the
next decade and beyond – rates that will be instrumental in helping to address the impacts of
regional growth while maintaining mobility. Objective One in the BPTP 2012 aims to “double the
rate of bicycling for both local and total work commutes by 2020 (to 15 percent and 5 percent,
respectively.)” This objective supports Goals T-1 and T-3 of the City’s Comprehensive Plan.
Objective Four, which aims to “plan, construct, and maintain ‘Complete Streets’ that are safe
and accessible to all modes and people of all ages and abilities,” supports and expands Goal T-
3 of the City’s current Comprehensive Plan.

2.1.3         Palo Alto Climate Protection Plan
The City of Palo Alto adopted a Climate Protection Plan (CPP) in December 2007. The City then
updated the mid-term and long-term Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals for both
municipal and community-wide GHG emissions in 2010. Overall GHG emissions in 2013 within
the City were estimated to have decreased 29 percent from 2005 levels, which exceeds the
City’s goal of 15 percent reduction below 2005 levels by 2020. The CPP contains a range of
goals and actions that target GHG emissions reductions from the transportation sector,
including measures to promote alternative fuels, facilitate increased biking and walking,
increase mass transit availability, and encourage electronic alternatives to travel. In 2015, the
City began the preparation of a Sustainability and Climate Action Plan (S/CAP) and adopted a



                                                                                                    9

new GHG reduction goal of 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, otherwise referred to as the
“80x30” goal.

2.1.4           Palo Alto Municipal Code
The purpose of the City’s Municipal Code is to protect and promote the public’s health and
safety through ordinances and regulations. Title 10 regulates vehicle and traffic operations
within the City, including traffic-control devices, pedestrian safety, bicycling safety and routes,
and general vehicle and traffic safety. For example, chapter 10.32 establishes pedestrian safety
regulations, such as the establishment and appropriate usage of crosswalks. Chapter 10.36
addresses general parking regulations, such as where parking is permitted.

2.1.5           Safe Routes to School
                                                                                      Figure 2-2: Safe Routes to

collaborative effort between the City of Palo Alto and the
Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD). Its goal is to
improve safety for school commuters and to reduce school
commute-related congestion on city streets. Approximately
14 percent of Palo Alto’s students walk to school daily,
while 4,000 students from the PAUSD bike to school, as
shown in Figure 2-2.

The program is consistent with key transportation goals
outlined in the City’s Comprehensive Plan, including giving
                                                             FT

      that meet adopted criteria, and T-46, which encourages the City-sponsored bicycle
      education programs in the public schools.
The SRTS Program produced 18 Walk and Roll maps that outline suggested bicycle and
pedestrian paths around a one-mile radius of a school within PAUSD. Among the 18 Walk and
Roll Maps, four maps designate suggested routes that cross two of the four identified at-grade
crossings within the Study Area. These four Walk and Roll Maps are:

3 Study Area

The study area is defined as the half-mile area centered around the rail corridor in the City,
including the four existing at-grade crossings. The rail corridor in the City spans approximately
four miles in length, and includes three train stations: Palo Alto Station, Stanford Station, and
California Ave Station. The major arterial that runs parallel to the rail line is Alma Street. There
are five existing grade separations in the City, including University Ave, Homer Ave (bike/
pedestrian undercrossing), Embarcadero Road, Oregon Expressway, and California Ave (bike/
pedestrian undercrossing), and a portion of the San Antonio Road separation touches the City
boundary as well. The study area map is shown in Figure 3-1.

The City of Palo Alto is located in the northwest portion of Santa Clara County in the San
Francisco Bay Area. The community is largely residential with sizeable employment in the
management, business, science, and arts industries. Approximately 65 percent of residents
                                                   R

commute to work by driving alone and almost six percent of residents take transit. In
comparison, 76 percent of Santa Clara County residents commute by driving alone and less
than four percent of residents take transit, as detailed in Table 3-1. The City is one of the most
                                       D


bike-friendly cities in the nation, and this is reflected in the rate of residents who use bicycles as
their primary commute mode. Over nine percent of Palo Alto residents commute locally by
bicycle currently, and the BPTP 2012 seeks to increase this rate to 15 percent by 2020 under
the plan’s Objective One.

3.3       At-Grade Crossings
The following section presents each of the four at-grade crossings, with a discussion of physical
attributes and surrounding land uses. An at-grade crossing is an intersection of a roadway or
path and a railroad at the same level, as opposed to the railroad crossing over or under via a
bridge or tunnel. Information included in the following sections was sourced from the February
2016 Caltrain Grade Crossing Hazards Analysis.

3.3.1         Palo Alto Avenue
The Palo Alto Avenue at-grade crossing is the northernmost crossing within the City. Palo Alto
Avenue is a minor two-lane collector street that connects El Camino Real (State Route 82) with
Alma Street. The Palo Alto Avenue approach is stop-sign controlled at Alma Street, just east of
the railroad. Palo Alto Avenue extends northwest of Alma Street as an at-grade crossing over
the railroad tracks, and extends west to connect to form a signalized intersection at El Camino
Real/Sand Hills Road                   Figure 3-3: Palo Alto Avenue At-Grade Crossing
approximately 300 feet west of
the railroad crossing. The Palo                                  El Palo Alto
Alto segment through the
railroad crossing has a general
two-lane cross-section, with
Class II bike lanes and a
sidewalk/pedestrian path on the
north side of the road. Class II
bike lanes are on-street marked
                                                FT
bike lanes for the exclusive use
of bicycles. Currently, Palo Alto

The Churchill Avenue/Alma Street intersection is an existing at-grade signalized intersection
located within close proximity (less than 50 feet) from the railroad crossing, and as such
represents the key intersection that influences at-grade railroad crossing operations. In 2015,
the City of Palo Alto, Caltrain, Caltrans Rail Division, and the California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) met to review the Churchill Avenue crossing to determine possible funding
of safety improvements through the Federal Section 130 funds. Currently, Churchill Avenue
carried an average weekday traffic of approximately 9,200 vehicles and 1,020 bicycles per day

The planned grade separation of                   Figure 3-11: Everett Avenue Planned Grade
Everett Avenue would connect Quarry                                     Separation
Road (at the north end of the Stanford
University campus) with the Bryant
Street bicycle boulevard and the Palo
Alto Caltrain Station. Everett Avenue is
one of 15 priority crossings identified by
the Palo Alto Rail Task Force. The Palo
Alto 2012 BPTP identified opportunities
to improve linkages to services and
enhance the bicycle and pedestrian
connections. The resulting
improvements that were proposed
include installing additional traffic circles
and wayfinding improvements along
Everett Avenue to designate it as a           Source: Google Earth 2016
“complete” bicycle boulevard. Bicycle
boulevards are signed, shared roadways with low vehicle volume which prioritize convenient
and safe bicycle travel through the use of traffic calming strategies.

Currently, the lack of a grade-separated crossing somewhat isolates the El Camino Park, shown
in Figure 3-11 from the Downtown North neighborhoods in Palo Alto. The nearest railroad
crossings are the Palo Alto Avenue grade crossing to the north and the University Avenue
grade-separated crossing to the south. By implementing a grade-separated crossing at Everett
                                                   A
Avenue, there could be opportunities to provide connections between the Park, the surrounding
communities, Stanford University, the Stanford University Medical Center, and the Stanford
Shopping Center.

Pedestrian and bicycle access will most likely be accomplished through a grade-separated
underpass where vehicles would be prohibited. Coordination between the City, Caltrain,
                                       D

Figure 3-12, is complex due to the convergence of the multi-modal Palo Alto station, El Camino
Real, and the gateway to both the university and Downtown Palo Alto. This station is a critical
connection for transit vehicles and is served by VTA, SamTrans, and Stanford University
Marguerite shuttles.

The grade separation caters primarily to vehicular traffic, with four lanes and no Class II bicycle
lanes, however there is adequate pedestrian access through the underpass and cyclists are
permitted on University Avenue (Figure 3-13 and Figure 3-14). Currently, traffic volumes along
University Avenue remain relatively manageable at 19,000 ADT. Opportunities exist to improve

creating safer bicyclist and pedestrian passage through the underpass.

Figure 3-18) allows for vehicular,
pedestrian, and bicycle access. Its
proximity to the Palo Alto High

route for pedestrian and bicycle
traffic during peak hours. Currently,
average daily traffic volumes can
reach up to 25,000 vehicles per
day. While commuters see the
benefits of this safe railroad
underpass, some pedestrian and

Oregon Expressway is a high-volume
arterial currently carrying an average daily
traffic volume of 31,000 vehicles per day,
and the Alma Street interchange poses
some minor pedestrian and vehicular
conflicts. In addition, this particular
underpass has been prone to flooding
during rainy seasons due to issues with the
drainage system.

3.4.9         San Antonio Road
The San Antonio Road grade separation allows for vehicular travel over the railroad tracks.
Most of the separation falls within the City of Mountain View; however, a portion of the San
Antonio Road overpass falls within the City of Palo Alto, as shown in Figure 3-25. The San
Antonio Caltrain Station lies less than 500 feet southeast of the crossing and is surrounded by a
mix of commercial offices, educational facilities, and medium-density residential communities.
Pedestrians and bicyclists are prohibited on the San Antonio Road overpass; however, they
may access the opposite side of

current high volume of average
daily traffic, approximately
36,000 vehicles per day, may be
intimidating to pedestrians and
bicyclists on the surrounding
streets. Opportunities exist to
improve connectivity at this
grade separation by adding a
new bicycle crossing, although
special attention should be paid
to conflicts between vehicles,
pedestrians, and bicycles in the
area.

4.3       Caltrain Capital Projects
The information on the following Caltrain capital projects was primarily sourced from the
February 2016 Caltrain Grade Crossing Hazards Analysis.

4.3.1         Signal Preemption Improvement Project
The Signal Preemption Improvement Project will upgrade the interface between the Caltrain
grade crossing warning system and the traffic signal control system at five grade crossings in
three cities and the County of Santa Clara. New traffic signal equipment and roadway
improvements will be constructed at Brewster Avenue in Redwood City, and Rengstorff Avenue
and Castro Street in Mountain View. Electrical upgrades and improvements to the pedestrian
crossing system will be constructed at Churchill Avenue and East Meadow Drive in Palo Alto. At
all locations, the preemption interface between the grade crossing warning system and traffic
signal control system will be upgraded to a new 10-wire preemption circuit to provide improved
preemption safety at the grade crossings. The upgraded systems will provide increased
capability to clear vehicle traffic and exchange information between systems, in addition to
improving ADA access for pedestrians and normal traffic operation of the intersections.

4.3.2         CBOSS Positive Train Control System
Caltrain has developed specifications for an enhanced Positive Train Control (PTC) system,
referred to as Communications Based Overlay Signal System (CBOSS), which incorporate the
                                               FT
essential functions of positive train separation, over-speed enforcement, and roadway worker
protection, plus other capabilities specifically designed to improve grade crossing performance.
CBOSS is a vital overlay of the existing wayside signal system, providing a transition from
Caltrain’s Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) block signal system. In addition, CBOSS will allow
                                              A
Caltrain to reduce the peak minimum operating headway to five minutes, greatly increasing
system capacity. CBOSS is specified to be compliant with the requirements of the Rail Safety
Improvement Act of 2008 and all relevant regulations provided by 49 CFR 236. Furthermore,

Caltrain is participating in discussions with the interchanging railroads to achieve a PTC system
solution that is interoperable with freight operator systems.
                                       D


Caltrain has been working to implement PTC on its corridor for several years to achieve the
resulting safety and performance benefits. CBOSS will prevent over-speed-related derailments
and collisions between trains under normal “signaled moves”. When PTC enforcement cannot
be sustained, CBOSS provides contingency operating modes that allow operations to be
conducted with reduced risk by enabling the train engineer to revert to CTC operations through
the temporary use of the wayside signals. CBOSS also provides a “Restricted Manual”
operating mode to enhance safety when the wayside signal system is unable to display
permissive signals. While in Restricted Manual mode, CBOSS enforces the Restricted Speed to
ensure that collisions at elevated speed do not occur.

The CBOSS system will provide a crossing inhibit function, whereby a train which is making a
station stop will not activate the grade crossing warning system, including advance preemption,
as the train is approaching the station with an enforced stop short of the crossing. The CBOSS
system will then provide an operator initiated start to the crossing and traffic signal preemption
circuits prior to departing the station.

4.3.3         Peninsula Corridor Electrification Project (PCEP)
The Peninsula Corridor Electrification Project (PCEP) would electrify the Caltrain Corridor from
San Francisco’s 4th and King Station to the Tamien Station in San Jose, convert diesel-hauled
to Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) trains, and increase service to up to six Caltrain trains per peak

hour per direction by 2021. Initially, service between San Francisco and San Jose would
include a mixed fleet of EMU’s and diesel locomotives. Eventually diesel locomotives would be
replaced with EMUs over time as they reach the end of their service life. Caltrain’s diesel-
powered locomotive service would continue to be used to provide service between the San Jose
Diridon and Gilroy stations. The PCEP will allow Caltrain to operate quieter, cleaner, more
frequent train service to more riders. Increased capacity and improved service will help Caltrain
meet increasing ridership demand. Estimated ridership increases for 2020 and 2040 are shown
in Table 4-5.

4.3.4         PCEP Relation to the High-Speed Rail Project
The electrification system envisioned for the corridor would be configured in such a way that it
would support the future operation of California HSR. Twenty-five-kV, 60-Hz single-phase AC
electrification would be the power supply system of choice for a steel-wheel-on-steel-rail high-
                                                        FT
speed train operation. The Caltrain corridor is currently only rated for a maximum of 79 mph
and, thus, there would be a need for track and other system upgrades to support higher speeds
than at present. The Proposed PCEP includes electrification infrastructure that would first be
used by Caltrain and could later be used for high-speed trains. However, the proposed project
does not include other improvements necessary for high-speed trains such as platform
                                                       A
improvements, high-speed rail maintenance facilities, passing tracks or other Core Capacity
projects. The proposed project does not include improvements to support speeds greater than
79 mph or high-speed rail operations on the Caltrain corridor at speeds up to 110 mph. High-
                                                     R

speed rail construction and operations would be the subject of a later, separate environmental
analysis to be conducted by CHSRA and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).

5 Traffic Operational Analysis

This section describes the existing intersection and roadway traffic operating conditions at the
at-grade roadway crossings of the railroad, within the limits of the City of Palo Alto.

5.1       Vehicular Level of Service Methodology and Standards
Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative description of vehicular traffic operating conditions
ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed
conditions with excessive delays. The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)
Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines dictate the use of the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology to analyze intersections. The City of Palo Alto uses the
same methodology to evaluate its intersections. The 2000 HCM operations method evaluates
signalized intersection operations based on average control delay time for all vehicles at the
intersection.

Consistent with operations analysis software used in prior planning studies prepared for the
railroad corridor (such as the Peninsula Corridor Electrification Plan Environmental Impact
Report, Transportation Chapter, 2015) this study utilized Synchro/SimTraffic 8 software based
implementation of the more current 2010 HCM methods for purposes of quantifying traffic
                                               FT
operating conditions at the study intersections. Note that the Synchro/SimTraffic software is a
widely-recognized software (including by agencies such as Caltrans) that is relatively more
reliable for purposes of assessing operational characteristics of closely spaced intersections,
including signalized intersections located in close proximity to at-grade railroad crossings.
                                              A
The City of Palo Alto LOS standard for signalized non-CMP intersections is LOS D or better. For
CMP intersections, the City’s LOS standard is LOS E or better, meaning that only LOS F is
                                              R

considered unacceptable. The exception is the intersection of Foothill Expressway and Page
Mill Road, which has a grade of LOS F and is considered acceptable by VTA. This is because it
has operated at LOS F in the 1991 baseline conditions and thus the City of Palo Alto has not
                                       D


adopted the CMP standards for that particular intersection.

The LOS definitions for signalized intersections are shown in table 5 , . Motor vehicle level of
service D and E are typical at intersections in many urban areas where a high volume of
vehicles pass through an intersection that is physically constrained by existing adjacent
structures.

            Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive
  A         during the green phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle           10.0 or less      0 – 10
            length may also contribute to the very low vehicle delay.
            Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or
  B         short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than LOS A, causing          10.1 to 20.0     > 10 – 15
            higher levels of average vehicle delay.
            Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or
            longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to
  C         appear at this level. The number of vehicles stopping is             20.1 to 35.0     > 15 – 25
            significant, though may still pass through the intersection
            without stopping.
            The influence of congestion become more noticeable. Longer
            delays may result from the same combination of unfavorable
  D                                                                              35.1 to 55.0     > 25 – 35
            signal progression, long cycle lengths, or high V/C ratios. Many
            vehicle stops and individual cycle failures are not noticeable.
            This is considered the limit of acceptable delay. These high
            delay values generally indicate poor signal progression, long
  E                                                                              55.1 to 80.0     > 35 – 50
            cycle lengths and high V/C ratios. Individual cycle failures occur
            frequently.
            This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers.
            This condition often occurs without oversaturation, that is, when
  F                                                       FT
            arrival flow rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. Poor
            progression and long cycle lengths may also be major
            contributing causes of such delay levels.

The LOS descriptions in table 5 are framed entirely from the perspective of motor vehicle
drivers and their passengers. VTA’s Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) Guidelines require the
consideration of other modes of travel when recommending changes to improve an

intersection’s motor vehicle level of service. Senate Bill 743 created a process to change the
way that transportation impacts are analyzed under CEQA and requires an alternative LOS for
evaluating transportation impacts. This is described in further detail in Appendix A — Federal,

State and Regional Policy and Framework Review.

5.2       Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact at an intersection. The City
of Palo Alto uses the same impact criteria as the CMP. A project is deemed to create a
significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection in the City of Palo
Alto if for either peak hour:

    a. the level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable level of service (LOS
       D or better for non-CMP intersections, and LOS E or better for CMP intersections) to an
       unacceptable level of service; and
    b. the intersection is already operating at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E or F for
       non-CMP intersections and LOS F for CMP intersections), and the project causes both
       the average control delay for the critical movements at the intersection to increase by four
       or more seconds and the critical volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by one
       percent (0.01) or more.
For both CMP and non-CMP intersections, if an intersection is operating at an unacceptable
level of service and the change in critical delay is negative (i.e., decreases), a significant impact




                                                                                                               36

is said to occur if the project causes the V/C ratio to increase by 0.01 or more. This can occur if
the critical movements at an intersection change.

5.3         Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis Criteria
A traffic signal warrant analysis was also completed per criteria contained in the California
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA-MUTCD, 2014 Edition, Chapter 4C). The peak-
hour volume Warrant 3 (urban areas) analysis was completed as a representative warrant
analysis to determine if “significance” should be associated with unsignalized operations. Other
signal warrant criteria, including Warrant 9: Intersection Near a Grade Crossing, will also be
evaluated for key study intersections where applicable. Note that the CA-MUTCD indicates that
“the satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant or warrants shall not in itself require the installation of
a traffic control signal.”

5.4         Traffic Count Data
Intersection turning movement and vehicular traffic volume counts were collected by the City on
Thursday, February 16, and November 30, 2017, under AM peak hour, mid-day peak hour, and
PM peak hour conditions, at key study intersections along each of the at-grade crossing
corridors. For the purposes of this study, AM peak hour is defined as one hour of peak traffic
flow between 7:30 and 9:30 AM on a typical weekday, mid-day peak hour is defined as one hour
of peak traffic flow between 2:30 and 4:30 PM on a typical weekday, and PM peak hour is
                                                  FT
defined as one hour of peak traffic flow between 4:30 and 6:30 PM on a typical weekday.

The intersection traffic counts were obtained at a total of thirteen (13) study intersections listed
as follows:
                                                 A

Appendix C – Traffic Count Raw Data contains the raw traffic count data. For a graphical
illustration of the existing traffic volumes at the study intersections, refer to Appendix D –
Existing Traffic Turning Volumes.

5.4.1         Intersection Traffic Operations
The Existing Conditions delay and LOS operations for study intersections for both survey data
sets are summarized in Table 5-2. Note that this table summarizes traffic operating conditions
under normal/typical operating conditions within the typical weekday AM, midday and PM peak
hour periods at the study intersections when the railroad gates are “open”, meaning there is no
railroad-related interruption of vehicular traffic flow on the roadway crossings. There was a
possibility of some bias in the February traffic behavior and volume suggesting it was an

atypical day. To verify this, the traffic counting exercise was repeated at the same locations on
November 30, 2017.
In Table 5-3 and Table 5-4, the differences between the February data set and the November
data set are set out in summary for the key intersections.
The individual movement difference for the 13 intersections for both data sets are included in
Appendix D.
There could be a number of reasons for the differences. Firstly, there may have been a bias in
the demand volumes in the February data, that in general show lower values than the
November demand volumes. Secondly, with continued economic growth in this area, there may
have been some growth in traffic demand between February and November during 2017.
The PM peak hour, however, shows an overall 9.6% greater difference in volumes which tends
to suggest a higher demand than either a normal daily variation or nine (9) months of demand
growth would generate.

It was therefore decided that the November 2017 data set was a better representation of
average week day traffic conditions in the City of Palo Alto. This was then used as the primary
observed data set in all the analyses.

Reviewing the results of the operational analyses in Table 5-2 for the key intersections (i.e.,
                                                        FT
Alma Street with the rail crossing streets), shows that in terms of level-of-service the AM and
PM peak hour drops from C to D, for Meadow Drive, but remain the same for all other
intersections.

Intersection Operations during Railroad-Related Signal Pre-emption Cycles:
                                                       A
In Section 5.4.1 and Table 5-2, the road traffic signal operations are described that relate to the
times when the rail gate is open
                                                R

The relationships between traffic volumes; traffic delays and queues and rail gate closure
frequencies is a complex one. A description of the characteristics is set out below.
                                       D


The Caltrain schedule shows a morning highest peak of 10 trains an hour stopping at Palo Alto
Station two way, stopping between 7:00 am and 8:00 am; but six (6) stopping between 6:00 am
and 7:00 am and five (5) between 9:00 am and 10:00 am.

For the evening peak again there are 10 trains scheduled between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm; but
seven (7) between both 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm and 8:00 pm.

The number of trains stopping at Palo Alto Station does not necessarily directly correlate with
the number of gate closures as some single gate closures may accommodate a train in each
direction. There are also trains that do not stop but pass through and cause rail gate closures.
The best data source on gate closures came from the document “Caltrain: Grade Crossing
Hazard Analysis – Final Report,” February 2016. The data showed all rail gate closures by time
of day and duration for an average weekday. This shows a maximum number in any one hour
of 10 in both the morning and evening peaks, but the average for the four (4)-hour peak periods
is six (6) for the AM and seven (7) for the PM.

The most congestion is caused when both the frequency of gate closures and traffic volumes
peak at the same time. However, in Table 5-5, a comparison of peak traffic flow times with peak
gate closure frequency is set out. What is clear is that although some “peaks” of both the




                                                                                                      39

frequencies of gate closures and traffic volumes do coincide in time, many do not. Nor do the
peak times coincide by location.

Table 5-5 shows the peak hours for traffic flow crossing the Caltrain tracks and the peak hours
for the frequency of gate closures. As can be seen, these vary by each item and location.
Figure 5-1 depicts the situation at the Palo Alto Avenue rail crossing for westbound traffic. The
blue line represents the frequency of gate closures; the green line the traffic volumes and the
red line the length of highest queuing. These are normalized to compare these profiles. What
can be seen is that when traffic volume and gate closure frequencies peak together, so does the
queue length.

Coincidence of “peaking” is evident in the PM peak period, although even then not exactly
(actual peak traffic demand is an hour earlier than peak gate closure frequency). However, it
can be seen that in the AM peak period, the queues at 8:00 am are less than those at 12:00 pm.
This is largely because the traffic demand is the dominant independent variable and is lower at
8:00 am than from 11:00 am onwards.

In order to capture the impacts of all these different variations, the model takes an average
condition over a four (4)-hour peak period from both AM and PM. The model is used to assess
growth in demand and likely traffic diversion effects.

For the more detailed hourly intersection operational analyses, an assumption of eight (8)
railgate closures an hour is used. It is general practice not to design infrastructure to the very
highest peak demand conditions but to normalize peak period conditions for design and
evaluation purposes.

In Table 5-6 the level-of-service for the actual rail crossing movements is shown for 2017. This
is a “weighted” average of times when the rail gates are closed and when they are open.

This shows that the crossings are currently subject to poor levels-of-service and generate
congestion within the road network.

5.4.2         Roadway Traffic Counts and Traffic Operations
The City of Palo Alto provided roadway traffic counts collected from Thursday, February 23,
2017 through Sunday, February 26, 2017 for the following four at-grade roadway crossing
segments:

● Charleston Road west of Alma Street
● Churchill Avenue west of Alma Street
● Meadow Drive west of Alma Street
● Palo Alto Avenue west of Alma Street
                                                           FT
The count data included continuous 24-hour bi-directional counts recorded at 15-minute
intervals. FHWA-definitions based axle-classified count data were also provided for Palo Alto
Avenue, Churchill Avenue, and Meadow Drive segments.

For the purposes of this report, vehicle classes 5 through 7 are considered light trucks and
vehicle classes 8 through 13 are considered heavy trucks in Tables 5-7, 5-8, 5-9, and 5-10,
which depict average weekday and average weekend vehicle counts by type. Vehicle count
data by type was not available for the Charleston Road segment west of Alma Street (Table
5-10). Meadow Drive showed the highest rate of truck traffic out of the three (3) available data
sets of vehicle type counts despite not having the highest vehicle volume out of the three (3)
intersections. Heavy trucks are not permitted on Churchill Avenue, which shows the lowest rate
of truck volumes.

5.4.3           Roadway Intersection Collision Data
For study intersections along Alma Street, roadway collision data from the Statewide Integrated
Traffic Records System (SWITRS) database was compiled and provided by the City of Palo
Alto. The SWITRS is a statewide database maintained by the California Highway Patrol (CHP)
that collects and processes accident data for use by local and state agencies throughout the
state.7 Table 5-11: Study Area Intersection Roadway Collision Data 2011-2015 summarizes the
most recent collision reports from 2011 to 2015. While Palo Alto Avenue experiences relatively
high traffic volume, it shows the least number of collisions out of the four intersections.

7 Bicycle and Pedestrian Network

7.1       Overview
In the 2000s, the City of Palo Alto released the 2003 Bicycle Transportation Plan, improvements
through the Safe Routes to School program, and land use planning reforms, which all
encouraged the creation of a bicycle and pedestrian friendly built environment. The existing
Bicycle and Pedestrian network in the City is largely based on of the recommendations of the
2012 City of Palo Alto Bicycle + Pedestrian Transportation Plan.

The existing bicycle network in the Study Area is shown in Figure 7-1. All four at-grade
crossings are currently connected to roadways with bike lanes.

7.2       2012 City of Palo Alto Bicycle + Pedestrian Transportation Plan
The 2012 City of Palo Alto Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan (BPTP) updates the
initiatives outlined in the 2003 Bicycle Transportation Plan and provides strategic guidance to
the public and private non-motorized transportation investment in facilities and related
programs. The Palo Alto BPTP not only reaffirms city-wide goals of increasing pedestrian and
bicycle usage over the next decade (see Table 7-1), it also takes into account relevant City
plans, surrounding community plans, and state and regional bicycle and pedestrian plans to
create a larger picture.

The Palo Alto BPTP includes five key objectives which are extensions of the transportation
element of the City of Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan, to provide a focus on non-motorized

transportation modes. Each objective includes its rationale, consistency with the
Comprehensive Plan, key strategies of implementation and benchmarks to measure progress.

       Table 7-1: City of Palo Alto Bicycle + Pedestrian Transportation Plan Objectives
Objectives
1. Double the rate of bicycling for both local and total work commutes by 2020 (to 15% and 5%, respectively).
2. Convert discretionary vehicle trips into walking and bicycling trips in order to reduce City transportation-related
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 15% by 2020.
3. Develop a core network of shared paths, bikeways, and traffic-calmed streets that connects business and
residential districts, schools, parks, and open spaces to promote healthy, active living.
4. Plan, construct, and maintain ‘Complete Streets’ that are safe and accessible to all modes and people of all ages
and abilities.
5. Promote efficient, sustainable, and creative use of limited public resources through integrated design and
planning.

7.3       Safe Routes to Schools
The Safe Routes to Schools program is a collaborative effort between the City of Palo Alto and
the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD), with the goal to improve safety for school
commuters and to reduce school commute-related congestion on city streets. Approximately 14
percent of Palo Alto’s students walk to school daily, while 4,000 students from the PAUSD bike
                                                           FT
to school. The Safe Routes to Schools program produced a series of Walk and Roll maps that
outline suggested bicycle and pedestrian paths around a one-mile radius around a school within
PAUSD, as described in Section 2.1.5.

7.4       Bicycle Facilities
The Palo Alto Caltrain Station has had a Bikestation since 2007 which utilizes a former baggage
                                                 R

building at the historical train depot. Bikestations offer 24-hour indoor, secure bike parking
facilities. Some locations include restrooms, showers, and/or changing rooms and repair and
rental services. The Palo Alto Bikestation provides bicycle parking for 96 bikes, recreational
                                       D


rentals, bike repairs, accessory sales, a changing room, and an outdoor seating area with
concessions.

The Palo Alto Caltrain Station also has bikeshare, provided by Bay Area BikeShare. This is a
shared use service for passengers who wish to travel short distances with a bike. Bicycles can
be rented from this station and returned to another BikeShare dock within the area. This
program will soon transition into Ford GoBike, which is set to launch June 2017. The San
Antonio Caltrain Station is also a bikeshare station.

In addition, the three Caltrain stations in Palo Alto provide ample bicycle racks and locker
spaces (detailed in Table 7-2: Bicycle Facilities) which can be rented and reserved in advance.
The locker spaces at Palo Alto and California Ave Caltrain Stations are typically fully reserved.

Appendix A — Federal, State and Regional
 Policy and Framework Review

Federal
          Americans with Disabilities Act
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 provides comprehensive rights and
protections to individuals with disabilities. The goal of the ADA is to assure equality of
opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for people with
disabilities. To implement this goal, the US Access Board, an independent federal agency
created in 1973 to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities, has created accessibility
guidelines for public rights-of-way. While these guidelines have not been formally adopted, they
have been widely followed by jurisdictions and agencies nationwide in the last decade. The
guidelines, last revised in July 2011, address various issues, including roadway design
practices, slope and terrain issues, and pedestrian access to streets, sidewalks, curb ramps,
street furnishings, pedestrian signals, parking, and other components of public rights-of-way.
                                                            FT
These guidelines would apply to proposed roadways in Palo Alto.

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) was created by the Department of Transportation
Act of 1966. The FRA’s mission is to enable the safe, reliable, and efficient movement of people
and goods for a strong America, now and in the future. In 2008, Congress required Class I
railroad main lines handling hazardous materials and railroad main lines with regularly
scheduled intercity and commuter rail passenger service to fully implement Positive Train
Control (PTC) by December 31, 2015. PTC uses communication-based/processor-based train
control technology that provides a system capable of reliably and functionally preventing train-
to-train collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into established work zone limits, and the
movement of a train through a main line switch in the wrong position. The deadline was
extended to December 31, 2018, with the possibility for two additional years if certain
requirements are met. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (Caltrain) is slated to
reaching full PTC implementation by the end of 2017.8 The PTC implementation status as of
December 2016 for PCJPB is shown in Figure 0-1.

Originally passed in 2008, California’s Complete Streets Act came into force in 2011 and
requires local jurisdictions to plan for land use transportation policies that reflect a “complete
streets” approach to mobility as a result of Assembly Bill 1358. The Complete Streets approach
is essentially a suite of policies and street design guidelines which provide for the needs of all

          California Department of Transportation
The California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, is the primary State agency
responsible for transportation issues. One of its duties is the construction and maintenance of
the state highway system. Caltrans approves the planning, design, and construction of
improvements for all State-controlled facilities including I-280, US 101, and the associated
interchanges for these facilities located in Palo Alto. Caltrans’ jurisdiction includes State Route
82 (SR 82), El Camino Real, in Palo Alto. Caltrans has established standards for roadway traffic
flow and developed procedures to determine if state-controlled facilities require improvements.
For projects that may physically affect facilities under its administration, Caltrans requires
encroachment permits before any construction work may be undertaken. For projects that would

             LEVEL OF SERVICE TARGET. Caltrans maintains a minimum level of service (LOS) at
              the transition between LOS C and LOS D for all of its facilities. Where an existing facility
              is operating at less than the LOS C/D threshold, the existing measure of effectiveness
              should be maintained.

            California Public Utilities Commission
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) serves the public interest by protecting
                                        D


consumers and ensuring the provision of safe, reliable utility service and infrastructure. The
CPUC regulates utility services, stimulates innovation, and promotes competitive markets,
where possible, in the communications, energy, transportation, and water industries. In addition,
the CPUC administers funding programs for railroad crossings: Section 130, Section 190, and
Maintenance Fund.

The Section 130 Grade Crossing Hazard Elimination Program provides federal funds to local
agencies (cities and counties) and railroads to eliminate hazards at existing at-grade public
highway-rail crossings.

The Section 190 Grade Separation Program provides state funds to local agencies to grade-
separate at-grade crossings, or to improve grade-separated crossings. The program typically
provides approximately $15 million distributed among three or four projects each fiscal year.10
Eligible projects include the alteration or reconstruction of existing separations and the
construction of new grade separations to eliminate existing grade crossings.

The Railroad Crossing Automatic Warning Device Maintenance Fund provides funds to
railroads to pay for the local government’s share of the costs of maintaining automatic warning
devices at railroad crossings.

       California Transportation Commission
The California Transportation Commission (CTC) administers the public decision-making
process that sets priorities and funds projects envisioned in long-range transportation plans.
The CTC’s programming includes the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), a
multi-year capital improvement program of transportation projects on and off the State highway
system, funded with revenues from the state highway account and other funding sources. The
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) manages the operation of state highways.

       Senate Bill 743 (Steinberg, 2013)
Senate Bill 743 (SB 743) requires the California Governor’s Office of Planning and Research
(OPR) to amend the CEQA Guidelines to provide an alternative to LOS as the metric for
evaluating transportation impacts under CEQA. Particularly within areas served by transit, the
alternative criteria must promote the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
development of multimodal transportation networks, and diversity of land uses. Measurements
of transportation impacts may include VMT, VMT per capita, automobile trip generation rates, or
                                               FT
automobile trips generated. Once alternative criteria are incorporated into the CEQA Guidelines,
auto delay will no longer be considered a significant impact under CEQA. SB 743 also amended
State congestion management law to allow cities and counties to opt out of LOS standards in
certain infill areas.

governments as a result of state legislation that would have supplanted local control over all
bridges, ports, and transit operations in the Bay Area. ABAG provides planning and research
resources related to land use, housing, environmental and water resource protection, disaster
resilience, energy efficiency and hazardous waste mitigation, risk management, financial
services and staff training to local cities, and towns. ABAG's planning and research programs
are committed to addressing sustainability, resilience and equity in the region.

       Metropolitan Transportation Commission
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is the transportation planning, coordinating,
and financing agency for the nine-county Bay Area, including Santa Clara County. It also
functions as the federally mandated metropolitan planning organization (MPO) for the region. It
is responsible for regularly updating the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), a comprehensive
blueprint for the development of mass transit, highway, airport, seaport, railroad, bicycle, and
pedestrian facilities. With the passage of Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the Global Warming Solutions
Act of 2006, the State of California committed itself to reducing statewide GHG emissions to
1990 levels by 2020. Subsequent to adoption of AB 32, the State adopted Senate Bill 375 (SB
375) as the means for achieving regional transportation-related GHG targets. Among the
requirements of SB 375 is the adoption of targets to be met by 2020 and 2035 for each MPO in




                                                                                                   57

the State, as well as the creation of a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) that provides a
plan for meeting regional targets. The SCS and the RTP must be consistent with one other,
including action items and financing decisions. MPOs must use transportation and air emissions
modeling techniques consistent with guidelines prepared by the State CTC.

The current RTP, Plan Bay Area: Strategy for a Sustainable Region, was adopted on July 18,
2013 and includes both the region’s Sustainable Communities Strategy and the 2040 Regional
Transportation Plan. Plan Bay Area was prepared by MTC in partnership with the Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and cities and counties throughout the region. Plan Bay Area is
an integrated long-range transportation and land-use/housing plan intended to support a
growing economy, provide more housing and transportation choices, and reduce transportation-
related pollution in the Bay Area. It also specifies a detailed set of investments and strategies to
maintain, manage, and improve the region’s transportation system, specifying how anticipated
federal, State, and local transportation funds will be spent.

The MTC has established its policy on Complete Streets in the Bay Area. The policy states that
projects funded all, or in part, with regional funds (e.g., federal, State Transportation
Improvement Program, bridge tolls) must consider the accommodation of bicycle and pedestrian
facilities, as described in Caltrans Deputy Directive 64. These recommendations do not replace
                                               FT
locally adopted policies regarding transportation planning, design, and construction. Instead,
these recommendations facilitate the accommodation of pedestrians, including wheelchair
users, and bicyclists into all projects where bicycle and pedestrian travel is consistent with
current adopted regional and local plans.

RTP. In Santa Clara County, the VTA is the Congestion Management Agency (CMA) tasked
with preparing the Congestion Management Plan (CMP) that describes the strategies to
address congestion problems and monitoring compliance. The VTA works cooperatively with
the MTC, transit agencies, local governments, the Caltrans and the BAAQMD. The CMP
contains LOS standards for highways and arterials, multimodal performance standards, a
capital improvement program, a program for analyzing land use decisions, and a travel demand
management (TDM) program.

The minimum LOS standard for VTA-monitored CMP intersections is LOS E, except for facilities
grandfathered in at LOS F, which states that intersections operating at LOS F at the baseline
year for implementation of an LOS standard can be grandfathered in. The standards for Santa
Clara County were established in October of 1991; thus, any intersection operating at LOS F
prior to the established 1991 LOS standards are not held to the minimum standard of LOS E.3
Member Agencies, which include the cities and County of Santa Clara, must ensure that CMP
roadways operate at or better than the minimum LOS standard. The VTA monitors the
performance of CMP facilities at a minimum of every two years. If the minimum LOS standards
are not met, Member Agencies plan for improvements to address the congestion. Palo Alto uses
a minimum LOS standard of LOS D for its intersections not monitored as part of the VTA CPM
program.
                                               FT
To manage the transportation system and monitor performance in relation to established LOS
standards, the VTA has designated a CMP roadway system for Santa Clara County. The CMP
roadway system contains 434.5 miles of roadways, of which: 267.4 miles (61 percent) are State
highways, 58.7 miles (14 percent) are expressways, and 108.4 miles (25 percent) are
                                              A
city/county arterials.5 If adopted standards are not being maintained on a specific roadway in
the designated system, actions must be taken to address problems on that facility or plans must

       Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority Bicycle Program
In 1998, the VTA implemented a comprehensive Bicycle Program to improve the bicycle
infrastructure throughout the Santa Clara County, and to encourage people to utilize biking as a
form of commute and recreation. The Bicycle Program provides facilities, services, and
programs to make provide bikes a safer option for residents and visitors in Santa Clara County.
Under the Bicycle Program, the VTA prepared a Countywide Bicycle Plan, and associated
Bicycle Technical Guidelines.

       Santa Clara County
Bicycle Plan
In 2008, VTA completed the Santa Clara Countywide Bicycle Plan (SCCBP), which provided a
foundation for maintaining and enhancing the countywide bicycle network. The vision of the
SCCBP is: To establish, protect and enhance bicycling as a viable transportation mode and to
assure that bicycling is a practical and safe mode of travel, by itself and in combination with
other modes. The SCCBP identifies existing and proposed cross county bicycle corridors,
some which pass through Palo Alto, such as the Dumbarton East-West Connector Corridor,
which stretches from North Palo Alto to Los Altos, and the Matadero Creek/Page Mill Trail,

which stretches from the southeast corner of the Foothill Expressway/Page Mill Road
intersection along Page Mill Road to Arastradero Road. The SCCBP establishes several goals,
and policies to achieve the vision through transportation planning and programming, land use
and transportation integration, local ordinance and guidelines development, and design and
construction. The VTA’s Bicycle Expenditure Program (BEP) was created to provide a funding
stream to implement the SCCBP.

Santa Clara County Bicycle Technical Guidelines
The VTA Bicycle Technical Guidelines (BTG) establish standards and guidance for planning,
designing, operating, retrofitting and maintaining roadways and bikeways throughout Santa
Clara County, including parts of Palo Alto. The BTGs are intended to improve the quality of
bicycle facilities and to ensure countywide consistency in the design and construction of the
countywide bicycle network, including roadways. The BTGs apply to projects that are a part of
the countywide bicycle network. The BTGs are divided into the following four parts:

Part 1 provides an introduction and general guidance, including purpose and policy guidance, as
well as bicycle characteristics, such as bicyclist skill levels and facilities that best accommodate
them.
Part 2 includes the technical guidelines for roadways, including roadway design elements,
construction zones and maintenance, intersections and interchanges, and signalized
intersections.

1 Introduction

The City of Palo Alto Travel Demand model is an essential source of information and part of the
“tool kit” the Consultant will use for the technical analyses of the Task 4: Rail Corridor
Circulation Study, as part of the Consultant’s Rail Program Management Services. Task 4
itemizes a number of subtasks that will be carried out as follows:

● Data Review
● Existing Documents
● Existing Traffic Counts
● Travel Demand Models
● Development Proposals
● Utilities and Right of Way
● Field Observations
● Collision Data
● Grade Crossing Hazards and Gate Downtime
● Evaluation of Alternatives
                                                          FT
This report focuses on the Travel Demand Model. The Travel Demand Model is a regional
model that has been used by the City of Palo Alto (referred to as the “City”) to provide
transportation information on the Comprehensive Plan and other major changes that will impact
transportation. The Travel Demand Model was developed based on the VTA regional travel
                                                         A
demand model using the Cube Voyager program. How the model will be used is described
together with the background setting for the analyses.
                                                R

A description of the model is included together with identifying its limitations and the appropriate
way of integrating the use of the model into the analyses that form a major component of the
overall evaluation studies. The Consultant has reviewed the output of the model at its base year
                                      D


(2014) with newly obtained and other recent traffic volume counts. This provides a measure of
how the model can be used. The proposed analytical methods the consultant intends to use are
discussed.

A second model, a modified version of the original, was then constructed to refine the model
description for the area around the Caltrain crossings using new traffic data. A discussion on
this is also included.




                                                                                                       1

2 Background and Use of the Travel
Demand Model

The Rail Corridor Circulation Study is set up to assess what the effect will be of the alternative
grade separation road/rail designs on the street based traffic. This will include all motorized
vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. This report addresses motorized vehicles only; other modes
are covered elsewhere.

Analyses of the Travel Demand Model reflect automobiles, taxis, road transit (bus and shuttles),
and trucks. The model simulates road traffic patterns and volumes in the road network. It is
responsive to connectivity in the road network and delay-generated-congestion on the road
network. It will simulate the rerouting of traffic to reflect all drivers (apart from fixed rate road
transit services), minimizing their journey times.

For this exercise, only the road traffic assignment model is used. There are other choice models
within the overall modeling framework (mainly location and mode choice), but they are not
considered to be impacted sufficiently by the alternative forms of grade crossings to be reflected
in the analyses.
                                                          FT
The Travel Demand Model is very large (almost 3,000 zones) and is primarily intended to be
used to assess the impact of major changes in land use and transportation infrastructure and
services. For example, a major capacity increase of a freeway or changes in population or
employment in the City and surrounding area. However, the model is quite suitable for
                                                         A
assessing driver’s responses to major changes in road connectivity and delays generated by
congestion. It is also the best tool available for forecasting future growth in travel demand.

The Consultant will use the Travel Demand Model for two important elements of the analysis.
                                                R

First, it will be used to assess the rerouting of drivers to respond to connectivity changes by
either grade separations or road closures replacing current at grade crossing, for example. This
                                      D


will allow the impact of rerouting to be analyzed with the alternatives being tested. The second
use will be to assess the most likely growth of travel demand and its impact in the future years
at the key points in the road network. This growth will be applied to observed traffic volumes and
movements to project to a future year estimation of traffic conditions.

At the key intersection and grade crossings, a more detailed approach will be applied. New data
has been obtained from recent traffic counts and this data, along with the use of forecast growth
parameters, will be used as input to a more detailed modeling of the intersections. This is
described further in in the following sections of the report.




                                                                                                        2

3 Model Review

Although the model geographically covers the whole Bay Area (nine counties), its focused area
is the City of Palo Alto, where it has more detailed information about the roadway network and
land use. The City model has 2,980 traffic analysis zones (TAZs). The zones are denser in the
City area than in other areas. The base year of the model is 2014, and the planning horizon
year is 2030. Figure 1 below shows the TAZs for the City of Palo Alto.

3.1 Travel Demand Models
Two models were received from Hexagon Transportation Consultants, who currently maintains
the City model:

● 2014 base year model
● 2030 Alt 1 model. This is one of the many future year models of the City. The City has a
  number of future year models, each representing a different planning scenario. The 2030 Alt
  1 model is considered the most appropriate for this study, as it represents the currently
  approved City Comprehensive Plan.
The City model has a number of traffic forecasting periods: AM peak 4-Hour, PM peak 4-Hour,
Mid-Day, and Night. In this study, only the peak hour traffic forecasts will be used, as those
represent the most critical conditions. The City model, however, does not produce peak hour
traffic directly. The peak hour forecasts have to be derived through factoring the AM 4-Hour and
PM 4-Hour traffic forecasts. The same process will be followed for forecasting peak hour traffic
in this study, as would be done for other infrastructure projects in the City.

3.2      Limitations of the Model
The City model is not an intersection based model in the sense that turning movement delay is
not explicitly modeled and is not sensitive to volume changes. The model is not intended to
address this level of detail. From the traffic operation point of view, this is a limitation of the
                                                          FT
model because in urban streets, traffic delay is typically incurred at intersections instead of the
link level. This model uses speed/flow relationships with implicit (average) delays for
intersections.
                                                         A
3.3      Roadway Network in the Study Area
The City model is not built on a GIS network. It therefore lacks many roadway network details in
                                                R

the study area. This is illustrated in Figure 2, where the thick blue lines represent the model
network while the gray lines represent the GIS network. It can be seen from the figure that there
are many streets that are not included in the model. The missing of those local streets, and the
                                      D


fact that not all local streets are represented, may affect how traffic is assigned or routed in the
model. This is completely normal for a strategic model covering the size of area that it does.
Therefore, the model forecasts need to be examined on how they can be used for traffic
operations analysis.

3.4      Study Intersections
This project has four (4) key study intersections / railway and highway crossings. In the following
section, the actual layout of these intersections is compared with what has been assumed in the
model. Aerial photos are used to show the actual layouts of these intersections. From north to
south the intersections are:

1. Palo Alto Ave with El Camino Real
2. Churchill Ave with Alma Street
3. Meadow Drive with Alma Street
4. Charleston Rd with Alma Street
Alma street is a four (4) lane arterial throughout the City and a main north-south route alongside
and immediately to the east of the Caltrain tracks. The intersecting streets have an east-west
orientation and are four (4) lanes in width.

3.5      Model Results Validation
The purpose of the model validation is to better understand the capacity of the model in
forecasting traffic at the corridor level in the study area, as well as the proper use of the model
forecast for traffic operations analysis. The validation is not intended to be a “critique” of the
model but rather to develop how it can be used in the process. The comparison of the modeled
with counted flows is highly unlikely to be the same:

● The model peak hour flows are converted from four (4) peak-hour traffic assignment results,
  whereas the counted flows are true peak hour flows.
● Models of this size are not intended to be used at individual street or intersection level.
● The model does not represent all of the streets in the City.
● Traffic counts can also vary from day to day.
● The model is 2014, and the counts are 2015/16.

The model is validated in two ways. The first is to compare the 2014 traffic forecasts with the
2015/2016 traffic counts. The second way is to compare the 2014 traffic forecast with the 2030
traffic forecasts and check the reasonableness of the volume change, i.e., whether the volume
changes are reasonably explained by the network and land use changes.

3.6      2014 Model Results vs. Traffic Counts
The comparison of the base year traffic forecasts with traffic counts is summarized in Table 1.
The “Counts” column represents the 2015/2016/2017 observed traffic counts, and the “model”
column represents the traffic forecasts from the 2014 base year model (note: the El Camino
Real / Palo Alto Ave intersection traffic counts are from 2017, while those of other intersections
are from 2015/2016). The comparison is conducted for one hour in both the AM and PM peak
periods at the four key study intersections.

* GEH stands for Geoffrey Edward Havers, who developed a statistical method of measuring
the “goodness of fit” between two independent data sets. It is a modified Chi Squared test and
outputs a statistical value for the comparison. It has been adopted by the UK Department of
Transportation, many U.S. State DOTs, and the travel demand modeling industry in general.

A number of observations can be made from the comparison:

● The volume discrepancy between the model forecasts and the traffic counts demonstrates
  that the model should not be used directly to estimate individual traffic flows. The general
  standard is that when the GEH value is greater than 5.0, the data sets are not compatible,
  which was to be expected.
● The model forecasts on Alma Street are generally lower than the observed traffic counts.

Based on the above, it was decided that future year traffic forecasts from the model should not
be used directly for traffic operational analyses at a detailed level and would be used to estimate
the growth in traffic demand. The models would also be used to identify changes in travel
patterns.

3.7      2030 Model Results vs. 2014 Model Results

presented in Table 2.

The comparison shows that:

● The 2030 future year traffic forecasts are systematically higher than the base year forecasts
  along Alma Street. The volume growth incremental rate is roughly 2% annually. This is an
  expected result.
● The cross-street traffic largely increases over time. But at a few locations, the future year
  forecasts are lower than the base year forecasts by a small margin. There are some,
  reassignments in the model that account for this.
The volume change seems to be consistent along Alma Street and the growth rate seems to be
reasonable. The growth shown is quite suitable to be added to traffic forecasts to derive a set of
improved 2030 traffic forecasts.

3.8      The Second Base Year Model
A second base year model was constructed to improve the modeling of traffic flows at the key
intersections on Alma Street.

This model was a refinement of the original City model, using a process called MEOD (Matrix
Estimation of Origins and Destinations), within the CUBE suite of programs. This process
modifies the trip tables to more closely reflect traffic count data that is input to the model.

Below, the methods used to modify the model are described.

     A) Review the road network structure within the model and refine to a more detailed level
        where necessary. To include TAZ link connectors in the review.
     B) Prepare traffic count data and input to the CUBE ANALYST sub-model. The sub-model
        uses a “matrix estimation by maximum entropy” (ME2) process to adjust the trip tables
        to provide, when assigned to the network, the closest fit of model estimated flows to the
        input observed flows.
     C) Rerun base year AM & PM peak models and revalidate, using GEH statistical analyses.

The results are shown in table 3 below.

As can be seen in the table, the degree of model fit to the traffic counts is much improved in the
area of the key Alma Street intersections.

The percentage of GEH statistics that are not greater than five (5) exceeds 85%. The average
GEH statistic is 3.0. The fit at Churchill Ave and Meadow Dr is very good and good at
Charleston Rd. This model may be used for future forecasting for a more precise analysis of the
key intersections of the Caltrain crossing routes with Alma Street.

4 Future Year Modeling Methodology

4.1      Travel Models
The City Travel Demand Models will be used to derive the growth in traffic volumes for all the
traffic operations analyses (TOA). This will be commenced by examining two different time
travel models:

● 2014 base year model. The model approximately represents the existing year condition.
● 2030 Alt 1 model. This model represents one of the City’s most likely future year conditions.
  For this project, this model reflects the no-build condition.
Based on these two models, other models will be constructed to evaluate the future year
“project” conditions. The use of “project” in this instance means any planning or design
measures that are related to this study and to be explored in this study. A number of varying
project conditions will require evaluation. The approach is to add the forecast growth from the
models to the observed traffic volumes:

● Refined traffic forecast = counts + (future year model forecast – base year model forecast).

                                                          FT
The approach is called “The Differences Method” and is described in the National Cooperative
Highway Research Program: Report 765 – Analytical Travel Forecasting Approaches for
Project-Level Planning and Design. The method is described briefly below in the following
Abstract:
                                                         A
“6.3     Factoring Procedure – Difference Method
6.3.1 Abstract
Factoring procedures are used to predict future year turning movements based on the
                                                R

relationship between base year turning movement counts and base year model turning
movement assignments. The assumption is that future turning movements will be similar in
nature to existing turning movements. Based on this assumption, future year turning movements
                                      D


can be estimated by comparing the relative differences between base year and future year
turning movement assignments. The procedure can be applied for both directional and non-
directional turning movements.

6.3.2 Context
Typical applications are intersection design, intersection capacity analysis, site impact studies,
traffic signal timing, and interchange studies.
Geography is site, corridor and wide area.
Typical time horizons are short range, interim, and long range.
Required input data are traffic counts and traffic model link assignments.
Optional input data are turning movement estimates and manual link forecasts.”

This approach was used for the 2030 sample scenario tests.

4.2      Improvement Plans in the Traffic Forecasting Model
Assuming the potential project alternatives in this study are limited to local roadway
improvements such as grade-separation, roadway signing and restriping, or even traffic signal
treatment, these improvements are unlikely to change the overall traffic demand or traffic
distribution pattern at the regional level. These local improvements typically affect only route




                                                                                                     16

choice: if a specific route becomes more attractive, it is going to draw more traffic from adjacent
parallel streets. This is essentially a traffic assignment issue.

It is also assumed that the above roadway improvements change traffic delay at the turning
movement level rather than the link level. For example, grade-separation effectively reduces
signal delays and thereby reduces intersection turning movement delay.

The following steps will be followed to incorporate each roadway improvement into the model:

● Revise the model network to reflect the geometric changes
● Estimate traffic delays due to the increase from four (4) trains each in the peak hour, each
  direction, at current at-grade intersections, to ten trains each direction.
● Estimate the traffic delay as a result of these geometric changes, using traffic operation
  models (Synchro).
● These will then be used to estimate turn penalties in the model at the intersections under
  review.
More details on the methodology and the results of these tests will be contained in the next
section on the Analysis of the Sample Scenarios.

1 Analysis of Sample Scenarios 1-6


1.1      On 28 June 2017, a staff report was presented to the City Council Rail Committee entitled “Draft Rail
         Program Circulation Study Scenarios.” In this Staff Report, six (6) different scenarios were
         recommended for study that were intended to support the identification and evaluation of grade
         separation alternatives. This document reports on the outcomes of those studies and also includes a
         description of the background; the objectives; and the methodologies employed to obtain the results.
1.2      The intent of the Rail Corridor Circulation Study was to estimate the effect on traffic circulation under
         up to eight (8) different scenarios that have been modeled using the regional/Citywide travel demand
         model. This has been used to assess the diversionary (traffic rerouting) impacts of the possible
         changes to the rail corridor road network in the City that future grade crossing layouts may cause. A
         more detailed examination of the intersections at, and close to, the current at-grade crossings has
         also been carried out using traffic operational models. These “Year 2030” scenarios include several
         variations of grade crossings and grade separations at each railroad corridor crossing location. The
         first two scenarios (“Year 2030 No Build Scenario One” and “Year 2030 No Build Scenario Two”) do
         not include any new grade crossings, new grade separations or modifications to existing crossings,
         as they refer to the “No Build” scenarios. The remaining six (6) scenarios (Year 2030 Scenarios 1
                                                     FT
         through 6) include varying collections of new multi-modal grade-separated crossings, new bicycle-
         and-pedestrian-only grade-separated crossings, new grade separations, modified grade crossings,
         and closed grade crossings. The analysis of scenarios is intended to inform the selection of grade
         separations alternatives for more in-depth study and evaluation. These scenarios are for testing only
         and are not intended to establish any policy directions or suppose a preferred alternative.
                                                    A
1.3      The impacts of any future modifications to the current at-grade and grade-separated crossings will
         affect accessibility across the Caltrain tracks. To construct a grade separation where currently there
         is an existing at-grade crossing, clearly reduces the interference or obstruction caused by that
                                           R

         crossing and therefore improves East/West access/capacity at that location. That may or may not
         attract additional vehicular traffic to that crossing. Similarly, closing (i.e., eliminating) an existing at-
         grade crossing will cause traffic to divert to other routes. The intent of this study is to assess
                                  D


         probable changes to motor vehicle and bicycle traffic circulation/demands under changes in
         accessibility/capacity caused by railroad crossing related infrastructure improvement scenarios. To
         the extent that it is possible with the demand models, an order-of-magnitude quantification of those
         changes is described.
1.4      Even if no changes or modifications are made to the existing rail crossings, increases in traffic
         demands driven by land-use and population growth would occur between existing and future (2030)
         conditions. Vehicular traffic is forecast to grow at a little over 1% per year. The Caltrain service
         modifications, made possible by the electrification, are likely to double the number of trains in the
         peak periods compared to now, when they are implemented. There is also the potential for having
         high-speed rail services on this line, in addition to Caltrain. The combination of the increased
         frequency of gate closures at the crossings and increased traffic flows will undoubtedly increase
         road congestion from what it is now.
1.5      Two types of Year 2030 “No Build” scenarios were first defined. A Year 2030 “No Build 1” scenario
         was first developed that includes growth in traffic between current and Year 2030 conditions while
         assuming no change to existing rail service frequencies, and no change in existing roadway
         circulation conditions. Included in the Circulation Study tests, is another Year 2030 “No Build 2”
         scenario where both the increased train frequencies and traffic growth (between existing and year
         2030) are simulated within the demand models, while assuming no future construction occurs. The
         “No Build 2” with both train frequencies and traffic volume scenario forms the ‘baseline’ from which
         comparisons against the scenario tests are made.




                                                                                                                         1

1.6      The current average number of gate closures caused by passing trains is 6-7 per hour over the peak
         periods. The highest number in any one hour recorded is 10. The assumptions within the demand
         modeling is that this will rise to an average of 20 by 2030 if both Caltrain Modernization and high-
         speed-rail services are implemented. Caltrain current signal system headways allow for a maximum
         of an express train every five (5) minutes and a local train every six (6) minutes. This would mean 24
         express trains per hour for both directions if evenly spaced at five-minute intervals and 20 local
         trains per hour if evenly spaced at six-minute intervals. Neither of these conditions would be likely to
         occur in “real life”. Firstly, the service will most likely be a mixture of both local and express trains
         and secondly, running at uniform minimum headways through a peak hour is highly unlikely to be
         achievable in practice. Therefore, by assuming a maximum of 20 gate closures per hour over the
         peak periods, the model is addressing the likely worst-case scenario in terms of traffic disruption.
         It is also likely that with such intense service frequencies, that occasionally, a single-gate closure
         could accommodate two (2) trains passing in opposite directions, meaning that the number of gate
         closures was actually less than the total two-way train frequency.
1.7      Finally, conclusions are drawn from the series of ‘sensitivity’ tests carried out for alternative
         scenarios. It is important to note what is forecast to happen if nothing is done to improve the
         crossings and not only whether diversions will occur under various scenarios of infrastructure
         changes, but whether their impact is likely to be significant or not. The study area is shown in Figure
         1.1.

    2. Study Methods
         2.1       A two-step analysis process was used to complete the circulation study. A large-scale
                   regional/citywide traffic demand model is first used to estimate both the growth in traffic
                   demand within the road network and the diversion impacts that any proposed changes to
                   the road infrastructure will cause. The demand model is fully described in the “Travel Model
                   Validation Report.” Since the regional model cannot simulate traffic flows reliably at an
                   individual roadway link or intersection level, a more refined post-processing of forecasts and
                   operational analysis at an individual intersection level is completed in the second step. This
                   is described below.
         2.2       The Travel Demand Model runs on a “Cube Voyager” software platform. This is a universally
                   accepted platform throughout the planning industry. The model itself comes from the MTC
                   and Santa Clara VTA regional models and is compatible with all models used for
                   infrastructure planning on the Peninsula and the Bay Area. The models are forecast to the
                   future year of 2030 and outputs estimates of traffic volume conditions for the hourly average
                   of a four-hour peak period in both the morning and afternoon for an average week day. Both
                   inputs to and outputs from the Travel Demand Models and the operational models are
                   mounted on the City’s website.
         2.3       The Travel Demand Model is a four-stage model in which trip generation, trip distribution
                   (locations), mode choice (motor vehicle, transit or rail) and assignment (either highway,
                   transit or rail networks) are estimated. The model is calibrated on observations at a base-
                   year against land-use and population data. For future year forecasts to 2030, the main input
                                                     FT
                   to the models are the future year assumptions on the 2030 land uses; populations;
                   employment and car ownership. This is the same model that has been used for developing
                   the transportation elements of the Comprehensive Plan. The model is owned by and is
                   accessible through the City of Palo Alto.
                                                    A
         2.4       This model was used, together with traffic count data, to develop the forecast traffic flows for
                   the sample scenarios. Subsequently a second base year model was developed that
                   incorporated a later set of traffic county data (November 2017) local to the at-grade
                                           R

                   intersections to refine the model focus on these intersections. This is reported in the Existing
                   Conditions and the Travel Model Validation Sections. However, the original model is the one
                   that was used for forecasting to 2030.
                                  D


         2.5       The train frequencies that cause gate closures during the peak periods vary considerably at
                   the crossing locations from three (3) per hour to ten (10) per hour. The highest frequencies
                   tend to be 8:00-9:00 am and 6:00-7:00 pm. The other variable involved is the crossing traffic
                   volume. It is a combination of these two variables that produces congestion. Crossing traffic
                   volume peaks at different times at different location and at different times to the train
                   frequency peaks. For example, at the Palo Alto crossing, westbound traffic peaks between
                   11:00 am and 12:00 pm. At Churchill Rd and E/W Meadow Dr, the afternoon peak hour for
                   eastbound traffic is 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm. So, a single peak-hour demand model would not
                   capture all the peak conditions and would not be fully representative for analysis. By
                   adopting the City’s Demand Model that covers a four-hour peak period for both the AM and
                   PM, the study has encapsulated the dynamic variables that make up traffic congestion.
                   The qualification being that the highest peaks at individual locations could generate more
                   congestion for a short time than the model would predict.
                   A further issue is that of a phenomenon called “peak spreading.” As traffic congestion
                   grows, drivers tend to change their time of travel to avoid the worst conditions. It is traffic
                   saturated conditions that cause “peak spreading” to happen, where the physical capacity of
                   the system is reached. When looking at the possibility of a 20% growth of traffic by the year
                   2030, it is likely that the highest peak traffic volumes could not be accommodated by some
                   parts of the road network capacity. The result would be an expansion of the peak conditions




                                                                                                                  3

                   to a wider time period. By using a four-hour average peak period, this growth can be
                   realistically simulated by the demand model.
                   The analyses of the operational conditions, however, does use current peak hour volumes,
                   with growth added by the demand model to analyze those conditions in the future forecast
                   year of 2030. This means that the operational analyses will have captured the most
                   congested conditions.
         2.6       The individual intersection-level forecasts were developed using Year 2017 intersection
                   turning-volume level ground counts as the basis. Each of the critical intersections that
                   include the rail crossings were surveyed for two (2) days in 2017, (one in February and one
                   in November) with new weekday peak-hour traffic counts obtained at thirteen (13) study
                   intersections. This included the actual rail crossing intersections as well as the closely
                   located and influential adjacent intersections.
         2.7       The traffic count data and forecasts were used as input to a traffic operational modeling
                   procedure to analyze the performance of the intersection. The software platform is
                   Synchro® (Version 8). This is a popular traffic operational analysis software platform that is
                   universally used and accepted throughout North America. This was completed for
                   February’s 2017 data set.
         2.8       The Synchro® analysis was initially used for the 2017 (actual) conditions and reported in the
                   Existing Conditions Report. For the future forecast year of 2030, the 2017 count data was
                   modified/refined to reflect regional-model forecasted growth in traffic demand through year
                                                     FT
                   2030 from year 2017. The impact, as a result of traffic growth, was analyzed with the
                   Synchro® software. The Demand Model was used to estimate that growth. The result is that
                   at individual intersections, the peak one-hour (as opposed to the four-hour average of the
                   peak period) demands are more accurately represented.
                   Two (2) separate appraisals were carried out for the 2017 analyses. The initial one used the
                                                    A
                   February 2017 data and the second one used the November 2017 data. Compared to other
                   data that was available, including the November 2017 counts, it seems likely that there was
                   a bias in the February 2017 data. This was thought to be caused by atypical traffic demand
                                           R

                   and behavior from events being held that were outside normal weekday activities. This is
                   reported in the Existing Conditions Section of this Report.
                                  D


                   It was therefore concluded that the second data set, relating to the November 2017 traffic
                   counts, should be considered as the most realistic. However, the differences from using
                   either of the two (2) data sets in forecasting are unlikely to be significant. The probability is
                   that one level-of-service difference may occur in a minority of cases. Certainly the overall
                   impact analyses are highly unlikely to change.
         2.9       To address the important issue of Bicycle accessibility, a separate analysis procedure was
                   used. This consisted of developing an accessibility map, based on travel time contours (an
                   isochronic analysis), using a GIS-based mapping procedure. This plots the travel distance
                   that can be achieved with 5, 10, 15 and 20-minute cycling times. The process, therefore,
                   easily identifies the ability of bicyclists to make east/west movements across the Caltrain
                   tracks and indicates where there is good and poor accessibility. The average bicycle speed
                   was taken as 12 mph, which is what the City typically uses to time traffic signals along
                   bikeways.

    3. Scenario Specifications
         3.1       Six (6) separate circulation sample scenarios were tested with both the morning (AM) and
                   afternoon (PM) peak period models at a future forecast year of 2030. These are presented
                   in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 describes the six (6) scenarios that are analyzed and Table 2 is a
                   tabular representation of the scenarios.
         3.2       For each at-grade crossing, there are a variety of treatments available.
                   ● Remain as it is today with all-modes having access. (No change)
                   ● Closure for all modes. (Motor vehicles)
                   ● Closure for vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, but retaining Pedestrian and Bicycle access,
                     either remaining at-grade or grade separated.
                   ● Grade separation for all modes.
                   ● Widen existing grade-separated crossings.
                   There are other measures that can also be implemented such as remaining as an at-grade
                   crossing for all modes but imposing a quiet zone. This is not an option that can be analyzed
                   within the modeling procedures in the circulation studies, but is a qualitative assessment in
                   terms of impacts. For the demand model tests, there is no sensitivity to the type of grade
                   separation that may be employed, only that the current obstruction caused by the presence
                   of the rail crossing is removed.

                    Table 1, below, presents a general description of each of the sample scenarios that were
                    tested. All were analyzed for the future forecast year of 2030.
                    Also, to be noted is that where the circulation study assumes grade separations, it does not
                    differentiate between the type of separation (below grade, above grade, etc.). This is due to
                    the focused nature of the analyses and means that additional circulation analysis will likely
                    be needed for grade separation alternatives that emerge through the community process if,
                    for example, the type of separation results in local street closures in the vicinity. It was also
                    assumed that all grade separations included full connections (both turning and through
                    movements) with Alma Street, as it exists today.

      4. Scenario Test Results 1: Traffic Diversions
                                                     FT
         4.1       For the six (6) test scenarios, the travel demand model was used to assess the diversion
                   effects. The model was used to estimate how travel patterns will change when accessibility
                                                    A
                   changes. This shows where increases and decreases occur in traffic volumes when a
                   scenario is compared to the “No Build” scenarios. These are shown graphically in Figures
                   4.1 to 4.12. The “No Build Scenario 1” will include all infrastructure and rail service as it
                                            R

                   exists today (2017) with the forecasted 2030 traffic demand. The “No Build Scenario 2”
                   includes all infrastructure as it exists today, but with the forecasted 2030 traffic demand and
                                    D


                   the increase in the frequency of rail crossing gate closures resulting from proposed Caltrain
                   and High-Speed Rail service.

         4.2       In 2030, the train frequency in the peak periods of the average weekday is forecast to
                   increase to around three times today’s service levels (i.e., from an average of 6-7 trains per
                   hour to 20 trains per hour). This assumes both Caltrain and high-speed rail future forecast
                   services will be operating. It could be speculated that even if high-speed rail is not in service
                   by then, the demand for Caltrain services could push the train frequency to that level. That
                   could be near to a practical saturation level for Caltrain services to operate if no further
                   modifications (such as more passing tracks) are constructed.

                   In simple capacity terms, this translates to approximately a 20% reduction in vehicular
                   capacities across the Caltrain at-grade crossings from today. For both the No-Build Scenario
                   1 and Scenario 2, a 15% increase in total vehicular traffic volumes crossing the rail lines
                   within the City is forecast through Year 2030 over existing conditions.

         4.3       The difference between No Build Scenario 1 and No Build Scenario 2 is that there would be
                   a vehicular traffic rerouting effect for the individual crossings due to the increase in grade-
                   crossing congestion caused by effectively tripling the potential for gate closures. Essentially
                   crossing traffic reduces on Palo Alto Ave; E/W Meadow Dr and Charleston Rd and
                   increases on Oregon Expressway and San Antonio Rd. There is little effect on Churchill




                                                                                                                        7

                   Ave; University Ave and Embarcadero Rd. So, there is a redistribution of routing to the
                   grade-separated crossings in the south of the City.

         4.4       In the rest of the comparisons, the “No Build Scenario 2” option is assumed to be the
                   baseline, so in Figures 4.1 to 4.12, the “traffic differences” diagrams are shown for each
                   scenario against the “No Build Scenario 2”, with the red overlay showing which roads will
                   have increased traffic flows and the green overlay showing where traffic flows will be
                   reduced. For each scenario, a summary of this is included with a description of the effect on
                   the volumes using the various rail crossings within the City.

         4.5       SAMPLE SCENARIO 1

                   Sample Scenario 1 has three (3) of the at-grade crossings closed and Charleston Rd. grade
                   separated. Embarcadero Rd is widened. The total 2030 traffic crossing reduces to 2017
                   levels, so the growth is effectively rerouted out of the City. University Ave and Embarcadero
                   Rd experience small increases but Charleston Rd experiences very high increases in traffic
                   flows, over 50% above the No Build Scenario 2 flows, shown in Figures 4.1 and 4.2.

         4.6       SAMPLE SCENARIO 2

                   Scenario 2 has Palo Alto Ave and Meadow Dr closed; Churchill Ave remaining at grade and
                   Charleston Rd grade separated. The total crossing traffic flows reduce by around 10% from
                   the No Build Scenario 2 conditions, so around 5% above today’s conditions. There is some
                                                     FT
                   small amount of increases to traffic on the grade-separated crossings, with the exception of
                   Charleston Rd which experiences over 50% increase in traffic flow.

                   In the westbound direction, Oregon Expressway is likely to exceed LOS D. In the eastbound
                   direction, Embarcadero Rd is likely to be congested, well above LOS D. University Ave is
                                                    A
                   not likely to exceed LOS D. Shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.4.

        4.7        SAMPLE SCENARIO 3
                                           R

                   Scenario 3 has the existing grade separation at Embarcadero Rd being widened and with
                   Charleston Rd grade separated. There are slight increases for Palo Alto Ave and
                                  D


                   Embarcadero Rd but over a 50% increase from the No Build Scenario 2 for Charleston Rd.

                   The widening of Embarcadero Rd reduces potential congestion and assists in balancing the
                   traffic volumes between the grade-separated crossing. The widening, therefore, is a
                   justifiable measure and serves the purpose for which it is intended. Both Palo Alto Ave and
                   Embarcadero Rd are likely not to exceed LOS D. Shown in Figures 4.5 and 4.6.

         4.8      SAMPLE SCENARIO 4

                   The only change from No Build Scenario 2 to Sample Scenario 4 is that a grade separation
                   for Charleston Road is included. There is little change except for Charleston Rd itself, which
                   attracts over an additional 50% of traffic flow. Shown in Figures 4.7 and 4.8.

         4.9       SAMPLE SCENARIO 5

                   Scenario 5 has an at-grade quiet zone at Palo Alto Ave and grade separations at Charleston
                   Rd and Meadow Dr. Churchill Ave remains at-grade. Both Meadow Dr and Charleston Rd
                   experience a high level of additional traffic flow. This is likely to have the effect of having
                   similar traffic operating conditions as today, on the existing grade separations. So, the traffic
                   growth is taken up by the new grade-separated crossings. Shown in Figures 4.9 and 4.10.




                                                                                                                   8

         4.10      SAMPLE SCENARIO 6

                   This scenario offers the greatest level of total capacity increase for the crossings within the
                   City of all the scenarios tested. It has all the specifications of sample scenario 5 with the
                   addition of widening at Embarcadero Rd and Palo Alto Ave grade separated. Churchill Ave
                   stays the same as today. Each of the former at-grade crossings that are assumed to be
                   grade separated attract substantial additional traffic flows – much of which is diverted from
                   the existing grade-separated crossings in the City. The existing grade-separated crossings
                   operate with similar levels of traffic flow to today and substantially better than in No Build
                   Scenario 2. Shown in Figures 4.11 and 4.12.

         4.11      DISCUSSION ON TRAFFIC DIVERSION OUTCOMES

                   Although six (6) scenarios is only a fraction of the vast number of possible combinations and
                   permutations for different layouts of the crossings in the City, it seems the tests completed
                   provide a reasonable picture of likely outcomes of different scenarios. These range from
                   Sample Scenario 1, the most restrictive, which is specified to close down all the at-grade
                   crossings except Charleston Rd, to Sample Scenario 6, that includes grade separating
                   every crossing that is currently at-grade, except for Churchill Ave.

                   In general, the outcomes of the tests are intuitive with those crossings that remain at grade
                   shedding traffic to either the existing grade-separated crossings or any that will be newly
                   constructed as grade separated. The exception is Churchill Ave which seems relatively
                   insensitive to changes in the layout and functions of the crossings. This may be because
                   Churchill is used for very local trips that are unlikely to reroute without significant
                   inconvenience.

         4.12      If the grade separations were to be constructed, then some rerouting would occur from the
                   existing grade separations. Charleston Rd is particularly likely to experience this if it is grade
                   separated; specifically attracting traffic that currently uses the San Antonio Road grade-
                   separated crossing. Charleston Rd and Arastradero Rd corridor is one of the few connecting
                   routes for I-280 and US 101

                   Sample Scenario 1 is likely to divert the 15% growth in traffic demand from today to 2030,
                   out of the City and divert existing traffic from the routes that are closed to those that are
                   grade separated. This is shown in Figures 4.13 and 4.14.

                   It should be noted that in Figures 4.13 to 4.16 the increases are compared to current
                   conditions, not to the “No Build Scenario 2.” This gives a perspective to the likely increases
                   compared to today.

         4.13      Sample Scenario 6 displays about the highest crossing capacity of the six (6) sample
                   scenarios for vehicular traffic. Churchill Ave is not assumed grade separated, but seems
                                                     FT
                   fairly insensitive to change and may not make any significant difference. Sample Scenario 6
                   is technically equivalent to having the Caltrain track below or above ground for the whole
                   length through the City, from a traffic modeling perspective.

                   This Scenario attracts some 5% more total crossing traffic than No Build Scenario 2. All
                                                    A
                   routes that are currently at-grade and become grade separated in Scenario 6 will attract
                   significant additional volumes of traffic, as can be seen in Figures 4.15 and 4.16. Much of
                                           R

                   this traffic reroutes from existing grade crossings, particularly San Antonio Road.

    5. Scenario Test Results 2: Intersection Analyses

         5.1       GENERAL

                   This section of the report describes the results of a more detailed examination of the
                   operational performance of the intersections. The computer program Synchro® (version 8)
                   was used for the analysis. For each intersection, the traffic flows surveyed in 2017 were
                   used as input with the addition of forecast traffic growth from 2017 to 2030. The growth was
                   estimated using the travel demand model.

                   The forecast traffic flows are described below. This is followed by an analysis of the
                   conditions, in terms of traffic delay and queues, that are likely to occur if the Caltrain
                   services are increased to, firstly, Caltrain modernization specification and secondly, to both
                   the Caltrain Modification and high-speed rail specification for train service frequencies. This
                   section then describes the more detailed analyses that have been carried out for the
                   performance of the intersections under Sample Scenarios 1 to 6. Finally, a discussion is

         5.4       TRAFFIC CONDITIONS FOR “NO BUILD” SCENARIOS
                   Tests were carried out for a number of possible conditions for the future:
                            2017 - current conditions
                            2020 - Caltrain Modernization train frequency increases
                            2030 - Caltrain Modernization and high-speed-rail train frequency increases (No
                                   Build Scenario 2)
                   In Figure 5.2, the average vehicle delays are shown under the three (3) analysis years
                   described above. As can be seen, particularly in the PM peak, delays are forecast to at least
                   double in many cases from 2017 to 2030.
         5.5       Figures 5.3 and 5.4 show the likely queue formation for the future year of 2030 in the PM
                   peak for a “No Build Scenario 2” condition. The PM peak, generally, has higher volume of
                   flows than the AM peak. Queues become a more serious issue when they cause gridlock by
                   backing up through intersections that are up-stream (in traffic flow terms) of the intersection
                   under examination. As can be seen, this occurs at a number of the intersections under
                   review and particularly on El Camino Real, which is a major route through the City.
         5.6       Table 4 below shows the typical level-of-service (LOS) for the key traffic flows that cross the
                   rail track for the three (3) analysis years at each of the at-grade crossings (as set out above

    5.7          TRAFFIC CONDITIONS UNDER SAMPLE SCENARIOS 1-6 AT 2030

                      Table 5 shows a summary of the motor vehicle level-of-service (LOS) for traffic operations at
                      the intersections analyzed on the Caltrain track crossing routes, that are currently at grade
                      as set out in paragraph 5.3 and shown in Figure 5.1. The LOS is for the times when the rail
                      gates are not closed. For the LOS for times when the gates are closed, Table 4 should be
                      referred to. It should be remembered that the forecast flows into the intersections vary
                      considerably between different scenarios and therefore the LOS will also vary. For example,
                      when an existing at-grade crossing is assumed to be grade separated in a scenario, it is
                      likely to attract more traffic, which then can deteriorate the intersection LOS’s on that route.
                      This also means that some routes that remain at-grade will operate at a better LOS during
                      times when the rail crossing gate is open, than when they are assumed to be grade
                      separated. This is usually because traffic is deterred from using a route with an at-grade
                      crossing because of the likelihood of gate closures. When a route that was previously at-
                      grade is proposed for grade-separation, the demand model shows it will attract additional
                      traffic and that additional traffic may cause a deterioration in the operating LOS at the
                      intersections on that route. When future alternative (more detailed) designs for grade
                      operations are carried out, these conditions may well be improved.

           5.8        DISCUSSION ON TRAFFIC OPERATION ANALYSES

                      Under the “No Build Scenario 2” condition which assumes maximum increase in train
                      services from Caltrain and high-speed-rail, all of the at-grade crossings are likely to operate
                      at LOS-F for traffic signal phases during which a rail track gate closure is included. With the
                      forecast frequencies of closures, this will occur on an increasing number of occasions during
                      the peak periods (one every three [3] minutes on average). Conversely, if an at-grade
                      crossing remains at-grade, traffic will likely divert to other routes and this may improve the
                      operating LOS for periods when no gate closures occur.

           5.9        For routes where currently at-grade crossings are converted to grade separations, additional
                      traffic is likely to be attracted which may deteriorate the LOS for all intersections on that
                      route. This can be seen in Table 5; however, where the all mode closures of the rail
                      crossings at Palo Alto Ave; Churchill Ave and Meadow Dr (Scenario 1) are implemented, it
                      may improve the LOS of the surrounding intersections.

                      If closures were to be implemented and traffic diverted to existing grade crossings, then the
                      LOS on Embarcadero Rd and Oregon Expressway are likely to operate higher than LOS D.




                                                                                                                      34
Mott MacDonald | Analysis of Sample Scenarios 1 6

City of Palo Alto: Rail Program Management



                   Without widening, Embarcadero Rd in an eastbound direction would likely be highly
                   congested and above LOS D.

         5.10      A further consideration is that the actual timings of the gate-crossing cannot be predicted
                   precisely. There is a randomness associated with arrival time of the train within a given time
                   period. This is exacerbated by the fact that the services are two-way operations, each
                   direction having their own frequency characteristics. This may mean that on occasions, the
                   traffic queuing from one signal phase that included a gate closure may not sufficiently
                   recover to a normal non-gate closure condition, before another gate-closure phase occurs
                   for the traffic signal. Conversely, opposite direction trains may utilize one gate closure,
                   resulting in more open gate time within a given window.

         5.11      In summary, for those crossing routes that remain at-grade, it is likely that the intersections
                   will operate at LOS F for the times when there is a gate closure. Due to traffic being
                   attracted away from these routes, because of the likelihood of drivers experiencing a gate
                   closure, the traffic volumes on those routes are likely to reduce. This would mean the LOS
                   would improve when no gate closures occurred. However, for the forecast train frequencies
                   in 2030 under the full impact of Caltrain Modernization and high-speed-rail specifications,
                   the likelihood of a traffic signal phase including a gate closure becomes very much higher
                   than today.

                   For those routes that do have future grade separated Caltrain track crossings, where none
                                                     FT
                   exist today, increased traffic flows are likely to occur and thus the LOS at the intersections
                   on that route may deteriorate.



    6. Bicycle & Pedestrian Accessibility
                                                    A
         6.1       As part of the scenario testing, a variety of different proposals for new bicycle and
                   pedestrian crossings for the Caltrain track were prepared. These are shown in Table 6
                                           R

                   below.

                   As part of any future grade-separated crossings, both bicycle and pedestrian facilities will be
                                  D


                   fully accommodated within the overall infrastructure designs. These will be equivalent in
                   access and safety terms to the latest standards and to any of the other newly constructed
                   Bicycle/Pedestrian-only grade separations.

                      The sample scenarios with crossing closures for all modes (1 and 2) if implemented without
                      the provision of pedestrian and bicycle-crossing facilities close by, would seriously
                      deteriorate mobility for those modes of travel. For the No Build Scenario 2 and as it is today,
                      there is a significant gap between Oregon Expressway and Meadow Dr. With Sample
                                                    A
                      Scenario 1, this gap is extended by the closure of Meadow Dr. Added to this, new gaps
                      would appear between Oregon Expressway and Churchill Ave and north of Palo Alto Ave.
                      Sample Scenario 2 is a considerable improvement on Sample Scenario 1 with the addition
                                             R

                      of new Bicycle/Pedestrian-crossing facilities at Everett Ave/Lytton Ave and at Loma Verde

                      crossing and Charleston Rd, by closing Meadow Dr.

         6.3          Sample Scenario 6 provides the maximum accessibility for Bicyclists and Pedestrians of all
                      the scenarios tested. As all at-grade crossings are assumed grade separated, except
                      Churchill Ave, and all proposed new grade-separated crossings for bicycle and pedestrian
                      are assumed constructed, the overall level of accessibility is very high. This is shown in
                      Figure 6.3. The only remaining at-grade crossing that does not have improved Bicycle and
                      Pedestrian crossing facilities would be Churchill Avenue

                     Churchill Ave, Meadow Dr and Charleston Rd all have around the same level of total
                     collisions and injury-related collisions, with one (1) fatality at Charleston Rd. Any new
                     construction to the latest standards, particularly a grade separation or closure, is likely to
                     reduce the potential for accidents.


         8. Summary and Conclusions

         8.1         The Traffic Circulation Study tests were carried out with the City’s Travel Demand Model for
                                                     FT
                     examining the impacts of traffic growth and any traffic diversionary effects from the different
                     layouts and combinations of grade separations. Although the number of permutations and
                     combinations of different forms of treatment to the Caltrain crossings are potentially very
                     high, the six (6) representative tests carried out have provided a reasonable picture of what
                     is likely to happen under the most foreseeable/practical scenarios.
                                                    A
         8.2         Six (6) sample scenarios were tested that ranged from a very restricted accessibility
                     specification to one with a very high level of accessibility across the Caltrain tracks.
                                           R

         8.3         Total growth in traffic across the Caltrain track crossing from now (2017) to 2030 is forecast
                     to be around 15% under “No Build” condition.
                                  D


         8.4         Under a “No Build Scenario 2” condition (i.e., with the expected maximum of 20 trains per
                     hour during peak periods), the increased delays at the at-grade crossings would cause
                     traffic to divert to the currently grade-separated crossings; particularly Oregon Expressway
                     and San Antonio Rd. The conditions on both of these routes is likely to be worse than LOS
                     D.

         8.5         For a situation with the higher level of restricted access (Sample Scenario 1), the test
                     assumed closure of the Palo Alto Ave; Churchill Ave and Meadow Dr at-grade crossings.
                     Charleston Rd was assumed grade separated. For this scenario, the overall 2030 traffic
                     volumes across the Caltrain track within the City would reduce to levels that exist today and
                     the ‘growth’ would be diverted out of the City.

         8.6         Sample Scenarios 1 and 2 would seriously reduce bicycle and pedestrian accessibility
                     across the Caltrain track and, therefore, active transportation mobility in general, unless
                     newly constructed crossings were provided in the same or close-by locations.

         8.7         For the scenarios with a number of grade separations replacing currently at-grade
                     crossings, the total 2030 traffic across the Caltrain tracks could grow by more than 20%
                     from today. This means some traffic is diverted in from outside the City compared to a “No
                     Build” conditions.




                                                                                                                      40

         8.8       In all cases, currently at-grade crossings, if they were to be grade separated, would attract
                   traffic from the existing grade-separated crossings. Charleston Rd and Meadow Dr are likely
                   to attract over 50% increases relative to the No Build Scenario 2 with Palo Alto Ave over
                   30%. Much of the additional traffic would be diverted from the currently grade-separated
                   crossings. This is likely to improve the LOS on all the existing grade-separated crossings.

         8.9       The model shows that the traffic that diverts to be the longer distance traffic, whereby
                   decisions by drivers on changes in routing are made outside the City.

         8.10      The more detailed examination of the individual intersection traffic operations shows that
                   under the forecast “No Build Scenario 2” conditions, the intersection at the rail crossings
                   would be operating at Level-of-Service F on an overall basis and could incur at least twice
                   the delay experienced today.

         8.11      For Caltrain crossing routes within the City that are assumed to remain at-grade, the traffic
                   flow volumes are forecast to experience little change from 2017, and any additional traffic
                   due to growth diverts to those crossings where there are grade separations. Such grade
                   separations may be the existing ones or newly constructed ones. Thus, the traffic
                   operational conditions for the routes that remain at-grade remain similar to today when a
                   gate-closure does not interfere with the signal phasing. However, for the signal phases
                   where a gate closure does impose on the phasing conditions, the motor vehicle level-of-
                   service drops to F. In 2030 with full Caltrain modernization and high-speed rail train pre-


         8.12

                   emptions, this would occur a substantial number of times during the peak periods.

                   For the Caltrain crossing routes within the City that are assumed to be upgraded from at-
                   grade to grade separated, the traffic volumes are likely to increase substantially. This could
                   cause the level-of-service of the individual intersections on the crossing routes, close to the
                                                    A
                   track, to deteriorate.

         8.13      Any complete all-mode closures on the crossing routes will cause substantial reduction in
                                           R

                   mobility to bicyclists and pedestrians unless either an existing grade-separated crossing is
                   close by or a new one is constructed.
                                  D


         8.14      In the period from 2011 to 2015, a total of 88 accident collisions were recorded, of which 32
                   involved injury and one (1) a fatality. New construction, either grade separations or closures,
                   are likely to reduce this substantially.
