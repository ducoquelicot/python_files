Summary Title: PAFD Semi Annual Performance Report FY18

Title: Palo Alto Fire Department Semi-Annual Performance Report for the
First Half of Fiscal Year 2018

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Fire

Recommendation
Staff recommends the City Council review the First Palo Alto Fire Department Semi-
Annual Performance Report for Fiscal Year 2018.

Background and Discussion
In Fiscal Year 2015 the Palo Alto Fire Department (PAFD) identified performance
reporting as a key initiative, and began reporting on key performance measures
quarterly. Beginning Fiscal Year 2018, the Department will be submitting reports twice
each year.

The report provides overall calls for service information, as well as more detailed
information on the key service areas, including Emergency Medical Services, Fire
Suppression, Rescue and Hazardous Materials Response, and Fire Prevention. The
report also provides information on mutual and automatic aid with our regional public
safety partners and internal workforce planning efforts.

Performance measures include the following:

        Calls for Service: This data provides information on the final outcome of all
         emergency response calls. The data is tracked in the Fire Department’s Record
         Management System, and uses standardized call type codes, which are defined
         by the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS). The report includes
         overall call volume by primary category, and a detailed listing of call type in the
         service type sections.

         In Fiscal Year 2018 the Department will be structuring and reporting on calls for
         service based on the NFIRS category groups in order to maintain consistency

         amongst various City performance reports and statistics sent to State and
         National reporting centers.

        Response Times: This aspect measures the time it takes from an emergency call
         or request for response being created in the dispatch center to the arrival of
         resources to the scene of the emergency. This information is tracked in the
         Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and the performance goals, or service
         levels, are set by Council in accordance with county and national standards.

        Ambulance Transports: The report provides the number of ambulatory transports
         to hospitals or other medical care facilities, and the proportion of Emergency
         Medical Calls that included transports. This information is tracked in the Fire
         Department’s Emergency Medical Record Management System.

        Fire Containment: This measures the proportion of building and structure fires
         that are contained to the area or room of origin within Palo Alto and Stanford
         Campus.

        Mutual and Automatic Aid: This includes the number and proportion of all
         incidents in which the PAFD provided aid to neighboring communities, as well as
         the aid received from neighboring Fire Departments. This information is tracked
         in the CAD System.

        Permits: This provides the count of facility, electric vehicle, and solar permits
         issued by the Fire Prevention Bureau. This information is currently tracked in the
         Development Center’s Records Management System.

        Inspections: A count of the total number of Hazardous Materials and State
         Mandated inspections is provided. In addition, an estimated number of
         inspections to be completed for the year is also provided to assess overall
         workload performance to date.

        Fire and Life Safety Plans Reviewed: This provides a total count of all plans
         reviewed, as well as the proportion of plans that were reviewed within the time
         guidelines.

        Vacancies and Off-Line Employees: This section provides the total number of
         budgeted full-time equivalent line personnel, current vacancies, and employees
         that are off line from workers compensation or light duty. This information is
         obtained from the Fire Department’s Staffing and Scheduling System (TeleStaff),
         as well as the City’s Personnel Management System.

        Succession Planning Metrics: This provides the number and proportion of line
         personnel that are eligible to retire, or will be eligible within the next five years.

City of Palo Alto                                                                        Page 2
         This information is tracked in the City’s Personnel Management System. This
         report also provides the total number of hours line personnel have spent in an
         acting capacity. Personnel serving in an acting capacity are a key component of
         the Department’s overall succession planning efforts. Acting capacity allows
         junior officers to learn the responsibilities of higher ranks with guidance from
         senior officers. This information is tracked in TeleStaff.

     Training hours: The total number of training hours completed by all line
      personnel is provided, as well as the average number of hours per each line
      personnel on staff. This information is tracked in the Fire Department’s Record
      Management System. Local, State and Federal mandates require fire personnel
      to train a minimum of 20 hours per month.

Honorable Councilmembers,

I am pleased to provide the enclosed performance report for the first half of Fiscal Year 2018. After a
review of the metrics, methodology and structure of the report as part of the Accreditation process the
Department has made a few adjustments to the report. This includes moving to a semi-annual reporting
frequency, aligning call type categories to mirror the National Fire Incident Report System categories,
and improved tracking and methodologies.

Another important item of note is that this period reflects staffing and deployment levels prior to the
recent changes that were made effective in January 2018. Since January, Fire Command Staff has
frequently reviewed workload and performance. Preliminarily, the new deployment is performing as
planned including the even distribution of calls among crews and handling nearly every ambulance call.
More importantly, system performance remains consistent.

Turning to the events over these six months, the State faced the most difficult wildland fire season on
record. The City of Palo Alto Firefighters did some of their best work to help protect life and property,
minimize the damage and assist victims. There were five significant state fires this season, two of which
were record breaking in their size and amount of destruction.

In July, Palo Alto Fire supported the Detwiler Fire in Mariposa County. The fire grew to over 80,000 acres
prior to full containment and took over one month to contain. Palo Alto crews spent seven days of
uninterrupted firefighting to assist in the containment efforts.

In late August, Palo Alto Fire deployed to the Helena Fire in Trinity County for a ten day commitment.
The fire extended to the Trinity Alps Wilderness and reached over 21,000 acres before being contained
in mid-November.

The Tubbs Fire in October 2017 was the most destructive wildfire in California history. It spanned Napa,
Sonoma and Lake Counties burning over 36,000 acres and claiming 22 lives. During the month it took to
contain the fire, a team of four Palo Alto Firefighters from Engine 65 worked eleven days straight on a
strike team to assist in the statewide effort.

As part of the October Fire Storm, Engine 66 was deployed to the Mendocino Complex Fire as part of a
multi-county task force as many strike team units were already on scene at the Tubbs fire. This fire
extended to over 36,000 acres and claimed 546 structures. Crews were on duty for nine consecutive
days.

                                                                     650.329.2184
                                                                     650.327.6951 fax

                                                                       Fire Department



The final large fire in the State that we deployed units to was in December to Ventura County for the
Thomas Fire. This fire spread to over 281,000 acres and is the largest wildfire in modern California
history. It also had the largest firefighting force on record in California, totaling over 8,500 firefighters.
Our crews were there for a 14 day deployment. This fire tragically claimed the life of CalFire Firefighter
Cory Iverson, who was from the CalFire San Diego Unit. He died from smoke inhalation and thermal
injuries. We honored his service and sacrifice by lowering the flags to half-mast and attending local
services to mourn the loss of a fellow firefighter.

The courage and commitment to protecting our community and those who need us most is honorable,
brave and demonstrated the best our City has to offer. The women and men of the Palo Alto Fire
Department put their lives on the line at home and abroad. To those members and their families that
stepped up to serve and fight these fires, I give my heartfelt gratitude and acknowledgement. These
dauntless members of our team include: Fire Captain Barry Marchisio; Fire Captain Toby McDonnell; Fire
Captain Marc Muzzi; Apparatus Operator Shelia Donovan; Apparatus Operator Carlos Gracia; Apparatus
Operator Adam Palsgrove; Apparatus Operator Anthony Sozio; Firefighter Steven Fanchiang; Firefighter
Adam Fortino; Firefighter Daniel Fortino; Firefighter Manny Macias; Firefighter Eban Johnson; Firefighter
Nick Penko; Firefighter Chris Pombo; and Firefighter John Preston.

The gratitude received from residents and communities served were overwhelming, and I’ve not seen
this level of gratitude in my 31 years as a professional firefighter. The Department received thank you
notes and letters all of which are attached at the end of this report and decorate the walls of the sixth
floor. Let these serve as a reminder of the reason we got into public service, and the impact we have on
those we serve.

Sincerely,




Eric Nickel, EFO, CFC, CFO

                  First Semi-Annual Performance
                  Report Fiscal Year 2018
Calls for Service
The Palo Alto Fire Department (PAFD) responded to a total of 4,637 calls for service in the first six-
month period of Fiscal Year 2018. This includes responses within Palo Alto, Stanford, and neighboring
cities to provide Auto and Mutual Aid. Approximately seventy-nine percent (79%) of calls are
generated from Palo Alto, fifteen percent (15%) from Stanford, and the remainder from neighboring
cities or requests for regional fire deployment.
The majority of calls were for Rescue and Emergency Medical Services, making up fifty-eight percent
(58%) of the responses. Table 1 below shows the main categories of the calls to which PAFD
responded. Calls are classified based on the actual event occurred, rather than the initial call request.


                               Call Type                     FY17 JUL-DEC FY18 JUL-DEC

Good Intent and False Alarm calls make up the second largest types of responses. Most calls for service
that may be a true threat of fire, gas or other emergency hazard are actually found to be something
else after Firefighters investigate the situation. These calls are coded as Good Intent calls. As well,
many fire alarm activations are from causes other than fire or emergency hazard. These situations are
categorized as False Alarm calls.

Emergency Medical Services and Rescue
Emergency Medical Service (EMS) is the primary service that the Palo Alto Fire Department provides to
Palo Alto and Stanford. While this shift toward EMS is being seen across the region, the Palo Alto Fire
Department is the only Fire Department in the County that provides ambulance and transport services.
Of the 2,692 Emergency Medical Service calls the PAFD responded to in the first period of Fiscal Year
2018, the overwhelming majority were for medical, trauma and cardiac calls that did not involve a
vehicle accident.

        scene to EMS calls
This period reflects a slight dip in the number of Rescue and EMS Incident calls. The number of EMS
calls that resulted in an ambulance transport to a local hospital or care facility, accounted for sixty
three percent (63%) of all EMS calls. This is the primary source of revenue generated from emergency
medical services, and the Department has seen the revenue flatten out over the last period.
The most common rescue calls involve the removal of victims from a stalled elevator totaling twenty-
nine (29) that is ninety-one (91%) of these call types. Lock-Ins revealed a decrease this period
accounting for twenty seven percent (27%) of rescue calls.

     Response Time Goal Met: At least 90% of first responder arriving on scene to EMS calls within
      eight minutes.
This period the PAFD first responder arrived on scene to EMS calls within eight minutes ninety-five
percent (95%) of the time.

     Response Time Goal Met: At least 99% of paramedic responder arriving on scene to EMS calls
      within 12 minutes.
This quarter the PAFD paramedic responder arrived on scene to EMS calls within 12 minutes ninety-
nine percent (99%) of the time.

Fire Suppression
Very few of the potential fire calls coming into dispatch turn out to be a real fire once PAFD
investigates the scene and cause of the concerning elements. This period PAFD responded to 105 calls
where fire was present, with 81 in Palo Alto or Stanford. There were twelve building fires that the
Department responded to in Palo Alto and Stanford, ten of which were contained to the area of origin.
The first fire occurred July 12 at an apartment building on 3800 block of Park Boulevard. The fire was
determined to have started from cooking which then spread to cabinets and wall. Upon arrival, the
first in unit, Engine 64, established Incident Command and secured a hydrant water supply from Engine
65. The fire was quickly extinguished and confined to area of origin. There were no injuries. All
residents were allowed to return to their homes except for those from the involved unit. The
American Red Cross arrived to assist the displaced residents.
Another fire in July began with flames showing from a garage at the 2300 block of Waverly Street.
Engine 62 was the first in unit and established Incident Command, then set up for a fire attack. The
garage was a detached single story unit that was fully involved with fire. The fire was quickly confined
to the garage, with no extension to the main house or neighbors. Utilities to the unit were
disconnected and the structure was “red tagged” by the City Building Department. The cause of the
fire was a hot barbecue with the lid off placed next to the door. The family had just used the grill and
moved it before the unit had cooled sufficiently. Fire investigators estimated the damage at $500,000.
On August 9 another kitchen fire occurred at a four-story mid-rise on 700 block of Escondido. The fire
set off the alarm and activated sprinklers causing flooding on the floor. Engine 66 investigated the unit
on the third floor and found the fire has been extinguished by two activated sprinkler heads. Crews
opened the drain to decrease the water pressure. A burn patient approached crew and requested an
ambulance, and Medic 62 administered patient care to the patient who stated that he was cooking in
his kitchen when something caught fire and he was burned. This incident left water damage on all
floors below the fire floor. Water evacuation procedures were implemented and salvage and overhaul
of the affected units conducted. The building was secured and handed over to Stanford Maintenance
for restoration.
In early September in the 800 block of El Camino Real, Engine 61 responded to a fire alarm for water
flowing. Upon arrival crews saw smoke coming from the rear of the building, out of the eaves and the
vent and upgraded the event to a full first alarm. Crews forced the first floor door and found a light
haze of smoke and some water coming from the hallway, and light smoke throughout the building. The
source was determined to be a vent in the bathroom that contained heavy smoke and some heat
where a sprinkler had been activated. Upon removing the ceiling tiles, crews were able to extinguish
the fire.
Another incident of note occurred in late November in the 3900 block of El Camino Real. Units arrived
on scene to a laundromat with the interior charged with smoke. Engine 65 made entry with a hose line
and found a dryer on fire, and was able to quickly extinguish the fire. Ventilation of the facility was
conducted, and upon investigation it was determined that excessive storage to the rear of the
structure had contributed to the fire.

Hazardous Materials
The Fire Department responded to a total of 77 calls related to hazardous material incidents. The most
common Hazardous Material call is spills and leaks of either natural or liquid petroleum gas (LPG)
which totaled 42. This number accounted for fifty-five (55%) percent of all Hazardous Material calls.
The second highest Hazardous Material calls were related to electrical wiring or equipment problems.
Twenty-six (26) of these calls account for thirty-four (34%) percent of all Hazardous Material calls.

Mutual and Automatic Aid
The Fire Department previously holds automatic aid agreements with five regional Fire Departments,
including Mountain View, Menlo Park, Woodside, Los Altos, and Santa Clara County Fire. Palo Alto
continues to primarily provide mutual and automatic aid to the City of Mountain View, at higher rates
than aid received by Mountain View. The Department has made deployment changes and subsequent
modifications to the mutual and automatic aid agreements with Mountain View. In the final report for
Fiscal Year 2018 it is expected that these numbers will decline for both providing and receiving aid as a
result.

In this period, the PAFD provided mutual or automatic aid to three other jurisdictions which it had not
in the previous year. Of the seven other jurisdictions where mutual aid was provided Santa Clara
County received the next highest aid from the department. Six other agencies provided mutual or
automatic aid for calls within Palo Alto or Stanford on a total of 61 incidents.

Fire Prevention
The Fire Prevention Bureau ensures compliance with the Fire Code for the safety of occupants and
protection of property. Fire Inspectors perform fire sprinkler and fire alarm plan checks, permitting,
and field inspections with the goal of ensuring all construction complies with local and national codes.
This year the Prevention Bureau has been able to track inspections with more detail and we have
modified the methodology for capturing this data point. Rather than tracking single locations, we are
tracking each inspection. It more accurately captures the workload of inspections by capturing the
number of inspections, as most locations require multiple inspections. The figure for Fiscal Year 2017
has been updated to reflect the same methodology.
This period saw a decrease in the number of permits issued compared the same period in the prior
year. The number of Fire Inspections and Hazardous Material inspections increased, and the number of
plans to review slightly decreased.

Workforce Planning
The Department operates daily emergency response operations with a total of 96.00 FTE line
personnel. This includes three battalions of crews that staff six stations in the City and Stanford 24
hours each day. Over the last period, the department has operated with 17.0 positions vacant and 6.0
employees off-line creating a total of 23.00 FTE positions that require backfill.
The vacant positions are primarily within the Firefighter and Apparatus Operator Classifications, with
five vacant Fire Captain positions. During this Fiscal Year the Department will conduct a promotional
process for Fire Captain, which will shift all vacancies to the Apparatus Operator and Firefighter ranks.
In addition, 11.0 FTE of these vacancies were eliminated effective January 2018 due to the deployment
changes resulting from extensive and detailed meet and confer processes with the labor union, and
approval from City Council.
The proportion of shift staff eligible to retire within the next five years continues to grow, currently
making up more than half of all shift staff. The Department is focusing on bolstering succession
planning and hiring efforts in order to prepare for the consistent turn-over expected over the next 5 to
10 years.
Training hours reported for this period continue to reflect a reduction as the division is in transition to
a new tracking and records management software.

Our sincere thanks to the team who visited our home this evening, and carefully checked for the source
of our “burnt marshmallow” smell. After you left, we later discovered that there is a 15‐amp fuse
leading to our furnace (separate from the circuit‐breaker panel), and it had blown. We don’t know why
and will get a serviceman here to find out. Thank you again for your thorough inspection. It gave us
some much needed peace of mind.

Sincerely,

Mike and Lisa Fremont

The message from Ann reads as follows ‐

"This Anne DeBusk, I live on Alvarado road at Stanford and our alarm went off for smoke and fired and
made a huge noise and then Captain William Crump came to the door with Emilio and they stayed and
really tried to work on it and were a great help. The security people couldn’t even fix it! They were very
helpful and I really highly commend them and I wanted to tell you. Thank you very much, they were
really professional and tried their hardest to figure out the system. But none of us could because it was
the fire and smoke part of the system and we just use the system for coming and going for security. I
wanted to get this message to you.”
