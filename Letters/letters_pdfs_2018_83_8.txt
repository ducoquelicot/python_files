                                         Fire Prevention Week
                                          October 7-13, 2018
         WHEREAS, the City of Palo Alto is committed to ensuring the safety and security of all those living in
and visiting the community; and
         WHEREAS, U.S. home fires resulted in 3,390 civilian deaths in 2016, representing the majority (78
percent) of all U.S. fire deaths; and
         WHEREAS, newer homes are built with lightweight materials that burn faster than older home
constructions, and many of today’s products and furnishings produce toxic gases and smoke when burned, making
it impossible to see and breathe within moments; and
         WHEREAS, these conditions contribute to a much smaller window of time for people to escape a home
fire safely, with people having as little as one to two minutes to escape from the time the smoke alarm sounds;
and
         WHEREAS, a home fire escape plan, which should be developed by all members of the household,
includes two exits from every room in the home; a path to the outside from each exit; smoke alarms in all required
locations; and a meeting place outside where everyone in the home will meet upon exiting; and
         WHEREAS, the City of Palo Alto Fire Department first responders are dedicated to reducing the
occurrence of home fires and home fire injuries through prevention and protection education; and
         WHEREAS, the City of Palo Alto residents are encouraged to participate in public education measures
so they are able to take personal steps to increase their safety from fire, especially in their homes; and
         WHEREAS, the 2018 Fire Prevention Week theme, “Look. Listen. Learn. Be aware. Fire can happen
anywhere” effectively serves to educate the public about three basic but essential steps to take to reduce the
likelihood of having a fire and how to escape safely in the event of one.
         NOW, THEREFORE, I, Liz Kniss, Mayor of the City of Palo Alto, on behalf of the City Council, do
hereby proclaim October 7-13, 2018 as Fire Prevention Week throughout this community; and urge all the people
of Palo Alto to develop a home fire escape plan with all members of the household and practice it twice a year,
and to participate in the many public safety activities and efforts of the City of Palo Alto Fire and Emergency
Services during Fire Prevention Week 2018.
