           Sales Tax Highlights – Fourth Quarter Sales (October – December 2017)

        Informational Report to the City Council



BACKGROUND

Sales and use tax represents $31.5 million, or 15 percent, of projected General Fund revenue in the
City’s adopted operating budget for fiscal year 2018. This revenue includes sales and use tax for the City
of Palo Alto and pool allocations from the state and Santa Clara County.1

We contract with MuniServices LLC (MuniServices) for sales and use tax recovery services and
informational reports. We use the recovery services and informational reports to help identify
misallocation of tax revenue owed to the City, and to follow up with the California Department of Tax
and Fee Administration (formerly the State Board of Equalization) to ensure that the City receives
identified revenues. We include sales and use tax recovery information in our quarterly reports to the
Policy and Services Committee.

The California Revenue and Taxation Code, Section 7056, requires that sales and use tax data remain
confidential. Therefore, the City may not disclose amounts of tax paid, fluctuations in tax amounts, or
any other information that would disclose the operations of a business. This report, including the
attached Sales Tax Digest Summary, includes certain modifications and omissions to maintain the
required confidentiality of taxpayer information.

MuniServices prepares the Sales Tax Digest Summary and Economic & News Trends report (Attachments
B and D), which we share with the Administrative Services Department (ASD) for use in revenue
forecasting and budgeting. The Economic Categories and Segments are shown in Attachment C. Sales tax
information is reported on a calendar‐year basis.

DISCUSSION

The Sales Tax Digest Summary covers fourth quarter sales for calendar year 2017, which are reported as
part of the City’s fiscal year 2018 revenue. In May 2018, ASD should receive information from the state
on aggregate sales and use tax receipts for the first quarter of 2018. Following are some highlights of the
sales and use tax information:
           Palo Alto’s overall sales and use tax revenue (cash receipts) for the fourth quarter of 2017
            increased by $430,000, or 5.4 percent, including pool allocations, compared to the fourth
            quarter of 2016. For all Santa Clara County jurisdictions, sales and use tax revenue for the fourth
            quarter of 2017 increased by $7.0 million, or 6.2 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of
            2016.
           Statewide, most regions in California experienced an increase in sales and use tax revenue for
            the year ending in December 2017, with a one‐year statewide increase of 3.6 percent.
           Palo Alto’s sales and use tax revenue totaled $30.0 million for the year ending in December
            2017, an increase of 5.4 percent from $28.4 million during the prior one‐year period.

              Excluding pool allocations and adjusting for prior‐period and late payments, Palo Alto’s sales and
               use tax revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 4.1 percent compared to the fourth
               quarter of 2016. The annual increase was 1.3 percent compared to the prior year.

     Economic Influences on Sales and Use Tax

     The Economic News & Trends report discusses economic influences, including national and state
     economic trends, auto, retail, e‐commerce, restaurant and grocery trends, that may affect the City’s
     sales and use tax revenue.

     Preliminary estimates from the California Employment Development Department show that the
     March 2018 unemployment rate, which is not seasonally adjusted, was 2.6 percent in Santa Clara
     County and 2.2 percent in Palo Alto.

     DEFINITIONS

     In California, either sales tax or use tax may apply to a transaction, but not both. The sales and use tax
     rate in Palo Alto was 9.0 percent during the fourth quarter of 2017.

     Sales tax – imposed on all California retailers; applies to all retail sales of merchandise (tangible personal
     property) in the state.

     Use tax – generally imposed on consumers of merchandise (tangible personal property) that is used,
     consumed, or stored in this state; purchases from out‐of‐state retailers when the retailer is not
     registered to collect California tax or does not collect California tax for some other reason; and leases of
     merchandise (tangible personal property).

     Countywide/statewide pools – mechanisms used to allocate local tax that cannot be identified with a
     specific place of sale or use in California. Local tax reported to the pool is distributed to the local
     jurisdiction each calendar quarter using a formula that relates to the direct allocation of local tax to each
     jurisdiction for a given period.

     Examples of taxpayers who report use tax allocated through the countywide pool include:
         Construction contractors who consume materials used when improving real property and whose
            job site is regarded as the place of business
         California or out‐of‐state sellers who ship goods directly to consumers in the county from
            inventory located outside the state
         Auctioneers, catering trucks, itinerant vendors, and vending machine operators and other
            permit holders who operate in more than one local jurisdiction but are unable to readily identify
            the particular jurisdiction where the taxable transaction takes place
