Dear Supervisors and Council People:

WILPF Low-income housing committee members urge EPA Council to not let Stanford be permitted to
expand the labs/ industrial park or an other office development UNTIL they provide 10,000 units (not
beds) of LOW INCOME HOUSING for its service sector workers, an then students. Increase the $per sq ft to
$250,. Stanford and Palo Alto have gotten away with de-facto segregation, not hardly building any LOW
income housing for its service sector and other workers, and they have not conributed $$ for the Palo Alto
School District. It's time for Stanford to provide its FAIR SHARE of low-income housing so that workers need
not travel long distances, creating more eco-devastation, more time lost from familites. Housing for our low-
paid workers FIRST.

Subject:                       Castilleja Expansion: Still No Plans; Why So Many Variances?; Draft EIR




                                                    JULY 2018


                             Castilleja Expansion:
                 Still No Floor Plans; Variances Galore; DEIR
       It's been two years, where are the plans? For starters, Castilleja is asking for a myriad of
       variances and special exemptions, because they are not submitting a compliant project. To
       name a few:

              Castilleja is asking for an above-grade floor area ratio (FAR) that is 38% above
               code (code = 87,000, asking for 120,000).
               See PA Weekly »
              Castilleja is trying to convince PA Utilities to shift or reduce the size of a utility
               easement by 5 feet. The utility easement cuts across the campus where Melville
               Avenue used to dead-end, and carries all water, sewage, etc. for the neighborhood.
              They seek to reduce setbacks along Embarcadero Road to virtually zero, to make
               room for a planned underground garage.
              Castilleja wants to remove protected mature oaks and redwoods.
              Castilleja claims they are exempt from residential code, even though they operate in
               an R1 zone. Thus they think an underground garage in an R1 neighborhood should
               not count as floor space.

       PNQL is actively engaged with city staff to monitor activities and requests, and to offer our
       input.

       Draft Environmental Report (DEIR)
       City planning staff expects to see the DEIR this year. The public will have 45 days to
       comment. It's hard to believe that a DEIR would not red flag the planned underground
       garage. The entrance is on the Bryant Bike Boulevard, and it empties into the neighborhood
       at Melville and Emerson.

                               Muni Code 18.12.60(e)
                           When is a Garage Not a Garage?
  An underground garage in an R1 neighborhood requires a variance per Muni Code 18.12.60(e), in which case
  it is added to the floor area ratio of the property. Castilleja is proposing an underground garage not attached to
    any above-grade structure. City planning staff says it's not a residence so it does not count toward FAR. So,
                                             why do we have a muni code???


     Castilleja Continues to Make a Mockery of Neighborhood
                             Meetings
  Castileja meetings with neighbors are required biannually, to discuss neighbors' concerns. The last 3 meetings
  have been PR events for the school, and they refuse to answer any detailed questions or have subject matter
  experts in attendance. We get the same dog-and-pony show about the proposed plans and total disregard for
                                                  our concerns.

                           The Playing Field is Not Level
          The PR firm hired by the new owners of the President Hotel has 2 former city planners on staff.
         Among their other clients are Castilleja, Google, and Facebook. We're up against a well-financed
         and well-connected opponent determined to change the face of our neighborhood on behalf of a
              non-profit corporation whose customers (students) are 75% from outside of Palo Alto.

           Castilleja doesn't pay property taxes or income taxes, and puts a lot of wear and tear on the
                              infrastructure, so we as neighbors subsidize the school.

Dear City Council and Planning Commissioners

I am a resident of Downtown North, and have been involved in several local activities related to traffic, safety
and neighborhood quality of life. I urge you to:

1. Take no action on downtown office cap until all residents in the Downtown RPP are fully notified and
informed about parking impact including the unkonwn funding of the programs to manage the RPP. Staffing
and budgets to manage permit parking are on the shakiest grounds in the past two years.

2. Take no action until neighborhood traffic solutions are fully discussed with neighbors currently challenging
safety and traffic issues on Middlefield, Hamilton, Lincoln and Addison.

Thank you,

Neeraj Pendse
(Downtown North resident for 11 years)

Subject:                        Dewatering Regulations and Enforcement



Palo Alto City Council,

My home has been impacted by the dewatering project at 3428 Cowper Ct and I’m disappointed with your
enforcement of the regulations for that activity. Building Permit 16000-03007 was issued on July 6, 2017 and the
City’s May 4, 2017 dewatering rules should have applied.

On this project, not even the 2016 version of the rules were applied. According to written communication from
the City’s Chief Engineer the project did not expect groundwater and significant pumping was not expected
and thus the rules need not apply.

Many neighbors know the groundwater is high and water must be pumped when basements are built. It
happened right next door in 2012. The City has a map with groundwater levels so the City and the builder
cannot plead ignorance. When groundwater is encountered, digging is supposed to stop and a written
dewatering plan must be developed and then followed. Exceptions should not be made for poor planning.

When they dug the wells and turned on the pumps, the water came gushing and did not stop. The following
elements from their 2016 dewatering worksheet you have on file have not been followed, despite the fact that
the City has assured us on multiple occasions that they are.

       Plans called for 6-8 wells operating at 25-35 gpm each. They operated 4 wells for 3 weeks and 2 wells
          since June 25. I routinely see pump rates of 40 to 50 gpm from a single well. Less wells do not mean
          less impact, one of the two wells that continues to operate is about 125ft from my property, that well
          operating at that rate was not in the engineer’s specifications.
       No radius of influence, or calculated cone of depression was available for me to review of the site. My
          house is within the zone, and has clearly been impacted. I am not reassured by an engineer from the
          same town as the contractor checks a box saying he does not anticipate any impacts.
       Construction plans called for the discharge hose to be buried under the street to lessen the impact to
          neighbors. It has been snaking along more than a quarter mile of the street, impacting several highly
          used parking areas for more than 2 months.
       A couple of large trees less than 20 ft from the excavated zone are clearly sick. No arborist has
          intervened and zero water has been diverted to save them.
       A fill station was not built, no use plan for the water was submitted, and 100% of the water from this
          project went down the drain. At this point approximately 10 million gallons of water have been
          pumped down the local storm drain.

That water is coming from under my house and I’ve filled more cracks than ever this year in every room of my
house. The crack in my living room floor has doubled in size to ¼ inch and is becoming a trip hazard for the
disabled resident in the house. An engineer I hired has assured us the house is safe, an expense I took on to
ease my family's nerves about the noises coming from all corners of the house. Concrete walkways around
my house are less even and more cracked than ever.

In the three weeks since I became alarmed with the damage to my house, I’ve collected five reports of damage
people have suffered from nearby dewatering, hosted twelve people in my home for 2 hours to discuss the
topic, and visited City Hall for the first time in my life. I’d appreciate something other than another false
                                                        1

reassurance that everything is OK because it clearly is not. Maybe a written apology for your handling of this
situation, some stricter rules put in place and actually enforced next time around?

The City absolutely must adopt regulations which limit the total pumping rate to a value that will not impact
nearby properties. It is simply neither fair nor practical for those impacted by dewatering to be forced to
mitigate the impacts. The city should limit the pumping rate to 30 gallons per minute without exception. This
would be easy to enforce, reduce the impact, and is realistic to achieve with current technology. Such a
limitation does not prevent property owners from building basements – it simply forces them to consider and
partially mitigate the negative impacts of their construction.

Many of the new homes that have been built recently were constructed purely for profit. The FOR SALE signs
were up while the construction trucks were still in the driveway. I don’t know if that will be the case for this
home, but the waivers granted to 3428 Cowper Court decreased the project costs to the developer/owner
considerably by avoiding the need to truck water. These benefits flow directly to the contractor and owner,
while significant costs are incurred by nearby property owners. This does generate permit fees and increases
tax revenue for the City of Palo Alto, but it hurts the actual residents of Palo Alto.

I urge you not to remove the 350,000 sq foot commercial cap. At a time
when housing, traffic, and parking are in perennial crisis, it seems
politically foolish to remove a provision that, even if not currently
invoked, can provide some limitation on the forces that would create ever
more jobs in Palo Alto. What exactly are we afraid of if we seek to
manage employment levels? We need a coordinated policy, with specifics
- which I do not think the General Plan actually provides - to balance
housing and jobs. As has been said, "If we want things to stay as they are,
things will have to change."

Subject: City Fiscal Conditions report from NLC

Attached is the most recent “City Fiscal Conditions” report by the National League of Cities (NLC). Generally, it shows
that public sector employers are struggling with the pension and retiree health plans related problems across the
Country. The cost of pensions increased in more than 70% of cities, and one in three cities identified these expenses as
the largest expense affecting their budget.

The survey supporting data show that between 2009 and 2016, 33% of public sector employers increased employee
contribution rates; 22% changed plan design; 17% reduced benefits; 12% reduced the cost of living adjustment; 8%
increased eligibility requirements and 7% increased the vesting period. Hybrid plans – a combination of a defined benefit
and defined contribution plan – gained additional popularity, as well as anti‐spiking provisions designed to increase the
number of years used in the plan’s calculation to figure out an employee’s final compensation, lessening the impact of a
single year’s substantial pay raise. A number of the cities used Section 115 Retirement Trust as a way to put money aside
right now to help offset additional costs in the future. The survey also found that the cost of employee/retiree pensions
is the third largest cost for most cities following infrastructure and public safety needs and 81% of those surveyed said
that pension costs increased in the last year.

Hope you find the information helpful. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

In the wake of a slow recovery, the fiscal condition of U.S. cities
is strengthening. The nation’s city finance officers widely report
improved fiscal health, driven by better-than-anticipated General
Fund revenue growth and solid performance of ending balances.
Each year, the National League of Cities surveys city finance
officers about actual and budgeted revenues and expenditures
as well as policy actions and priorities. Taken together, their
responses provide a snapshot of the “average city” within the
municipal sector.

What is the City Fiscal Conditions Survey?
The City Fiscal Conditions Survey is a national survey of finance officers in U.S. cities conducted in the
spring-summer of each year. This is the 31st annual edition of the NLC survey, which began in 1986.

Beyond 2016
In 2016, stronger city revenues are building the capacity of cities to deliver critical
services and improve quality of life. This trajectory of growth, however, is threatened
by number of persistent concerns:

      The recovery dynamics of the real estate market, namely low inventory paired
      with rising prices, are depleting stocks of affordable housing throughout
      the country. This will lead not only to uncertainty regarding property tax
      collections, but as workers move further from job centers to find more
      affordable housing, entire regional economies will be threatened;

      The prolonged effects of slow and inequitable growth of employment and
      wages will weigh heavily on future city income tax revenues and sales tax
      receipts; and

      As cities move to shore up healthcare and pension liabilities, the additional
      expenditures required in their General Funds will compete for scarce resources
      with other city services, confronting city leaders with difficult choices among
      employee and retiree benefits, city service levels, and raising new revenues.

These concerns are foremost on the minds of city leaders, some of whom are
implementing pension reforms and leveraging fiscal planning tools. These strategies
are particularly important given that city revenues have not fully recovered from
the Great Recession. As a result, many may be operating with suppressed revenues
when and if another recession emerges in the coming years. For now, though, city
fiscal conditions are showing signs of vitality, with local governments reinvesting in
areas critical to growth and community quality of life including infrastructure and
public safety.

the low point for city revenues and
expenditures after the 1991 recession
occurred in 1993, approximately two years
after the trough of the U.S. economic
recession (March 1991 to March 1993).
After the 2001 recession, the low point for
city revenues and expenditures occurred
in 2003, approximately 18 months
after the trough of the U.S. economic
recession (November 2001-April 2003).
Our reporting on this lag is dependent
upon when the annual NLC survey
is conducted, meaning that there is
some degree of error in the length of
the lag – for instance, had the survey
been conducted in November of 1992,
rather than April of 1993, we might have
seen the effects of changing economic
conditions earlier. Nevertheless, the
evidence suggests that the effects of
changing economic conditions tend to
take 18-24 months to be reflected in city
budgets.

When we report on non-fiscal data
(such as finance officers’ assessment of
their ability to meet fiscal needs, fiscal
actions taken, or factors affecting their
budgets), we are referring to percentages
of responses to a particular question on
a one-response-per-city basis. Thus, the
contribution of each city’s response to
these questions is weighted equally.

PS- Remember when 4 council members had to recuse selves
from a vote due to commercial property interests downtown?
The perpetual machine majority (council/developers) aided and

Take no action without clear, quantified study of impact on neighborhoods

         Mr. Doug Vagim

       Doug- You'll love this:

78450701&mc_cid=fa7075d367&mc_eid=7afa3a94f3

   Note that they're all wringing their hands about the Calif. Sustainable Groundwater Management Act,
SGMA, I guess.

     Now that the State has knocked out the dangerous Temperance Flat Reservoir project- a total
boondoggle that would have placed 1.8 MAF of water upstream from Fresno behind it and Friant Dam- they
should all consider the Stanford report on Managed Aquifer Recharge- MAR.

       I sent numerous emails about this report to all a year ago. It would be a state regulated project- farmers
et. al. would decide where to put the facilities. Officials would not just show up with the sheriff and tell a
farmer that "we are going to flood 100 acres of your land for 10 years". These would be purpose built facilities
that would flood areas of land, impound water on there, and let it perc into the aquifer.

      Here is an article discussing the MAR plan:

      https://news.stanford.edu/2016/07/21/cost-effective-path-drought-resiliency/

       Existing canals in the CV and some new ones would convey water from the San Joaquin and other rivers
out to these impound facilities. The farmers and other owners of the land would be compensated for the loss of
production on the affected land BUT where many of them now fallow land due to lack of water, a recovering
aquifer would instead allow groundwater pumping in abundance. I see two huge benefits of this idea:

       1) We would not be impounding 1.8 MAF of water upstream from Fresno, which is on schedule to go
from 520,000 people to 1.5 million people by 2100, if the local politicians and developers get their way. I
predict that they will be sued and then prosecuted out of that idea at some point, but putting even the current
Valley population at risk is just unacceptable.

         With the crazy Temperance Flat Dam proposal, we would have had a total of 1.8 MAF of water
impounded just upstream from 520,000 Fresnans, with some greater population number sure to come. Around
2100, we'll get a repeat of the Cascadia Subduction Zone quake, magnitude 9.0, which occurred in the year
1700. Geologists think it has a 400 year recurrence interval. The entire Pacific Northwest will be devastated by
this, and the shaking in Fresno will be as severe as was that in downtown San Francisco on April 18, 1906. If

                                                       2

either Friant or Temperance Flat Dam, or both, failed in that, it would kill many thousands of people. That
alone justified killing T.F. Dam.

        How prosecuted? As the severe impacts of sea level rise and climate change become more costly in
money and lives, legislation will be passed to rein in out of control developers and politicians. The people we
elect are not going to just look at the bible and say "Be fruitful and multiply" (and further enrich the
developers, generous as they are with us). They are going to start looking at reports on climate change coming
out of Stanford and other centers of science. They already are. This plan to add one million people inside the
city limits of Fresno is a pipe-dream. It will not happen. See "The Earth Under Water" by the BBC on
YouTube to see why not.

       Here it is:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqdLD31FkW4


       A not so tiny sidenote: As climate change due to human-caused GHG production proceeds, sea levels
will continue to rise. At some point, if we do not act to prevent it, we will lose the Delta as a source of fresh
water. Maybe a six foot rise in sea levels will salt up the entire Delta. You see that in "The Earth Under
Water". That is the water supply for the Delta-Mendota and California Aqueducts. The former supplies water
for farmers on the west side and the latter supplies it for 25 million people in So. California. The solution to
that scenario is to build the Golden Gate Dam, and we should get started on it right away. You see that in "The
Earth Under Water" too.


        2) A year ago we let billions of gallons of Sierra run-off flow down the San Joaquin and other rivers to
the sea. No means to store it was in place as Friant Dam et. al. were overtopping. With the Stanford MAR plan
implemented, much of that water could have been channeled out into the CV and allowed to perc into our
aquifer. It would be there as you read this. I believe that this is the real answer to the SGMA requirements.
Don't just try to live from surface water, which will vary in volume with recurring droughts. In wet years,
channel the excess water out into the valley to the MAR facilities and recharge the aquifer. That is our piggy
bank. Doing that will smooth out the fluctuations in surface water. No more watching billions of gallons of
pure Sierra runoff going to the sea in wet years, and no dangerous dam just upriver from a big population
center to capture the water. The MAR plan would be a huge, safe answer to our depleted aquifer.

   Mr. Feinstein- I have not even read this yet but thought that you should see it.

    https://news.stanford.edu/2018/07/19/liquid-metal-high-voltage-flow-battery-2/

   I hope your lithium metal battery (which is NOT this Stanford battery) is progressing. You saw that, about
a month ago, a Tesla Model S in the LA area parked at the curb with no one in it caught fire. Flames were
shooting up the right side of the car along the front door.

    One might think that Mr. Musk, and GM, would be camping outside your door to accelerate work on your
safer battery.

     See Nova "Search for the Super Battery" to see what Ionic Materials has, about midway through the
Nova program. It is stunning.

      Mr. Doug Vagim-

     Doug- I know you've seen this since you read Hostetter's stuff. Powell, who I don't think much of, shot
himself in the foot when he declared who would benefit if this passes: Kids and families.

       What if you're a single, white male without kids, paying his bills, obeying the law, contributing to this
community? How comfortable would you feel attending a park in Fresno with mostly non-white families with
lots of kids? Not comfortable at all, BUT YOU GET TO PAY FOR THIS under these sales tax proposals. I
object to it.

        One tiny additional point: FPOA President Kurz let out a bunch of gas in favor of Brand's proposed
sales tax since some of the money would go to the police.

      A smart man like Kurz would have at least one degree, maybe more. He's taken plenty of courses in
Economics, as have I, with three degrees. He knows that a sales tax is a regressive tax. It falls most heavily on
those least able to pay.

       We could get this money by charging admission to the parks. That way, the users of the parks would pay
for the parks. Re Brand's sales tax, we could bill people who make calls for service by the police. Some people
make lots of those, some almost none. Or, we could get money from the state from the progressive income tax
in California. "We have to raise the state income tax rate ever so slightly on incomes over $300,000 per year, on
people like Brand, to upgrade all of the local parks in California, a desperate need". So make the income tax a
little more progressive and lay off the lower income groups with your stinking sales tax ideas.

       I'm not sure whether Brand or Kurz or Powell have an M.S. in Taxation, as I have, or how many
Economics courses they've taken, but a hike in our already high sales tax here is just a way to skin those least
able to pay and to fight back and a way to enrich those so rich that they just laugh at a sales tax, people like
Brand.

      I think Fresno's sales tax is already outrageously high. I get my dental services, most of my entertainment,
books, clothes, meals out, most of it, in Palo Alto and San Mateo, just to avoid enriching the City of Fresno with
its sky-high sales tax. We pay plenty of sales tax now and that should be the upper limit on it. Brand, Kurz and
Powell know nothing about the regressivity of a sales tax, we should believe from their statements. I know that
they know all about it, they just somehow forget to mention it in their proposals for yet another sales tax hike.
The wealthy, Republican owners of Chs. 24, 26, 30 and 47 in Fresno know all about it too.

     "This time around let's not put any big school bonds on the ballot, to be paid for by all homeowners through
yet another hike in their residential property tax. Let's hit them this time with yet another sales tax hike, to
benefit the heavy users of the parks". That's not me, on either count, and I oppose any further hike in our
already gouging sales tax in Fresno.

     A little point about parks. Logan Park is about 400 feet from my home, to the SE. Along its north side runs
Wrenwood Ave. I've taken walks along there at night, less often now with all the shootings in Fresno. Two
neighbors who own homes along the north side of Wrenwood, across from the park, have told me this: People
                                                         2
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/23/2018 9:17 AM
park along there at night and throw all sorts of interesting things from their cars during their visit. One of these
residents has a family and a big German Shepard dog and at least one Doberman for these visitors to see. I'd be
surprised if he does not own a firearm. Another resident told me that loud music from the park is a constant, and
he complained too about trash in and around the park.

      What is really interesting is this: About two years ago, some people, who probably do not live within 10
miles of Logan Park, held a soccer match there one weekend. One thing led to another and this happened:
About a quarter of a mile east of the park on Barstow, a man, one of the players, I believe, was sitting in his car.
Someone drove by this car, apparently, and shot into it, killing him. Out on my walk that night, I saw the police
tape and the police cars. This made the local news. The homeowner who lived directly across Barstow from the
killing has now sold him home and moved away.

     So parks can be a mixed blessing.

     Fresno cops just cannot notice people driving motorcycles, trucks and cars with almost no mufflers. They
will not respond to dogs barking from 2 AM to 5 AM every night. They used to respond to that, until ~2008.
The city is over-run with cockroaches and the City cannot respond to it. The streets and highways are not
worthy of a third-world country. Where is all the money going in Fresno that used to maintain the streets? Some
improvement in the streets is evident. I think we pay more than enough now in Fresno for uneven service.

    Prop 13 put a halt to the extreme property tax gouging by local government in California, and it made local
electeds mad as hell. Endless sales tax hikes are a regressive end-run around Prop 13. If this sales tax crap
makes it onto the ballot, the decent, non-violent people of Fresno who maintain their homes, obey the law,
control their dogs, have mufflers on their cars, pay their bills and are already taxed to death, should vote it
down.

    And then vote out the tax-gougers when they run for office. Ask Pres. George H.W. Bush how that
works.

Subject:                          I totally oppose RAISING the office cap when there's a ballot initiative to lower it




Hello,

An alert council and commission watcher spotted your latest attempt to raise the office cap when public sentiment
seems to favor lowering it so I'm writing to let you know my thoughts.

I am totally opposed to raising the office cap at a time when were already over‐run with commuters and have one of the
highest jobs/housing imbalance in the state. The transportation, gridlock and parking problems are much worse than
when previous "plans" were adopted and citizens finally started paying attention to the degradation of our quality of
life.

I am even more opposed to your actions since they appear to be an end‐run around the grassroots ballot initiative to
CURB office growth that will come before the
voters in November. If I'm wrong about that, please clarify.

More upsetting is the waste of city resources on this new tactic when you have a ballot initiative on the table. Did your
silly push poll suggest that you'd lose in November and hence this new move?

It's upsetting at how much time we residents/ taxpayers have to spend trying to ensure that OUR appointed officials
aren't subverting the will of the voters.

I hope you take resident sentiment to heart for a change. We're paying attention. And we vote.

Most sincerely,

Hon. Mayor Kniss and Hon. Palo Alto Councilmembers,

For the last several months members of the Castilleja community have been sending emails to the
Palo Alto City Council to express support for Castilleja’s proposed CUP and Master Plan, which will
allow the school to fully achieve its mission of educating the next generation of women leaders.

At the beginning of our communication with the City, we were
provided city.clerk@cityofpaloalto.org as the primary address to which we should send email. We
have also been copying the following addresses:
greg.scharff@cityofpaloalto.org
liz.kniss@cityofpaloalto.org
tom.dubois@cityofpaloalto.org
eric.filseth@cityofpaloalto.org
adrian.fine@cityofpaloalto.org
karen.holman@cityofpaloalto.org
lydia.kou@cityofpaloalto.org
greg.tanaka@cityofpaloalto.org
cory.wolbach@cityofpaloalto.org

Unfortunately, we were recently informed many of our supporters' emails were not reaching Council members via their packets.
We have updated your contact information, and new emails will now go to city.council@cityofpaloalto.org. In the interim, the
attached document contains all emails that were sent to the incorrect address and we request this document be included in the
next City Council packet.

Best Regards,

    Dear Mayor Kniss and Members of the Palo Alto City Council,

    My name is Ayesha Bajwa and I live in Palo Alto, CA. I am writing to you as a 2014 graduate and supporter of Castilleja
    School.

    Castilleja was founded 110 years ago to equalize educational opportunities for women. Today, Castilleja seeks to close
    the female leadership gap by gradually adding students over four years. Making this opportunity available for more young
    women is central to furthering that mission.

    As a Palo Alto resident, I am proud to have Castilleja in our city. The school has been an indispensable community
    partner and is committed to maintaining its neighbors’ current quality of life. Castilleja has already implemented robust
    Traffic Demand Management initiatives, and has repeatedly pledged to neighbors not only to do more, but that the
    admittance of new students will be dependent on the continued success of the school’s traffic programs.

    Now more than ever, at a time when national politics has devolved into shouting matches and one-upmanship, Castilleja’s
    mission of serving girls and young women from Palo Alto and other nearby cities is critically important.

    Please do not let the loudest voices in the conversation obscure the robust support for Castilleja found throughout our
    wonderful city.

    Sincerely,

    Ayesha Bajwa

    Dear Mayor Kniss and Members of the Palo Alto City Council,

    My name is Patricia Mcguigan and I live in Palo Alto, Calif. I am writing to you as a Neighbor to the school and supporter
    of Castilleja School.

    Castilleja was founded 110 years ago to equalize educational opportunities for women. Today, Castilleja seeks to close
    the female leadership gap by gradually adding students over four years. Making this opportunity available for more young
    women is central to furthering that mission.

    As a Palo Alto resident, I am proud to have Castilleja in our city. The school has been an indispensable community
    partner and is committed to maintaining its neighbors’ current quality of life. Castilleja has already implemented robust
    Traffic Demand Management initiatives, and has repeatedly pledged to neighbors not only to do more, but that the
    admittance of new students will be dependent on the continued success of the school’s traffic programs.

    Now more than ever, at a time when national politics has devolved into shouting matches and one-upmanship, Castilleja’s
    mission of serving girls and young women from Palo Alto and other nearby cities is critically important.

    Please do not let the loudest voices in the conversation obscure the robust support for Castilleja found throughout our
    wonderful city.

    Sincerely,

    Patricia Mcguigan

    mission of serving girls and young women from Palo Alto and other nearby cities is critically important.

    Please do not let the loudest voices in the conversation obscure the robust support for Castilleja found throughout our
    wonderful city.

    Dear Mayor Scharff and Members of the Palo Alto City Council,

    My name is Victoria Dean and I live in Palo Alto, California. I am writing to you as a member of the Castilleja class of 2013
    and supporter of Castilleja School.

    Castilleja was founded 110 years ago to equalize educational opportunities for women. Today, Castilleja seeks to close
    the female leadership gap by gradually adding students over four years. Making this opportunity available for more young
    women is central to furthering that mission.

    As a Palo Alto resident, I am proud to have Castilleja in our city. The school has been an indispensable community
    partner and is committed to maintaining its neighbors’ current quality of life. Castilleja has already implemented robust
    Traffic Demand Management initiatives, and has repeatedly pledged to neighbors not only to do more, but that the
    admittance of new students will be dependent on the continued success of the school’s traffic programs.

    Now more than ever, at a time when national politics has devolved into shouting matches and one-upmanship, Castilleja’s
    mission of serving girls and young women from Palo Alto and other nearby cities is critically important.


    Please do not let the loudest voices in the conversation obscure the robust support for Castilleja found throughout our
    wonderful city.

    My name is Marilu Serrano and I live in East Palo Alto, California. I am writing to you as a supporter of talented, young
    Latina girls in East Palo Alto and who I hope have a future at Castillega, and in the recent revelations of powerful man
    abusing their power; and supporter of Castilleja School.

    Castilleja was founded 110 years ago to equalize educational opportunities for women. Today, Castilleja seeks to close
    the female leadership gap by gradually adding students over four years. Making this opportunity available for more young
    women is central to furthering that mission.

    As a Palo Alto resident, I am proud to have Castilleja in our city. The school has been an indispensable community
    partner and is committed to maintaining its neighbors’ current quality of life. Castilleja has already implemented robust
    Traffic Demand Management initiatives, and has repeatedly pledged to neighbors not only to do more, but that the
    admittance of new students will be dependent on the continued success of the school’s traffic programs.

    Now more than ever, at a time when national politics has devolved into shouting matches and one-upmanship, Castilleja’s
    mission of serving girls and young women from Palo Alto and other nearby cities is critically important.
    Please do not let the loudest voices in the conversation obscure the robust support for Castilleja found throughout our
    wonderful city.

    Sincerely,

    Marilu Serrano

    Hello,



    I graduated from Castilleja in 2013, having been there for both middle and high school. I am truly so grateful for my time
    at Castilleja and the way it shaped me into who I am today – more ways than I can discuss in a short email. I live in Palo
    Alto, and have my entire life. Castilleja allowed me to discover my passions for helping others, mold my world view, and
    create friendships that I am sure will last a lifetime.



    It is clear to me that Castilleja has put tremendous effort into ensuring the least amount of inconvenience for neighbors as
    possible. I understand that this change might cause tension with the neighbors, but I am confident that changing the lives
    of women, many of whom would not be offered these experiences without Castilleja’s scholarship programs, should be of
    the utmost importance when making the decision. Empowering women leaders will ultimately positively impact both our
    community and the entire world, and I trust that Palo Alto City Council will recognize this and allow for the school’s
    expansion.



    Best Regards,
    Maddy Baum

    Dear Mayor Kniss and Members of the Palo Alto City Council,

    My name is john hanna hanna and I live in palo alto, CA, 94301. I am writing to you as a past trustee, father of two
    graduates, grandfather of a current student and supporter of Castilleja School.

    Castilleja was founded 110 years ago to equalize educational opportunities for women. Today, Castilleja seeks to close
    the female leadership gap by gradually adding students over four years. Making this opportunity available for more young
    women is central to furthering that mission.

    As a Palo Alto resident, I am proud to have Castilleja in our city. The school has been an indispensable community
    partner and is committed to maintaining its neighbors’ current quality of life. Castilleja has already implemented robust
    Traffic Demand Management initiatives, and has repeatedly pledged to neighbors not only to do more, but that the
    admittance of new students will be dependent on the continued success of the school’s traffic programs.

    Now more than ever, at a time when national politics has devolved into shouting matches and one-upmanship, Castilleja’s
    mission of serving girls and young women from Palo Alto and other nearby cities is critically important.

    Please do not let the loudest voices in the conversation obscure the robust support for Castilleja found throughout our
    wonderful city.

    Sincerely,

    john hanna hanna

   On December 30, 1998, the Court of Appeal in California found
that a trial court should have allowed a homeless man cited for
violating the City of Santa Ana’s anti-camping ordinance to assert the
                   1
necessity defense. In an earlier decision, the California Supreme

Court found the anti-camping ordinance constitutional.             The
supreme court left open, however, the possibility for homeless
                                                3
defendants to assert the “necessity defense,” as a justification for
                  4
violating the law. This defense provides a potentially valid reason for
                                     5
breaking the law—out of necessity. In response to the creation of
this option, a number of legal scholars analyzed the application of
                       6
the necessity defense. Their analyses included the consideration of
many factors, including an individual defendant’s efforts to eliminate
his or her homeless condition, and lack of available resources
                         7
provided by the locality. In re Eichorn is the first case to apply the
necessity defense to the violation of an anti-camping ordinance by a
                   8
homeless person, and provides advocates and scholars with their first
glimpse into the role that this defense may play in homeless advocacy.

    2. See Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 892 P.2d 1145, 1161-69 (Cal. 1995) (finding the
ordinance facially constitutional as it does not violate the right to travel or punish
status, and is not vague or overbroad).

process-based necessity defense”).
    4. See 1 WAYNE R. LAFAVE & AUSTIN W. SCOTT, JR., SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW
§ 5.4(a) (1986) [hereinafter SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW] (explaining that “one who,
under the pressure of circumstances, commits what would otherwise be a crime may
be justified by ‘necessity’ in doing as he did and so not be guilty of the crime in
question”).
    5. See Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 539 (explaining that the necessity defense
requires that the defendant be faced with a threatening situation such that no other
legal courses of action exist).

Criminalization as Public Policy, 12 YALE L. & POL’Y REV. 487, 508 (1994) (advocating
for the application of the defense of duress to anti-homeless ordinances over the
defense of necessity).
    7. See McConkey, supra note 6, at 658 (suggesting that a defendant asserting the
defense of necessity needs to prove that he or she had nowhere else to sleep and that
the defendant may not rely solely on evidence that the number of available shelter
beds is insufficient compared to the homeless population).
    8. See Burns, supra note 6, at 808-09 & n.139 (mentioning that Professor Alan
Levine, Hofstra University School of Law, sought to assert the defense of necessity
where police arrested a homeless man for trespassing in an abandoned apartment
building, but the prosecution withdrew the charges); see also Pottinger v. City of
Miami, 810 F. Supp. 1551, 1554 (S.D. Fla. 1992) (noting that members of the class of
plaintiffs could not raise the defenses of necessity or duress to contest an ordinance
that criminalized sleeping and eating in public places because authorities released
the arrested plaintiffs from custody without being charged).

inutility of anti-camping and sleeping ordinances in removing
homeless people from public areas and in serving the broader social
goal of eliminating homelessness altogether. The recent application
of the necessity defense constitutes a shift toward focusing on
                                                                   9

                                          10
away from the theory of voluntarism.         Courts thereby place the
burden on local governments to address the lack of resources
                                11
available to homeless people. This Note discusses potential policy
implications resulting from the application of the necessity defense,
including the potential for a large number of lawsuits. Both the far-
reaching policy implications and the numerous possible lawsuits
prove that in the interest of judicial efficiency, such ordinances
should be abolished.
  Part I of this Note provides national statistics on homeless people,
and discusses causes of homelessness and the lack of affordable
housing and other services. In addition, this section focuses on
specific barriers to services and housing in cities implementing anti-
camping ordinances and how a homeless plaintiff may use these
barriers in asserting a necessity defense. Part II presents an overview
of the case law on anti-camping and sleeping ordinances. Part III
discusses the development of the necessity defense and its use today.
Part IV presents In re Eichorn and discusses the court’s analysis of the
application of the necessity defense where police cited a homeless
man for violating an anti-camping and sleeping ordinance.

     9. Balancing of harms, or comparing harms, is exemplified by the Model Penal
Code § 3.02(1)(a), which states that “the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such
conduct is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense
charged.” Model Penal Code § 3.02(1)(a) (1962); see also John T. Parry, The Virtue of
Necessity: Reshaping Culpability and the Rule of Law, 36 HOUS. L. REV. 397, 417-19
(1999) (discussing the balance-of-harms approach in the context of justification).
    10. “The theory of voluntarism holds that defendants are morally culpable and
may be punished if they had the capacity and opportunity to conform to the law—
that is, at a minimum, if they could have acted differently had they chosen to do so.”
Parry, supra note 9, at 421.
    11. See Debra Livingston, Police Discretion and the Quality of Life in Public Places:
Courts, Communities, and the New Policing, 97 COLUM. L. REV. 551, 560-61 (1997)
(arguing that “police cannot perform substantial order maintenance tasks without
legal authority” and in order to address the inappropriate emphasis on improved
“quality of life” through police enforcement, “there is a need for renewed focus upon
those political, administrative, and other ‘subconstitutional’ controls that might assist
in constraining arbitrary police enforcement”).

as:

the street, many jurisdictions have enacted laws that ban activities
primarily attributed to homeless people, such as sleeping and
                   14
camping in public. Such laws affect a small portion of the 700,000
                                                 15
people who are homeless on any given night.          For instance,
conservative estimates indicate that in Washington, D.C., there are
                       16
7,500 homeless people, but only between 700 and 1,800 live on the

     residence; and
     (2) an individual who has a primary nighttime residence that is—
     (A) a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
     temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate
     shelters, and transitional housing for the mentally ill);
     (B) an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals
     intended to be institutionalized; or
     (C) a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a
     regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.
42 U.S.C. § 11302 (1994). The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act is the
only major federal legislation addressing homelessness. See id. § 11301 (designating
that the purpose of the Act is to address, on a federal level, the “immediate and
unprecedented crises” of homelessness in our nation).
   In addition to the McKinney Act definition of a homeless person, localities such as
Washington, D.C., also consider a family or individual who has lived for any period of
time with another person who is the owner or controller of the residence to be
homeless. Such a condition is called “doubling up.” See MARTHA BURT, OVER THE
EDGE 8 (1992) (noting that doubling up may occur when households want to share
costs when housing becomes unaffordable); see also Maria Foscarinis, Downward
Spiral: Homelessness and its Criminalization, 14 YALE L. & POL’Y REV. 1, 7 (1996) (“Many
homeless individuals and families double up with relatives or friends before reaching
the streets or shelters . . . .”).

comfort, and security in urban public spaces”); see also Elisabeth Bumiller, In Wake of
Attack, Guiliani Cracks Down on Homeless, N.Y. TIMES, Nov. 20, 1999, at A1 (reporting
on Mayor Rudolph Guiliani’s decision that police will arrest homeless people if
found on the street after a homeless man attacked a woman).

whether public or private, without the permission of the owner or person entitled to
the possession or in control of it”).

the U.S. Bureau of Census’ S-Night count of homeless people, which totaled 228,372
people, and concluding that it is more likely that there are between 734,000 and
1,300,000 homeless people in the United States on a given night); see also Martha R.

street.
   National and local statistics on homelessness and resources
available to homeless people provide a background to the impact
anti-sleeping and camping ordinances have on homeless people. The
lack of shelter, affordable housing, and income resources in U.S.
cities indicate that homeless people often have no place to go and
have little opportunity to find housing in the near future. For
homeless persons sleeping on the street, the lack of opportunity to
find and maintain housing inevitably translates into continued
violations of city anti-camping and sleeping ordinances.
   Violations of these ordinances affect a wide cross section of
individuals because the national homeless population is diverse. In
1999, the U.S. Conference of Mayors published A Status Report on
Hunger and Homelessness in America’s Cities: 2000, that analyzed surveys
                                                          18
on hunger and homelessness in twenty-five U.S. cities. Of the cities
surveyed, the report found that 36% of the homeless population were
                          19
families with children; 22% were mentally ill; 37% were substance
                                                        20
abusers; 26% were employed; and 15% were veterans.
   The causes of homelessness are equally diverse. Martha Burt, in
her book Over the Edge, argues that the two direct causes of
                                        21
homelessness are housing and income. The housing factor includes
two variables—rental vacancy rate and the ratio of low-income renters

12, 2001 at A1 (reporting that a recent study from the Metropolitan Washington
Council of Governments found that 7,058 homeless people live in Washington, D.C.
and 5,792 homeless people live in the surrounding suburbs in Maryland and
Virginia).
   17. See id. at 7 (discussing a National Institute for Drug Abuse study conducted in
1992, which found 1,800 homeless people living on the streets and the Community
Partnership’s study, which found 700 people who remain on the streets for a period
of at least 90 days, which the organization considers only an “informed estimate”).

HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICA’S CITIES i (2000) [hereinafter U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS]

major cities where the mayors were members of the Task Force on Hunger &
Homelessness).

most directly affected by housing and income variables); see also U.S. CONFERENCE OF
MAYORS, supra note 18, at ii, 67 (finding that survey cities report that the lack of
affordable housing is the most significant factor that causes homelessness). The U.S.
Conference of Mayors notes that other causes of homelessness include “low paying
jobs;” “substance abuse and the lack of needed services;” “mental illness and the lack
of needed services;” “domestic violence;” “poverty;” “changes in cuts in public
assistance programs;” and “the lack of access to affordable healthcare.” Id. at 67.

Burt also presents indirect factors, such as benefits affecting
homelessness via income, the number of persons in a household who
                                                                   24
can work, the locality’s unemployment rate, and the cost of living.

                             A. Housing, Income, and Shelter Statistics
   The shortage of affordable housing is a significant barrier to
                                           25
housing for a homeless person or family.      In March 1999, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that,
although there is “record growth in the economy,” rental housing is
                                     26
too expensive for low-income persons and there is a “dramatic loss”
                       27
of affordable housing. Those persons who do not receive housing

   22. See BURT, supra note 12, at 162 (noting that a low vacancy rate results in more
homelessness as does a high ratio of low-income renters).
   23. See id. at 162, 164. The Census Bureau determines the poverty rate based
upon “a set of money income thresholds that range by family size and composition to
detect who is poor.” See U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey (CPS)—
Definitions and Explanations (visited Sept. 14, 2000), at http://www.census.gov/

affect homelessness directly. See id. at 164.

AMERICA’S RENTAL HOUSING CRISIS 14 (1999) [hereinafter WAITING IN VAIN]
(determining that, based on the Consumer Price Index for Residential Rent, rents
rose at a rate almost double that of inflation between 1996 and 1998). HUD also
finds that based upon Bureau of Labor Statistics figures between 1995-1997 “rents
slightly outpaced income . . . for the 20% of U.S. households with the lowest
incomes.” Id. at 15; see also NAT’L LAW CTR. ON HOMELESSNESS & POVERTY, OUT OF
SIGHT—OUT OF MIND ii (1998) [hereinafter OUT OF SIGHT] (finding that a survey of
50 U.S. cities revealed that between 17 and 37% of individuals “are unable to afford
the fair market rent for an efficiency apartment in their metropolitan area”).
   27. See WAITING IN VAIN, supra note 26, at 15 (finding that the number of housing
units that rent for less than $300 decreased by 13% between 1996 and 1998). HUD
indicates that lack of access to housing for low-income persons is precipitated also by
the lack of housing assistance provided by HUD as a result of a withdrawal of
Government support. See id. at 16. A further hurdle to the provision of affordable
housing is the failure of owners of project-based Section 8 housing to renew their
contracts with HUD, where there is little financial incentive to do so because HUD
cannot offer competitive market rents. See id. at 16-17.
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number of low-income
renters exceeded the number of low-income housing units by 4.4 million. See Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities, Press Release, In Search of Shelter: The Growing Shortage of
Affordable Rental Housing (visited Nov. 7, 1999), at http://www.cbpp.org/615hous-
pr.htm. Although low-income households should pay only 30% of their income on
housing, 82% of these families used more than 30% of their income for housing. See
id. Where low-income people are required to maintain housing with more than one-
third of their income, finding and retaining affordable housing while homeless is a
significant challenge. See id.

assistance promptly due to this shortage are placed on waiting lists
that may result in a wait anywhere between a few months to several
                  28
years for housing. Some of the longest wait times are in large urban
areas, such as New York where the wait time for public and Section 8
         29                30
housing is eight years.         Other cities have refused to accept
applications for at least one affordable housing program because of
                                      31
the length of the existing wait lists.
  Earnings from employment may assist homeless people in
obtaining basic necessities and, in some cases, housing, but
homelessness is not solved through work alone. The National Law
Center on Homelessness & Poverty explains that a person working
forty hours per week at minimum wage still cannot afford fair market
     32                                                              33

Some homeless people work as day laborers or hold part-time or even

   28. See WAITING IN VAIN, supra note 26, at 7-8 (finding that in 1998 the average
waiting time nationwide for public housing was eleven months and for Section 8
housing was twenty-eight months).
   29. HUD provides two types of Section 8 housing. The first, and most common
form, is the Section 8 rental voucher program, where voucher recipients may lease
privately owned housing and pay approximately 30% of their income for that
housing. HUD then provides the difference between the tenant’s share of rent and
the total rent charged by the landlord. See U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., Section
8 Program Fact Sheet (visited Sept. 17, 2000), at http://www.hud.gov/section8.html.
The second type of Section 8 housing, project-based Section 8, provides a subsidy to
owners of buildings who reserve units for Section 8 holders. Forty percent of all units
designated for recipients of Section 8 assistance are reserved for families at or below
30% of the local area median income. See U.S. DEP’T OF HOUS. & URBAN DEV., RENTAL
HOUSING ASSISTANCE—THE WORSENING CRISIS 9 (2000) [hereinafter THE WORSENING
CRISIS].
   30. See WAITING IN VAIN, supra note 26, at 8 (finding that, in addition to the
lengthy wait in New York, wait times for public housing in other cities include “6
years in Oakland, and up to 5 years in Washington, D.C. and Cleveland,” and that
Section 8 housing waiting times are 5 years in Memphis, up to 5 years in Chicago, 7
years in Houston, up to “10 years in Newark, and 10 years in Los Angeles”); see also
COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP, supra note 16, at 7-8 (finding that 267 homeless families
remain on the wait list for family emergency shelter in the District of Columbia).
   31. See U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS, supra note 18, at 88 (noting that 44% of
survey cities stopped accepting applications for assisted housing programs).
   32. HUD determines the fair market rent (FMR) of housing by “estimat[ing] . . .
rent plus the cost of utilities, except telephone. [FMRs] are housing market wide
estimates of rents that provide opportunities to rent standard quality housing
throughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in
competition . . . . FMRs are set at the 40th percentile rent—the dollar amount below
which 40% of standard quality rental housing units rent.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113 (2000).
   33. See OUT OF SIGHT, supra note 26, at i. The National Law Center also suggests
that a person subsisting on Supplemental Security Income (a benefit for blind,
elderly, or people with disabilities) will not be able to afford housing at the fair
market rent in any of the cities surveyed. See id. at 2.

Consequently, they cannot secure housing.
   In addition, the unemployment rate has increased in many cities.

In contrast to the national decreased rate of joblessness, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development found that one in

an unemployment rate that is 75% or more above the national
average and one in fifteen cities has an unemployment rate that is

  Moreover, the number of shelter spaces woefully fails to meet
demand. The U.S. Conference of Mayors found that although the
                                                                  42
number of shelter spaces for homeless people increased by 15%, the
unmet need is great. The study found that 23% of shelter requests by
                                                       43
homeless people went unmet during the last year even though
                                      44
shelter requests increased by 15%. The Law Center reports that
none of the 50 cities surveyed have enough shelter spaces for the
                                                                 45
number of homeless people in that city on any given day.             In
Washington, D.C., for example, a family must often wait over six
                     46
months for shelter.
  Therefore, in a great number of cities in the United States,
homeless people often do not have any other choice but to live on
           47
the street. Until the needs of homeless people are met through
social services, arresting and citing homeless people will not relieve
homelessness and certainly will not reduce the presence of homeless
people in public places. If judicial responses to these ordinances
identify these deficiencies, localities may consider alternative means
to eliminating homelessness.

proponents of anti-camping and sleeping ordinances, suggesting that homeless
advocates want to establish a right to live on the street. See Teir, supra note 13, at 257
(“[M]any ‘homeless advocates’ and civil libertarians have championed the ‘right’ to
live on the street, sleep in the public place of one’s choosing, beg in any place and in
any manner one pleases, and to essentially be exempt from standards of conduct that

other activities in public locations ranges from creating more aesthetic urban areas
to preventing crime. See Teir, supra note 13, at 291 (suggesting that ordinances

which combat “street-level disorder,” including panhandling and sleeping in public,
are aimed at reducing crime and making public places more desirable for the
general population); see also E. J. Dionne, Jr., A Broken-Windows Approach to Crime,
WASH. POST, Dec. 29, 1996, at C7 (discussing Kelling and Coles’ “Broken Windows”
approach to “aggressive panhandling, and preventing public parks from being taken
over by homeless people”). The “broken windows” approach to urban renewal
derives its name from the following analogy:
     If a factory or office window is broken, passersby observing it will conclude
     that no one cares or no one is in charge. In time, a few will begin throwing
     rocks to break more windows. Soon all the windows will be broken, and now
     passersby will think that, not only is no one in charge of the building, no one
     is in charge of the street on which it faces. Only the young, the criminal, or
     the foolhardy have any business on an unprotected avenue, and so more and
     more citizens will abandon the street to those they assume prowl it. Small
     disorders lead to larger and larger ones, and perhaps even to crime.
James Q. Wilson, Foreword to GEORGE L. KELLING & CATHERINE M. COLES, FIXING
BROKEN WINDOWS xv (1996). Nevertheless, attempts to create order in urban areas
by attacking homeless people through the use of anti-camping, sleeping and begging
ordinances are misplaced. See Maria Foscarinis, Wrong Approach to Homelessness, WASH.
POST, Jan. 13, 1997, at A16 (stating that the “broken windows” approach obscures the
issue of homelessness). As Foscarinis asserts in her response to an editorial
supporting the application of the “broken windows” theory on homeless people’s
presence in public places, “[p]eople must be somewhere, and as long as they have no
private space, they will be in public. At most, criminalizing their use of public space
will move them temporarily into jails and prisons—only to be released back onto the
streets.” Id. Therefore, the only approach to addressing the presence of homeless
people in public places is to provide such basic services as shelter, housing, and
income assistance that will prevent people from being forced to live on the streets.
See id. (suggesting that a more effective way than the “broken windows” approach is
for communities to guarantee that all its members have a place to go).
    49. See OUT OF SIGHT, supra note 26, at ii (finding that between 1996 and 1998,
12% of the 49 cities surveyed enacted ordinances banning begging and 18% of the

Protection Clause, and overbreadthness.          Although these legal
theories proved somewhat successful in challenging anti-camping
ordinances, the most successful argument relies on the Eighth
              55                                         56
Amendment prohibition against punishment for status.
   The notion of a status crime originated in the Supreme Court case
                          57
of Robinson v. California where the Court examined a California
                                                                      58
statute that made it a crime to “be addicted to the use of narcotics.”
The Court found that where a statute could make “the ‘status’
narcotic addiction a criminal offense, for which the offender may be
                                               59
prosecuted ‘at any time before he reforms,’” such a statute is “an
infliction of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth
                                60
and Fourteenth Amendments.”
   Six years later, the Supreme Court considered the application of
                             61

public drunkenness.           Petitioner claimed that his conviction
constituted a violation of the Eighth Amendment as cruel and
                        63
unusual punishment. The Court distinguished Powell’s claim from
the holding in Robinson by finding that Powell was arrested and
                                                                       64
convicted for being drunk in public and not for being an alcoholic.
Thus, the Court found that the Texas public drunkenness statute was
                                            65
constitutional, as it did not punish status, but acts and behaviors that
require “the moral accountability of an individual for his antisocial
        66
deeds.”
   In 1992, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Florida decided the seminal case in the field of homeless rights—
                           67
Pottinger v. City of Miami. The court found that the City of Miami’s
practice of arresting homeless persons for engaging in basic activities
of daily life—including sleeping and eating—constituted cruel and
unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment as punishment
           68
for status. The court distinguished the life situations of homeless
class members from the petitioner in Powell, suggesting that
                                               69
homelessness rarely, if ever, is a choice.        In addition, the court
found that the Powell plurality did not consider homeless people in its
                                                               70
analysis, specifically those people who cannot find shelter. Justice
White, however, addressed this issue in his concurrence in Powell:
       Although many chronics have homes, many others do not. For all
       practical purposes the public streets may be home for these
       unfortunates, not because their disease compels them to be there,
       but because, drunk or sober, they have no place else to go and no place
       else to be when they are drinking. This is more a function of economic
       station than of disease, although the disease may lead to destitution

       and perpetuate that condition.
   Despite the court’s findings in Pottinger, other courts have declined
                                                           72
to extend the Robinson protection to similar ordinances. Tobe v. City
of Santa Ana is one of the most recent decisions rejecting Eighth
Amendment protection to homeless people arrested under such
            73
ordinances.
                                      74
   The ordinance at issue in Tobe barred camping and storing
                                         75
personal belongings in public places. Plaintiffs launched a multi-
prong attack on the ordinance, arguing that it: was unconstitutional
as an impermissible restriction on the right to travel; punished

   72. See Joyce v. San Francisco, 846 F. Supp. 843, 857 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (finding
that the “Matrix” program of enforcing anti-homeless ordinances did not violate the
Eighth Amendment, as homelessness is not a status); cf. Johnson v. Dallas, 61 F.3d
442, 443-44 (5th Cir. 1995) (finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to appeal an
anti-sleeping ordinance because they had not been arrested under the statute);
Davison v. Tucson, 924 F. Supp. 989, 992 (D. Ariz. 1996) (denying a preliminary
injunction to homeless plaintiffs because they did not meet their burden of proving
probable success on the merits of their Eighth Amendment and Equal Protection
claims).
   73. 892 P.2d 1145, 1150 (Cal. 1995) (finding that the ordinance “does not
impermissibly restrict the right to travel, does not permit punishment for status, and
is not constitutionally vague or overbroad . . . .”).
   74. The Tobe ordinance was not the city of Santa Ana’s first attempt to remove
homeless people from the city. See id. at 1151. The plaintiffs in Tobe argued “that the
ordinance was the culmination of a four-year effort by Santa Ana to expel homeless
persons.” Id. A 1988 policy of removing homeless people from certain locations,
disposing of sleeping bags and other belongings, and confiscating shopping carts
resulted in a lawsuit that the city settled in 1990. See id. In a memorandum, a Santa
Ana city official wrote “[t]he City Council has developed a policy that the vagrants
are no longer welcome in the City of Santa Ana.” Id. at 1177 (Mosk, J., dissenting).

Simon, The Criminalization of Homelessness in Santa Ana, California: A Case Study, 29

   75. Santa Ana Municipal Code § 10-402 on Unlawful Camping states: “It shall be
unlawful for any person to camp, occupy camp facilities or use camp paraphernalia
in the following areas, except as otherwise provided: (a) any street; (b) any public
parking lot or public areas, improved or unimproved.” SANTA ANA, CAL., CODE § 10-
402 (1992), reprinted in Tobe, 892 P.2d 1150. Section 10-403 on Storage of Personal
Property in Public Places states: “It shall be unlawful for any person to store personal
property, including camp facilities and camp paraphernalia, in the following areas,
except as otherwise provided by resolution of the City Council: (a) any park; (b) any
street; (c) any public parking lot or public area, improved or unimproved.” SANTA
ANA, CAL., CODE § 10-403 (1992), reprinted in Tobe, 392 P.2d at 1150-51. The
ordinance defines camp, camp facilities, and camp paraphernalia under § 10-401 as,
    (a) Camp means to pitch or occupy camp facilities; to use camp
    paraphernalia;
    (b) Camp facilities include, but are not limited to, tents, huts, or temporary
    shelters;

homeless people for their status; and was vague and overbroad. The
                                         77
court rejected all of plaintiff’s claims. The court distinguished the
case from Robinson and concluded that the Santa Ana municipal
                                                 78
ordinance was punishing conduct, not status.           The Tobe court,
however, suggested that the defense of necessity might be available
                                                               79
for “persons whose violation of the ordinance is involuntary.” The
court seemingly provided this “exception” in response to an assertion
made at oral argument by the senior deputy district attorney that
“truly homeless” persons may be able to assert the defense of
          80
necessity.   The court suggested that the statute should not be
enforced against “persons who have no alternative to ‘camping’ or
                                                    81
placing ‘camp paraphernalia’ on public property.” It is this window

   76. See Tobe, 892 P.2d at 1150 (detailing the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims that
the ordinance restricted the right to travel, was vague, punished status, and was
overbroad).
   77. See id. at 1166-69 (finding that the ordinance punished conduct, not status;
clearly specified the conduct it prohibited; and was a constitutional imposition of
police power).
   78. See id. at 1167 (“Assuming arguendo that the accuracy of the declarants’
descriptions of the circumstances in which they were cited under the ordinance, it is
far from clear that none had alternatives to either the condition of being homeless
or the conduct that led to homelessness and to the citations.”).
   79. Id. at 1155.
   80. See id. at 1155 n.8 (stating that a senior deputy district attorney conceded that
a necessity defense might be available to persons who have no alternative to
“camping” on public property).
   81. See id. (listing the senior deputy district attorney’s comments at oral
argument). Professor Fred Bosselman suggests that the Tobe court may have been
influenced by the Northern District of Texas’ decision in Johnson v. Dallas, 860 F.
Supp. 344 (N.D. Tex. 1994), rev’d on other grounds, 61 F.3d 442 (5th Cir. 1995). See
Fred P. Bosselman, Camping By the Homeless as a Use of Land, 34 A.L.I.–A.B.A. 1119,
1123 (1995) (stating that an issue left unresolved in Tobe was the subject of the
Johnson case). In Johnson, the court found that the ordinance violated the Eighth
Amendment and that “at any given time there are persons in Dallas who have no
place to go, who could not find shelter even if they wanted to—and many of them do
want to—and who would be turned away from shelter for a variety of reasons.” See id.
(citing Johnson, 860 F. Supp. at 350).
   The California Supreme Court’s use of the necessity defense to avoid
unconstitutional applications of this ordinance is similar to the same court’s creation
of a constitutional defense for chronic alcoholics to an ordinance that prohibited
public drunkenness. See Sundance v. Municipal Ct., 729 P.2d 80, 89 (Cal. 1986).
The court upheld a trial court’s ruling that the defense would be available:
     [I]f he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he is “(1) unable to
     refrain from drinking alcohol to the point where he is unable to care for
     himself and others, and (2) unable (a) by reason of the disease, or
     (b) indigency, to refrain from being in public while intoxicated.”
Id. To the extent that homelessness becomes a chronic condition when a city, such
as Santa Ana, does not provide sufficient resources to assist homeless people in
moving into housing, the two defenses are analogous. Compare Tobe v. City of Santa
Ana, 892 P.2d 1145, 1155 (Cal. 1995) (suggesting that an involuntary violation of the
anti-camping ordinance may create a due-process-based necessity defense), with
Sundance, 729 P.2d at 89 (upholding a trial court’s criteria for a constitutional
defense that may be used by a chronic alcoholic).

  Although not codified in some jurisdictions, the necessity defense,
justification, or choice of evils doctrine can be traced to 19th Century
           84
England. The defense promotes the notion that although the harm
caused should be avoided, the “harm is outweighed by the need to
avoid an even greater harm and to further a greater societal
           85
interest.” Although the number and content of the elements to the
                                                86

elements of the defense.
   Historically, the defense of necessity was distinguishable from that
           89                                                         90
of duress, but this distinction no longer exists in modern case law.
The pre-eminent federal authority on the use of the necessity defense
                           91
is United States v. Bailey, where the Supreme Court analyzed the use
                                                        92
of the necessity defense in a prison escape case.           The Court
recognized that whether under the defense of necessity or duress, if a
reasonable legal alternative exists such that the defendant could have
                                                   93
avoided violating the law, both defenses will fail.

   88. See MODEL PENAL CODE § 3.02 (1962). The rule, titled “Justification
Generally: Choice of Evils,” states:
     1) Conduct which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid a harm or evil to
     himself or to another is justifiable, provided that:
     a) the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater than that
     sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged; and
     b) neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions
     or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved; and
     c) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not
     otherwise plainly appear.
     2) When the actor was reckless or negligent in bringing about the situation
     requiring a choice of harms or evils or in appraising the necessity for his
     conduct, the justification afforded by this Section is unavailable in a
     prosecution for any offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case
     may be, suffices to establish culpability.
Id. (emphasis added).
   89. The defense of duress is defined as:
     A person’s unlawful threat (1) which causes the defendant reasonably to
     belief that the only way to avoid imminent death or serious bodily injury to
     himself or to another is to engage in conduct which violates the literal terms
     of the criminal law, and (2) which causes the defendant to engage in that
     conduct, gives the defendant the defense of duress . . . to the crime in
     question unless that crime consists of intentionally killing an innocent third
     person.
SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW, supra note 4, § 5.3, at 614. The Model Penal Code § 2.09
defines duress as:
     An affirmative defense that the actor engaged in the conduct charged to
     constitute an offense because he was coerced to do so by the use of, or a
     threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another,
     that a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable
     to resist.

modern cases tend to blur the distinction between the defenses of duress and
necessity such that courts may decide to disregard the distinctions and instead
examine the underlying policies of the defenses).

2000]                                               IN RE EICHORN                        341

   When raising the defense of necessity in the context of
homelessness, attorneys may be concerned with whether to
                                                                    94
characterize a homeless client’s situation as “involuntary.”
Voluntariness is, of course, a relative term. A homeless person may
have made some type of choice months or years prior to living on the
street that in some way resulted in a loss of housing. It is, however,
hard to say that living on the street is “voluntary” because of its
                                    95
relationship to a previous choice. Although some commentators
suggest that volition is an unnecessary element in determining the
                                                       96
constitutional application of anti-homeless ordinances, the concept
                                 97
continues to appear in case law.

threat to his relative because he had the opportunity to contact the police, but did
not).

Lifestyle Choices: Judicial Images of Homeless Litigants and Implications for Legal Advocates,
45 BUFF. L. REV. 687, 708-15 (1997) (explaining that although lawyers won some
important cases by portraying their homeless clients as “unfortunate victims of forces
beyond their control,” this approach may cause significant risks of defeat, especially
when judges believe that homelessness is a lifestyle choice).
    95. See Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus; Memorandum of Points and
Authorities at 28, 31; In re Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 535 (Ct. App. 1998) (No.
G022777) [hereinafter Petition for Writ] (arguing that the trial court was in error in
finding that defendant’s homelessness “was the result of personal choice” because
the defendant had been homeless since 1982). “It may be that for many,
homelessness is at some level ‘voluntary.’ But the range of choices available to
homeless individuals may be so narrow and so unsatisfying that a condition many of
us cannot imagine being freely chosen is indeed the least of all possible evils.”
Daniels, supra note 94, at 716.
   An illustration of choices that could confuse the issue of voluntariness is found in
the story of a woman and her boyfriend who have lived in a van in San Francisco for
approximately two years. See Evelyn Nieves, Living in a Balky Van, Trying to Move
Ahead, N.Y. TIMES, Dec. 19, 1999, at NE25. The couple became homeless when the
boyfriend’s relatives evicted them to sell the property. See id. At the time, the woman
was enrolled in travel school and her boyfriend had just quit his job. See id. Because
of her debt, the woman moved into her van because she could not afford housing
and invited her boyfriend to join her. See id. She dropped out of school and now
works two jobs, while her boyfriend receives income through a city program that
helps steer unemployed persons into jobs. See id. Their funds are used to pay
outstanding debt and to buy bare necessities. See id. Because living in a vehicle is
illegal in San Francisco, police have called the couple habitual offenders. See id. The
couple’s alternatives are limited, however, given that the number of homeless people
in San Francisco has been estimated at 11,000 to 16,000 persons and there are
generally only 1,359 emergency shelter spaces with 250-280 additional spaces in the
winter. See OUT OF SIGHT, supra note 26, at 4.
   The point at which one choice can be said to have caused the couple’s current
situation is unclear. Excessive debt that accrued over time is too gradual to
constitute a choice. Although the couple chose to live in the van, the story suggests
that the lack of shelter space may have made that choice their only adequate option.
    96. See Tier, supra note 13, at 267 (maintaining that states and cities do not need
to limit their criminal laws to voluntary conduct, but rather, states and cities may
include involuntary acts as causes for convictions).

   Voluntariness is inherent to the necessity defense. To raise the
defense, a defendant must have chosen between two acts and, in
                                              99
doing so, must have chosen the “lesser evil.” The Tobe court’s use of
the term involuntary indicates that the necessity defense would be
available only to persons whose “violation of the ordinance is
              100
involuntary.” This statement sets up an interesting contradiction in
which a defendant who “voluntarily” chooses the lesser of two harms
                                          101
renders his or her decision involuntary. In addition, the Tobe court
emphasized that a trial court first must determine that a person is
“involuntarily homeless” before deciding whether the defendant
                                       102
“involuntarily” violated the ordinance.
                        103
   Professor John Parry asserts that the theory of voluntarism “is an
                                                        104
inadequate explanation of criminal responsibility”          and that
determining whether the defendant acted with volition requires the
                                                  105
fact finder to evaluate the defendant’s conduct.      Professor Parry
argues that this evaluation is paramount to consequentialism, or the


defense).
   98. See Schulkind, supra note 86, at 85 (maintaining that the purpose of the
necessity defense is to promote results that are socially desirable, and as a result this
defense evaluates the quality and wisdom of a defendant’s voluntary choices);
Lawrence P. Tiffany & Carl A. Anderson, Legislating the Necessity Defense in Criminal
Law, 52 DENV. U. L. REV. 839, 841 (1975) (“The necessity defense always involves a
voluntary choice on the part of the actor.”).
   99. See Robinson, supra note 85, at 83 (suggesting that burning a field to fire
block a raging forest fire would satisfy all the elements of arson, but the fire starter
would likely have a complete defense if his actions saved 10,000 lives, as his action is
the “lesser evil”).
  100. See Tobe, 892 P.2d at 1155 (holding that a due-process-based necessity defense
may occur when violation of the ordinance is involuntary); id. at 1155-56 n.8 (“A
senior deputy district attorney expressed his opinion at oral argument before this
court that a necessity defense might be available to ‘truly homeless’ persons and said
that prosecutorial discretion would be exercised.”).
  101. Such a distinction is not without foundation, as the following passage
indicates:
    [T]he word “necessity” is only used by the defence [sic] to a charge of crime
    in what is the vain hope of making the criminal deed appear to have been
    the result either of involuntary conduct, or of some irresistible external
    compulsion, instead of what it really was, the result of a voluntary choice of
    that alternative which the accused felt to be the less disagreeable to himself.

  102. See Tobe, 892 P.2d at 1157 (determining that, because none of the petitioners

balancing of social harms, and thus voluntarism becomes less
             107
significant.      The balancing of harms is, however, an imperfect test
because there is no guide as to what harms should be balanced or
                         108
how to balance them. Where a conflict in values exists, the weight
                                 109
given to each harm is unclear.
   Nevertheless, the theoretical move to consequentialism is crucial

for attorneys representing homeless people. Professor Wes Daniels
argues that advocates must escape the realm of proving that their
                                       111
clients are involuntarily homeless. He notes that cases have been
lost because “judges are convinced that homelessness is a ‘lifestyle
         112
choice.’”        Although the balancing of harms test is somewhat
ambiguous, it allows the defense attorney to present alternatives to
                 113
the violation.       The alternatives, or harms avoided, might include
                     114
sleep deprivation or the risk of personal harm in going from shelter

REV. 859, 863 (2000) (“Consequentialism is not easy to define concisely, but its
central tenet is that acting morally is simply a matter of acting so as to maximize the

states or affairs are objectively better than others, and that one morally ought always
to act so as to bring about the best possible state of affairs.”); see also supra note 88

  107. See Parry, supra note 9, at 422 (explaining that voluntarism engages in the

                                                             118
necessity defense only need meet a minimum standard, many
courts do not allow the defense to reach the jury where the court
finds that the defendant has failed to meet one or more of the
           119
elements.      The tension between a judge’s role in determining
whether the necessity defense should be allowed and the jury’s role in
determining the applicability of the defense was the foundation for
                             120
the appeal in In re Eichorn.

2000]                                               IN RE EICHORN                   345

      IV. IN RE EICHORN AND APPLICATION OF THE NECESSITY DEFENSE
   James Eichorn was convicted of a misdemeanor violation of the
                                                         121
Santa Ana Municipal Code Article VIII, § 10-402, which bans
                          122
“Unlawful Camping.”           Mr. Eichorn was one of fifteen homeless
people police cited on January 25, 1994, for sleeping in the Santa Ana
                 123
Civic Center. All of the homeless individuals cited demurred to the
                                                     124
complaints against them except for Mr. Eichorn. Through various
appeals, the same group of homeless individuals became the plaintiffs
          125                                                      126
in Tobe and the City of Santa Ana stayed their prosecution.            In
1995, the city reinstituted these cases, but the cases were dismissed on
grounds of lack of speedy trial or other arrangements because the city
                               127
failed to enter a formal stay. Mr. Eichorn’s case was the only one of
                         128
15 cases to go to trial.
   The trial court ruled that Mr. Eichorn could not utilize the
necessity defense because he failed to prove that he avoided a
                                  129
“significant, imminent evil,” the first element of the necessity
defense, by sleeping in the Santa Ana Civic Center on January 25,
      130
1993.         The court found that Mr. Eichorn was “not involuntarily
                                       131
homeless on the night in question” because he chose not to go to

request the judge held:
     I’m inclined to deny the request for the physician because I think that the
     area the physician will testify to as you proposed in the motion is something
     that jurors are well aware of. I mean, it doesn’t take an expert to tell us that,
     to convince a person, that there are ill effects that arise from sleep
     deprivation. I don’t need the doctor to tell me that the defendant had to
     sleep somewhere.

the city’s shelter. The court also found that the defendant should
have attempted to obtain housing from relatives and applied for
                 133
public benefits.
   The Court of Appeal for the Fourth District of California rejected
the trial court’s determination that the defendant did not avoid a
significant evil by sleeping at the Civic Center, and as a result, found
that the defendant should have been allowed to assert the necessity
                 134
defense at trial. Although the court delineated six elements to the
                     135
necessity defense, the court focused only briefly on the first element
                                           136
in response to the trial court’s ruling.         The court found that by
sleeping in the civic center, the defendant may have been avoiding
                                             137
the “significant evil” of sleep deprivation.
   The importance of the opinion, however, derives from the court’s
recognition of housing barriers faced by Eichorn and other homeless
                                                          138
persons due to a lack of resources in Santa Ana, and how such
barriers permitted the invocation of a necessity defense for violation
of the ordinance. The court examined the trial testimony presented
by several advocates for homeless people and local agency officials,
each of whom explained what few resources Eichorn had available
                                                      139

                                                    140
housing (including the lack of shelter) and income.

                                     A. Housing, Shelter, and Income
   At trial, various witnesses addressed homelessness in Santa Ana and
Orange County and discussed the limited resources available to
homeless individuals. First, Professor James Meeker from the
University of California at Irvine, in citing his 1993 study on
homelessness, stated that for the 3,000 homeless people in Orange
County during January and February, the supply of affordable
                                          141
housing had continually decreased.            Moreover, he explained that
most of the homeless individuals in the county could not secure
accommodations because they had “lost jobs and could not afford
            142
housing.”        Second, Timothy Shaw, Executive Director of the
Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, testified that, in 1993,
1,500 homeless people lived within Santa Ana, yet the county only
supplied 118 shelter beds year-round and an additional 125 beds
                                                      143
when the armory opened during the winter.                  Finally, Maria
Mendoza, the county’s homeless coordinator, explained that on the
                                                                       144
night of Eichorn’s arrest, the armory was full beyond its capacity.
She further testified that Eichorn had spent twenty nights at the
                                      145
armory in December and January.
   June Marcott, the program manager for the Orange County food
stamps and general relief program, testified about the monetary
                                  146
resources available to Eichorn. She found that when Eichorn was
not employed, he could receive $307 per month as part of a work

immediately affected by housing, which includes vacancy rates and the ratio of
affordable units to low income individuals, and income variables, which includes the
poverty rate and income per capita).
  141. See Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 537; see also Petition for Writ, supra note 95, at
32 n.74, Eichorn (No. GO22777) (stating that “in 1993, over 200,000 County residents

units available at under $300 a month.”).

program if he worked nine days a month and submitted four job
                   147
applications daily. Eichorn, however, last received general relief in
November 1990, but was terminated for failure to submit a job search
report and his subsequent applications in March and June, 1992 were
        148
denied.

                                                    B. Application
  In focusing its opinion on an element of the necessity defense, the
California court changed the focus of the analysis from volition, as
                    149
prescribed by Tobe, to consequentialism. The court found that
“[t]here was substantial if not uncontradicted evidence that
[Eichorn] slept in the civic center because his alternatives were
           150                     151
inadequate and economic forces were primarily to blame for his

  147. See id. at 538 (describing the requirements of the work program).
  148. See id. At trial, Ms. Marcott testified she could not determine why the
petitioner’s application for general relief was denied in June 1992. See Petition for
Writ, supra note 95, at 17 n.28, Eichorn (No. G022777). Because there was no
evidence that the petitioner received explanation of the reinstatement process,
petitioner argued that “[g]iven that the county’s own expert could not determine the
reasons for her office denying relief, Eichorn should hardly be penalized for failing
to navigate properly the intricacies of this highly-regulated government program.”
Id.
  149. See supra notes 79-81 and accompanying text (discussing the Tobe court’s
suggestion that the necessity defense could be used by homeless people who
involuntarily violated the ordinance).
  150. The trial court found that Eichorn had adequate alternatives because he
could have slept in “other buildings, nearby churches,” “rear stairs, rear doors.”
Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 540 n.4. The court also suggested that Eichorn travel to
another city. See id. (“Is [it] a reasonable alternative . . . walking a mile or so [to a
nearby city without a camping ordinance]? Stroll on a nice sunny day, find a cushy
spot in Tustin, in a city park and make his home there.”).
   The Court of Appeals responded that “neither trespassing on private property nor
walking to a different city was an adequate alternative . . . an individual who has no
reasonable alternative to sleeping in a public place in Santa Ana need not travel in
search of streets and other public places where he can catch his 40 winks.” Id.
  151. The acknowledgement of economic factors that led to Eichorn’s condition
does not indicate necessarily that courts will begin to recognize the defense of
economic necessity. In State v. Moe, the Supreme Court of Washington held that
“[e]conomic necessity has never been accepted as a defense to a criminal charge.”
24 P.2d 638, 640 (Wash. 1933) (refusing to adopt the defense to charges of larceny
and rioting). In Moe, the defendants, during a demonstration for a greater allowance
of flour, raided a local grocery store after the Red Cross commissary chairman
denied their request. See id. at 639. The court reasoned that “were [the economic
necessity defense] ever countenanced, it would leave to the individual the right to
take the law into his own hands.” See id. at 640. Although deciding to rest in a
private or public place in order to avoid sleep deprivation could be analogized to
stealing groceries from a store in an effort to avoid starvation, the Eichorn court does
not appear to be making new law in this area. Eichorn’s economic situation
constituted only one factor that led to his homelessness, and the court acknowledged
this fact in determining that the defense of necessity should be allowed. See Eichorn,
81 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 540. The court did not state that it should be an element or basis
for a defense. See id. (lacking language that an economic factor must be present to
invoke the necessity defense).
FASANELLIPP.DOC                                                        8/15/2001 11:30 AM

                           152
predicament.”      This statement by the court, the focus of which is
the adequacy of alternatives, involved a balancing of harms. The trial
court’s finding that Eichorn “was not involuntarily homeless on the
                    153
night in question,” is irrelevant to whether Eichorn could raise the
                   154
necessity defense.      The court did not analyze why Eichorn was
denied public assistance, why he was not working at the time he was
cited, or why he did not contact relatives or travel to another
          155
location, each of which may have been used to determine whether
                                 156
he was involuntarily homeless.       The court made clear that once
                                                                  157
Eichorn proved the basic elements of the necessity defense, he
could evoke such defense without inquiry into the causes of his
               158
homelessness. Thus, if a defendant shows that: (1) the shelter was
full, (2) there were more homeless people in the area than shelter
space, and (3) he or she did not have funds to afford housing or a
motel room, then any alternative to sleeping in public, such as staying
awake and moving around, will be inadequate to rebut application of

  152. Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 540.
  153. Id. at 538.
  154. The defense team argued that the causes of Eichorn’s homelessness were
irrelevant in considering whether he could invoke the necessity defense at trial. See
Petition for Writ, supra note 95, at 31, Eichorn (G022777) (asserting that in Robinson,
the question did not involve whether a drug addict voluntarily chose to become
addicted, but “whether the defendant’s present conduct is a proper object of the
criminal laws”). In addition, Eichorn contended that when he (i) had required food
stamps, (ii) was denied general assistance, (iii) had regularly sought employment,
and (iv) could not stay with relatives, the obligation imposed on him to find housing
became impossible to fulfill. See id. at 32-33 (arguing that these factors demonstrated
Eichorn had no reasonable alternative but to sleep in public).
  155. Eichorn, a veteran of the Vietnam War, testified that after losing a job he
moved to Santa Ana and drove an ice cream truck. See Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr. at 537
(narrating how he had no place to live before he moved to Santa Ana). He lived in a
motel room while driving the truck, but lost his job. See id. He then worked in the
county’s casual labor office until that office closed. See id. He lived in the streets,
usually near the civic center where other homeless people slept, when he did not
have enough funds to stay in a motel. See id. (testifying that he lived in a motel only
when he had saved enough money, but most inexpensive motels had raised prices).
He could not recall whether he actually had attempted to sleep at a shelter the night
of January 25, 1993, or whether he had believed it was full. See id. at 538.
Nevertheless, he had been “turned away from the Armory in the past and had a
‘nervous walk’ back to the civic center.” Id. at 538. A “nervous walk” may refer to the
presence of gangs in the area between the Armory and the civic center. See Return to

the defense. Less clear now is, if shelter space was available, but a
defendant feared traveling to the shelter or thought the shelter was
unsafe, whether the shelter space would be considered a viable
            160
alternative?     Regardless, the court’s shift from volition to a
balancing of harms and alternatives analysis through the application
of the necessity defense provides a new opportunity for homeless
advocates to defend their clients.

                                        C. Impact upon Other Cities
  Proponents of the Santa Ana ordinance now face the possibility
that all persons cited under the ordinance will contest the violation
by invoking the necessity defense. In other cities, where courts have
upheld anti-camping and sleeping ordinances as constitutional, the
necessity defense will be available to homeless people under the
Tobe/In re Eichorn theory if the violator shows that more homeless
people than shelter spaces exist and there is a lack of adequate
                            161
income to pay for housing. According to a National Law Center on
Homelessness & Poverty survey of fifty cities, each city examined had
fewer shelter spaces than homeless people as well as inadequate
income opportunities to assist homeless people in acquiring
          162
housing.
  If other courts follow, and permit the necessity defense, legislatures
will be forced to reconsider anti-camping and sleeping ordinances for

  159. See id. at 536 (finding that Eichorn, in presenting these facts, presented
sufficient evidence for a jury determination of whether his criminal violation was to
prevent a significant evil). The court does not require the defendant to prove that
he did not have friends or relatives in the area with whom he could not stay. See id. at
538. Although the defendant testified at trial that his mother and step-father lived in
a nearby area, he would not stay with them because “he was ‘an adult responsible for’
himself,” the Court of Appeal did not analyze this portion of Eichorn’s testimony and
did not mention the possibility that he had other relatives or friends in the area. See
id. at 538 (lacking such discussion).
  160. See Daniels, supra note 94, at 716-17 n.168 (citing Pottinger v. City of Miami,
810 F. Supp. 1551, 1580 n.34 (S.D. Fl. 1992), for the proposition that shelter space
may not be a viable alternative when “the shelter is dangerous, drug infested, crime-
ridden or especially unsanitary” because a homeless person should not have to
choose between his health and possession, a place to sleep and possible arrest); see
also Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 540 (discussing only that Eichorn acted to prevent a
significant evil). The court did not mention Eichorn’s fear of harm as a possible
prevention of locating a reasonable alternative place to sleep.
  161. See Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 892 P.2d 1145, 1155 n.8 (Cal. 1995) (relying
upon a district attorney’s belief that while the ordinance will still be applied against
campers, the “truly homeless” will not be targeted due to prosecutorial discretion
and that homeless people will likely invoke the defense); see also Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr.
2d at 539 (citing Tobe as declining to decide how an anti-camping ordinance may be
unconstitutionally applied).

two main reasons. First, if a homeless defendant utilizes the necessity
defense and succeeds, the utility of the ordinance in deterring
                                        163                           164
homeless people from public areas or from the city in general,
                      165
will be undermined. The necessity defense defeats the goal of anti-
camping and sleeping ordinances—to eliminate the presence of
                                    166
homeless people in public areas —by acknowledging that violating
the ordinance presents the only reasonable choice for homeless
people. A homeless person who asserts the necessity defense and is
acquitted of the charge, will only continue to violate the ordinance
                                                                      167
until a reasonable alternative to sleeping outside materializes.
Therefore, the ordinance’s intended deterrent effect fails to exist
                                                          168
when a homeless defendant asserts the necessity defense. When an
ordinance ceases to have a deterrent value it constitutes bad public
        169
policy.     Thus, legislators will need to consider alternatives to the

  163. Some reports find that anti-camping and sleeping ordinances have little
deterrent effect regardless of the presence of the necessity defense. A recent article
in the New York Times, profiling a homeless man’s lawsuit against Mayor Guiliani for
police “crackdowns on the homeless,” states that “internal reports by the Department
of Homeless Services reflect that homeless people routed from one place showed up
somewhere else, or ebbed back to the old spot over time.” Nina Bernstein, Homeless
Man Presses Legal Battle Against Backdrop of New Crackdown, N.Y. TIMES, Nov. 22, 1999,
at B5; see also Jonathan P. Hicks, Hillary Clinton Attacks Arrests of the Homeless, N.Y.
TIMES, Dec. 1, 1999, at A1 (reporting that the First Lady criticized Mayor Guiliani for
his campaign to arrest homeless people by stating “[l]ocking people up for a day will
not take a single person off the streets”).
  164. See Foscarinis, supra note 50, at 22-25 (discussing the purposes of
criminalizing acts by homeless people including “to drive homeless residents out of
the city”).
  165. See Sundance v. Municipal Ct., 729 P.2d 80, 94-95 (Cal. 1986) (finding that
when an ordinance has no rehabilitative or deterrent effect upon chronic alcoholics,
a constitutional attack under the Eighth Amendment may be available).
  166. See Maria Foscarinis, Out of Sight-Out of Mind? The Continuing Trend Toward the
Criminalization of Homelessness, 6 GEO. J. ON POVERTY L. & POL’Y 145, 147 n.6 (1999)
(emphasizing that many cities, in enacting camping prohibitions, have expanded the
definition of camping beyond traditional activities to encompass homeless sleepers).
In fact, “73% of the 49 cities [from which information was available, see supra text
accompanying note 49 (listing the cities)] currently have ordinances prohibiting or
restricting sleeping or camping.” Id. at 150. See also Tier, supra note 13, at 266
(describing how certain urban anti-camping ordinances prohibit erecting tents or
other structures, cooking or storing personal items in public parks).
  167. See Bernstein, supra note 163, at B5 (citing a New York Department of
Homeless Services report that found when police or city officials move homeless
people from one area they often travel back to the original location over time).
  168. Invocation of the necessity defense eliminates the deterrent effect of an anti-
camping ordinance if one assumes that full prosecution will be sought under the
ordinance instead of the ordinance being used for mere citation purposes. See
Smith, supra note 56, at 328 n.168 (claiming that the necessity defense may not
frequently be employed because most “arrests of homeless people under anti-
sleeping laws usually fall short of final adjudication”).
  169. See Foscarinis, supra note 50, at 59-60 (“Criminalizing homelessness is poor
public policy for several reasons . . . . Perhaps the most fundamental, criminalization
responses do not and cannot work. Like all human beings, homeless people must
eat, sleep and occupy space.”).

ordinance.
   Second, this cycle of continued violations leads to another
consideration:        the broader social purpose of eliminating
homelessness. The availability of the necessity defense originates
from a locality’s lack of shelter space, income, and affordable
            171
housing. Proponents of quality of life programs that seek to
improve urban landscapes must understand that when cities lack
affordable housing, income, and shelter, anti-camping ordinances
will cease to have any effect on the number of homeless people in a
          172
locality.       Only an increase in affordable housing, income, and
shelter, rather than enforcement of anti-camping or sleeping
                                       173
ordinances, will reduce homelessness.
   Arrests and citations pursuant to anti-camping and sleeping
ordinances, together with the use of the necessity defense, also serve
to hinder judicial efficiency. The dissent in Tobe predicted that the
requirement that a defendant prove, on a case-by-case basis, he or she
was “truly homeless . . . would needlessly subject large numbers of
homeless persons to the criminal justice system for wholly innocuous
                                                                     174
conduct and overwhelm our already strained judicial resources.”

  170. See OUT OF SIGHT, supra note 26, at 53-61 (describing programs used as
alternatives to anti-camping and sleeping ordinances in Portland, OR; Omaha, NE;
San Francisco, CA; Dallas, TX; Washington, DC; New York, NY; West Hollywood, CA;
Seattle, WA; Glendale, CA; and Miami, FL.).
  171. See supra text accompanying note 160.
  172. For example, Rob Tier argues that because judges and advocates misperceive
the lack of affordable housing to be the overarching cause of homelessness, their
efforts to ensure the “right to live on the street, sleep in the public place of one’s
choosing, beg in any place and in any manner one pleases, and to essentially be
exempt from standard of conduct that apply to all others” jeopardizes the quality of
life in urban areas. Tier, supra note 13, at 261 (asserting that such efforts harm
communities, deteriorate neighborhoods and force people to abandon urban
centers due to the more aggressive behavior of homeless people). This argument
ignores the other factors, such as lack of shelter space and income maintenance,
which also cause homelessness. Furthermore, it assumes that homeless people, when
subject to laws that restrict behavior, will become “good citizens . . . capable of
obeying these new laws.” Id. at 263 (arguing that addicts, rather than homeless
people, engage in aggressive, anti-social behavior).
  173. Enforcement of these ordinances substantially decreases public support for
economic support for the homeless, thereby reducing the opportunity for homeless
people to receive increased funding for housing and shelters. One advocate notes
that “[t]hese regulations have a two-fold negative effect in that they both endanger
the ability of homeless people to survive and they reduce the incentive and the
opportunity for the public to respond to the needs of these people.” See Nancy
Wright, Not in Anyone’s Backyard: Ending the “Contest of Nonresponsibility” and
Implementing Long-Term Solutions to Homelessness, 2 GEO. J. ON FIGHTING POVERTY 163,
174 (1995) (describing how the diminution of economic funding for general
assistance support, emergency shelters and low-income housing closely relates to the
increasing use of anti-camping ordinances and panhandling statutes).

For example, if police cited or arrested each homeless person in
                     175

to relieve the judiciary of the potential case load burdens.
  Finally, the legislature must consider the effect that a citation
under the ordinance has on a homeless person. The trial court

notion of judicial efficiency); cf. Tier, supra note 13, at 268 (arguing that inquiry into
the housing and shelter availability compels an inappropriate judicial involvement
into “public housing and shelter spending in the jurisdiction”).
   The notion that the ordinance will become insulated from meaningful review has
proven to be an accurate prediction. Eichorn argued in his petition that the
ordinance violated equal protection when it prevented him from engaging in life-
sustaining acts. See Petition for Writ, supra note 95, at 37, Eichorn (No. G022777)
(stating that “[t]he Ordinance does not pass constitutional muster” because the right
to partake in life-sustaining activities is fundamental). He again argued the point lost
in Tobe, that the underlying purpose of the ordinance is to remove homeless people
from Santa Ana. See id. (“Despite the Ordinance’s facial neutrality, the Ordinance’s
true and principle purpose is to drive the homeless out of Santa Ana and to prevent
new homeless from entering the City.”); see also Tobe, 892 P.2d at 1159-60 (“We
cannot assume . . . that the sole purpose of the ordinance is simply to drive the
homeless out of Santa Ana.”).
   The city, however, ignores these arguments in its Return to the Petition, as did the
court. See Traverse to the People’s Return; Memorandum of Points and Authorities
at 1, In re Eichorn, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 535 (Ct. App. 1998) (No. G022777) (“The People
are . . . mysteriously quiet on the constitutional issue.”); see also In re Eichorn, 81 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 535, 540 (Ct. App. 1998) (“[B]ecause Eichorn is entitled to raise a necessity
defense to charges he violated the camping ordinance, we find no other
constitutional violations under the circumstances of this case.”). In addition,
Eichorn argued that the Santa Ana ordinance was distinguishable from the law in
Powell, where Justice Black concurred in finding a statute punishing public
drunkenness constitutional because it was consistent with the notions of deterrence,
isolation, and treatment. See Petition for Writ, supra note 95, at 19, Eichorn (No.
G022777) (citing Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 540-41 (1968)). In this case, Eichorn
could not be deterred because he had no choice but to sleep outside. He was not
isolated by the citation because authorities released him on his own recognizance.
Finally, he received 40 hours of community service, which seems misplaced given
that community service does not relieve the cause of his homelessness—namely lack
of housing, shelter, and income. See id. (justifying the punishment received by an
alcoholic for public drunkenness).
  175. Statistics cited in Part I of this Note show that between 700 and 1,800
homeless people live on the street in Washington, D.C. See supra text accompanying
note 17.
  176. See JOINT COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

fails to deter or rehabilitate him from violating the ordinance again
because the punishment does not relieve the cause of the violation—
his homelessness. Legislators, in their attempt to sweep the streets of
homeless people, fail to realize the exacerbating effect these
ordinances have on the general causes of homelessness.

                                                     CONCLUSION
  Ordinances that prohibit sleeping and camping in public are
imperfect responses to addressing the presence of homeless people
in public places. Prior to In re Eichorn, social service providers and
legislators primarily adopted and addressed the issue. Judicial
responsibility was limited to construction and constitutional
application of the ordinance. After Eichorn, courts will have to make
room for individual trials on the justification for each homeless
person’s violation of an ordinance. If courts begin hearing a large
number of cases that contest anti-camping citations using the
necessity defense, the utility of these ordinances will be limited.
Furthermore, the In re Eichorn court’s recognition of the lack of
shelter space and other resources that assist homeless and other low-
income people may create more support for social service programs
and assist other localities in opposing the use of the ordinances.
Localities must begin to consider alternatives to such ordinances
before burdening the judicial system.

Dear City Council and Planning Commission,

I understand there has been an attempt to end the Downtown Development Cap, a 32-year old law limiting new
hotels, offices, and other nonresidential growth downtown.


Now, more than ever, this cap needs to stay in place. Growth is expected and understood, but our city has grown in
an incredibly irresponsible way. I could list 100 reasons why this is destructive to our community and the
environment, but most of you already know all of these reasons so I’ll just leave it at that.

Subject:                       Partnership Between Palo Alto and Pets In Need




       Dear Mayor and City Council:

       We are writing to urge you to save our shelter at your August 13th meeting by formalizing
       the agreement for Pets In Need to provide animal care services for the City of Palo Alto.

       When the city released an audit of its animal care operation in 2015, we learned that the
       shelter faced challenges that were unlikely to be resolved if it continued operating as a city-
       managed function without a significant increase in general fund subsidy, and/or revenue
       generating contracts.

       The audit also showed that having local animal services is important to Palo Alto, Los Altos
       and Los Altos Hills residents, and that the majority of people are excited by the prospect of
       a public-private partnership to minimize the burden on taxpayers.

       The proposed partnership is projected to save Palo Alto an estimated $200,000 in annual
       operating costs and ensures residents have access to humane animal services locally. The
       partnership would also be a national model for the humane treatment of animals in public
       shelters and would advance the no-kill movement.

       At Pets In Need, no animal is euthanized unless it is determined by the staff veterinarian to
       be dangerous to people or animals or medically irredeemable. According to a recent report
       that tracks the average length of time animals remain in the organization’s care, the vast
       majority spend three weeks or less in the shelter before being placed in a home.

       The decision to have Pets In Need provide animal care services should be a no-brainer for
       the city.

       With contributions from the city and community, Pets In Need has agreed to oversee a
       campaign for a new shelter, which would ensure that residents have humane, state-of-the-
       art local animal services well into the future.

       We are disappointed that after three years of negotiations the city still does not have
       agreement with Pets In Need. If this drags on any longer, we fear the organization will be
       forced to go in a different direction.

       It is time to make the partnership between Palo Alto and Pets In Need official.

       We respectfully request that you get this over the finish line on Aug. 13.

       Save our shelter!

       Sincerely,

       Friends of the Palo Alto Animal Shelter
       Jeremy Lindston Robinson, President

I am unable to attend the meeting. This email shall serve as my opposition to raising the downtown
cap. Let the election, and the citizens voice govern.
Regards,
Kathleen Jason-Moreau

It would appear that the development cabal on the PTC and Council is concerned that the citizens' initiative to
restrain office growth will pass. So the Planning Commission has scheduled Wed. July 25 a discussion of an
Ordinance to raise the Downtown Cap to preempt the election and the expression of the citizens' voice.

Dear Members of the Palo Alto Fire Department, Office of Emergency Services, City Council, Mr. Keene, and
Ms. Stump,


I am bringing forth information attached to this email today in accordance with my duties as a mandated
reporter pursuant of California Welfare and Divisions Code Article 3: Mandatory and Nonmandatory Reports of
Abuse. If I were not to have come forward with the information provided today, I could be tried, convicted, and
face charges for aiding and abetting pursuant of California Penal Code 31, or Conspiracy pursuant of California
Penal Code 182. I have reason to believe, and ask for further opinion, investigation and/or assistance in
addressing this matter, due to the testimonies of others and both my ride- alongs and employment with
ProTransport-1, that ProTransport-1 may be involved in willful and persistent violations of California law
including but not limited to, Insurance Fraud (California Penal Code 550), Harassment (California Penal Code
653 and others), and numerous labor laws.



ProTransport-1 purports to serve our community’s most vulnerable populations: ill children, adults, individuals
with disabilities, and seniors with health issues ranging from kidney failure to dementia. The allegations against
ProTransport-1 suggest a deliberate and regular form of intimidation and harassment in efforts to receive far
more than they are owed from patients and guardians who are at their most vulnerable, and at a time they are
likely least equipped to weather these predatory assaults.



ProTransports-1 also seems to employ in high volume, a population who may not be aware of their legal rights,
options, and/or the boundaries of acceptable workplace behavior and practices. The forms of abuse that I begin
to outline on the basis of attached Yelp! and Glassdoor reviews, not yet sharing the abuses I’ve experienced
myself, or others who for whatever reason have not yet come forward, are accentuated by allegations that
ProTransport-1 leadership views and treats patients merely as a means to extract profit (“cash cows” as one
review reports), and their employees as dispensable vehicles to push a shamelessly self- interested agenda while
willfully neglecting employee well-being, interests, and rights.



What I’ve attached are my bear, shorthand notes and I've omitted narrative details, so I encourage you to read
the full Yelp! and Glassdoor reviews for yourself. With the exception of my own Glassdoor piece, which for
suspect reasons is still undergoing administrative review, all of them should still be posted as of July 12, 2018.

ProTransport-1 Yelp! Cotati

Why are these reviews not recommended? Why are we not able contact these individuals?

Janet R. of Santa Rosa 2/9/2012 (“Not Recommended Review”): She writes that a transport time for
10:00am. This time was pushed back to 12:05pm, with the crew arriving at 1:08pm.

Disney M. of Orange 9/20/2012 (“Not Recommended Review”): Writes that the company cuts corners in
the area of proper patient care, fails to train employees properly, delays bills to keep cash looking good.

Jeff W. of Rohnert Park 2/11/2013 (“Not Recommended Review”): Writes that the company is “hard
nosed, cruel, and unforgiving.” They overcharge.

Frank B. of San Francisco 7/25/2013 (“Not Recommended Review”): Writes that the company
repeatedly sends bills even when he has already paid.

Max A. of Concord 9/9/2013 (“Not Recommended Review”): Writes that a family member was referred
to as a “Cash Cow.”

Michael B. of Trenton 9/19/2013 (“Not Recommended Review”): Writes that their insurance company
incorrectly billed them and that they failed to take responsibility for their errors. This process was
dragged on for 20 months, in which ProTransport-1 claimed that the he was not identified by the
insurance provider while using an incorrect ID number for 10 months. Interestingly, his insurance
applied an allowed amount to his deductible at 10 months.

Scott H. of Sacramento 10/29/2013 (“Not Recommended Review”): Writes that ProTransport-1 would
not send copayment to his insurance, so in order to avoid going to collections, he paid out of pocket.
Even after he paid, Collections contacted him demanding payment.

Sharon P. of Gilroy 8/24/2015 (“Not Recommended Review”): Spent countless hours trying to deal with
ProTransport-1 and their billing. Threatened to be sent to collections. Claim that billing is up to the
patient as they don’t bill Medicare. Over 9 months, ProTransport-1 did nothing but continually send
billing statements to his parents demanding payment. 10 days to pay or sent to collections. Mother
suffered                      from dealing with it.

Anony P. of Bellevue 9/28/2015 (“Not Recommended Review”): 9 miles $9000 requiring payment in ten
days.

Meg D. of Mi- Wuk Village 9/28/2016 (“Not Recommended Review”): Medicare did not receive
appropriate paperwork, indicating that the transport was medically necessary. Failed to provide an
“Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage” or “Notice of Exclusion from Medicare Benefits Form.”
These forms are to be provided by the ambulance company when Medicare may not pay for particular
ambulance service and what charges they may be responsible to pay (for non-medically necessary
transports). Threatened to send them to collections.

steps, Stat of CA Attorney General, and Medicare Fraud line.

Dietra S. of Castro Valley 8/20/2015 (2 voted for the review): Writes of mishandling billings with

Pavel K. of Sunnyvale 9/12/2015 (17 voted for this review): $9150 for a 9 mile trip. Insurance pays 6k
and they pay 3k. “Considering that interfacility transport is mandatory by ambulance, we had absolutely
no choice over which ambulance Stanford ER would contract for us.”

Amanda S. of Rocklin 1/12/2018 (3 voted for this review): 10 miles over $5000. Insurance paid in full.

K J. of Belmont 9/18/2017 (“Not Recommended Review”): Bait and switch for pricing.

Shelley G. of Santa Clara 11/3/2013 (15 voted for this review): Nine- mile trip from hospital to hospital.

ambulance at the advice of the doctor without any knowledge up front of costs.

Dana A. of Boulder Creek 8/25/2015 (4 voted for this review): Company used Stanford Hospital, dead
relative, mailed copy of death certificate, dead person sent to collections and billed every month for 7-8
months.

Chris C. of El Sobrante 10/13/2017 (4 voted for this review): Even though you make monthly payments
on what you owe after insurance, they will send you to collections without notifying you.

Victor C. of San Mateo 9/2/2017 (10 voted for this review): ProTransport takes advantage of the fact
that insurance companies reimburse ambulance transportation not based on what’s actually billed, but
on ‘customary and reasonable costs’ for a similar service in a given area. $3000 for a 20 minute ride in
between 2 Stanford Children’s Hospitals. 33% over market price. Insurance picks up 2k, he picks up 1k.
They have a deal with Kaiser offering their clients a discount to entice Kaiser facilities to use
ProTransport. Sent to collection agency before the deadline passed while trying to negotiate.

M N. of Cupertino 6/18/2018 (1 voted for this review): They wanted to collect money twice. After
paying, they got a call from collections saying they did not receive any money.

Ryan D. of San Jose 5/21/2018 (1 voted for this review): Santa Clara Regional to Good Samaritan in SJ.
6.3 miles at $2723.26. My insurance company deemed that they eligible amount was $1887. The
insurance company paid them 80% of the eligible amount ($1,887, not $2723.26). ProTransport sends
bill of $1213.66 for what they claimed to be remaining amount after insurance. Under fair market policy
Should only be responsible for the 20% of the eligible amount deemed by my insurance, which is $377.4
(NOT $1,213.66).
Pros:

Unlike me, you'll be able to take seriously the information I list below when considering employment
with ProTransport-1. As a current employee, the information below may also be helpful.

Cons:

I have a few recommendations for those employed and considering employment with the company.
First, locate the rating tab and read what others have already written about the company on Glassdoor.
Second, closely read ProTransport-1 Cotati and Palo Alto location reviews on Yelp! Third, pay careful
attention to a few noteworthy experiences here on Glassdoor:

A September 6, 2017, two- star review entitled “Just Don’t,” states that there is rampant, ignored, and
encouraged sexual harassment. A February 15, 2016, one- star review entitled “Minimum wage job with
plenty liability,” states that staffing issues have subjected workers to unsafe situations. A December 18,
2015, one-star review entitled “Disgusting owners and management,” states that they couldn’t work for
a company that was unethical and doesn’t care about legalities. A September 11, 2015, one- star review
entitled “Are they trying to get people to quit?”, states that ProTransport-1 refuses to provide up-to-
date equipment which is hazardous for employees. An October 12, 2014, one- star review entitled “No
Job security,” states that ProTransport-1 fires people for talking about unions. A June 26, 2018, two- star
review entitled “Avoid this Company Unless You’re a Union Employee,” states that ProTransport-1 will
lower your hourly rate and pay less overtime when you work more than eight hours. A June 16, 2016,
two- star review entitled “Money-driven company; no respect for employees,” states that ProTransport-
1 overworks the staff, does not respect worker’s schedules, does not honor vacation time, and requires
overtime for every shift. A January 25, 2016, four-star review entitled “Just starting out,” states that
there is gossip circulating among workers that management goes after individuals. A July 19, 2015
review entitled “Welcome to the EMS stepping stone!,” states that payroll has calculated pay stubs
inaccurately.

I am of the opinion, that alarm bells should be ringing for both current employees and prospective
employees. I don’t know if the claims posted here on Glassdoor or Yelp! are true. I don’t claim to have
experienced these things with this group personally. Depending on the legitimacy of the stories and
evidence of some anecdotes posted above, on Yelp!, and on those who may have not yet come forward
on the named platforms, however, there may be grounds for legal action and compensation, federal
investigation (ie check out the FBI website), and/or a story in a major newspaper(s).

Is this sort of thing you want to possibly endure and/or be associated with? There are other companies,
and there may be better and more satisfying routes to achieve your career goals. If you are currently
employed, you can probably leave. If you are considering employment with this company, you can
probably consider other options. Current employees need to be informed about the potential
consequences of allegations like the ones above and their potential options. Prospective employees
need to be warned as to what they may be getting themselves into.

In re JAMES WARNER EICHORN on Habeas Corpus.

(Municipal Court of Orange County, No. 93CM02515, James M. Brooks, Judge.)

(Opinion by Crosby, J., with Sills, P. J., and Wallin, J., concurring.)

COUNSEL

O'Melveny & Myers, Phillip R. Kaplan, Brett J. Williamson, Todd A. Green and Robert G.
Loewy for Petitioner.

Michael R. Capizzi, District Attorney, and Scott G. Scoville, Deputy District Attorney, for
Respondent.

OPINION

CROSBY, J.-

James Warner Eichorn was convicted of a misdemeanor violation of a City of Santa Ana
ordinance banning sleeping in designated public areas. The appellate department affirmed
his conviction and denied his request to transfer the cause. Eichorn thereafter petitioned for
writ of habeas corpus in this court. We conclude his conviction must be set aside.

I

James Eichorn was cited for violation of the city's anticamping ordinance (Santa Ana Mun.
Code, ch. 10, art. VIII, § 10-402) on the evening of [69 Cal. App. 4th 385] January 25,
1993. fn. 1 Following a detour to the Supreme Court that established the ordinance was
facially constitutional (Tobe v. City of Santa Ana (1995) 9 Cal. 4th 1069 [40 Cal. Rptr. 2d
402, 892 P.2d 1145]), Eichorn's case eventually went to trial.

In a significant pretrial ruling, the court (Judge James M. Brooks) determined Eichorn could
not present a necessity defense (see CALJIC No. 4.43) to a jury. Eichorn had offered to
prove that on the night of the violation every shelter bed within the city that was available to
a homeless single man with no children was occupied, and that he was involuntarily
homeless, i.e., he had done everything he could to alleviate his condition. Due to
circumstances beyond his control, defendant, a 14-year resident of Santa Ana, had been
unable to find work as a manual laborer that paid enough to allow him to find an alternative
place to sleep.
                                                     2
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/24/2018 7:51 AM
The court determined defendant had not made a sufficient showing to allow a jury to
consider his necessity defense: "It appears that the defense of necessity is not supported by
the offer of proof. The first element wasn't satisfied, in the court's view, no significant,
imminent evil for this defendant or any other person." fn. 2 Defendant objected that the
court's ruling "not only goes against what we understand to have been the statements and
admissions by the People and by [Judge Margines, who had previously handled the case] but
undermines the whole reason why we were going forward at trial ... it's clearly eviscerated
our entire defense."

In light of Judge Brooks's ruling on the necessity defense, and noting there was no dispute
Eichorn was in a sleeping bag in the civic center on the night in question, Eichorn's lawyer
agreed to go forward without a jury on the constitutional issue whether the ordinance was
unconstitutional as applied to him based on his alleged involuntary homelessness.

Trial commenced without a jury in May 1996. Officer Carol Craig testified defendant was in
a sleeping bag on the ground about 10:30 p.m. outside a county office building in the civic
center. He was using his clothes as a pillow. Craig asked (as she always did) why Eichorn
wasn't at the National Guard Armory (a homeless shelter several miles away). A bus from
the civic [69 Cal. App. 4th 386] center to the armory usually picked up people between 5:00
and 6:00 p.m. According to Craig's police report, defendant replied he had tried "a while
back." It was full, so he never returned. The court judicially noticed that the walk between
the civic center and the armory was "through very dangerous areas of town." Police
photographed and cited Eichorn, then asked him to move on. He complied.

James Meeker, a professor at the University of California, Irvine in the department of
criminology, law and society, testified he had conducted a study on homelessness in January
and February 1993. There were more than 3,000 homeless individuals in Orange County
during this period. Most homeless were longtime residents of Orange County (average 14
years) who had lost jobs and could not afford housing. The county had relatively little
affordable housing, and it had been decreasing. Single men had a particularly difficult time
because they were less likely to receive the support from family, friends, or governmental
agencies. Most were sleeping outdoors because they had no other choice. Homeless
individuals were 10 times as likely to be victimized by crime than the average population.
Many home less stayed in urban areas because of proximity to assistance providers (food,
clothing and shelter), day jobs (just 8 percent were unemployed and not looking for jobs),
public facilities (restrooms, etc.) and the lack of transportation.

Timothy Shaw was the executive director of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task
Force. He pegged the number of homeless in Santa Ana at about 1,500 persons in 1993.
                                                     3
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/24/2018 7:51 AM
There were about 118 shelter beds available for single men like Eichorn, most available on a
first-come, first-served basis. In addition, the armory could accomodate 125 persons during
the winter (although it frequently exceeded its capacity). As was routine, these shelters were
full on the night Eichorn was cited.

Maria Mendoza was the county's homeless coordinator and oversaw use of the armory as a
shelter. The armory was available only on cold winter nights. She explained how the bus to
the armory would leave from the civic center in the late afternoon. Those on the bus had
priority at the armory. Eichorn had spent some 20 nights there in December and January. On
January 25, the armory was 13 persons over capacity, which was not uncommon. That the
armory would accept excess capacity was not a given. Usually, only those "at risk" (e.g.,
women and children) would be admitted after the maximum was reached, and generally only
when it was raining.

Eichorn, 49 years old, testified he had moved to Costa Mesa in 1972, a few years after his
discharge from the Marine Corps. The Vietnam veteran [69 Cal. App. 4th 387] lost his job
in a machine shop in 1980, and subsequently ended up without a place to live. He moved to
Santa Ana because a friend told him about a job driving an ice cream truck. He sold ice
cream for about a year and was able to afford a motel room. When he lost that job, he
frequented the casual labor office in Santa Ana until it closed. When he worked and could
save enough, he would live in a motel. He also relied on general relief and food stamps.
However, general relief was no longer enough to secure affordable housing because most of
the less expensive motels had been torn down. If he could not get into a shelter, Eichorn
would sleep in the civic center, where he was close to services (including restrooms) and
where there was "safety in numbers" (i.e., where it was less likely someone would steal or
attack him while he slept). He loved to work and did so every chance he got. He did not like
living outside. He had been turned away from the armory in the past and had a "nervous
walk" back to the civic center. On January 25, he did not recall whether he had tried to find a
spot at a shelter or whether he heard that the shelters were full. He recalled eating around
7:00 p.m. He was in his sleeping bag listening to his radio when Craig arrived around 10:30
p.m. Eichorn's mother and stepfather lived in Long Beach, but staying with them was not an
option because he was "an adult responsible for" himself. Defendant denied a problem with
alcohol or drugs.

June Marcott, program manager for food stamps and general relief of the County of Orange,
testified Eichorn received food stamps on a regular basis from 1989 through 1993, except
when he was employed in parts of 1991 and 1992. He was eligible for $307 monthly in

and was terminated because he did not submit a job search report. He applied for relief in
March and June 1992, but was denied.

The court found Eichorn had violated the camping ordinance and was not involuntarily
homeless on the night in question, finding he chose not to go to the armory. He also
suggested defendant should have sought out familial assistance and should have applied for
general relief. The court ordered him to perform 40 hours of community service. By a two-
to-one margin, the appellate department of the superior court affirmed the conviction
without opinion and declined to certify the case to this court for direct review. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 63.) [1] (See fn. 3.) Eichorn filed this petition for habeas corpus and seeks to set
aside his conviction. fn. 3 [69 Cal. App. 4th 388]

II

[2a] Eichorn makes a multipronged attack on his conviction. One of his contentions is that
he was induced to waive his right to a jury trial by the court's pretrial ruling that he could not
present a necessity defense. As noted above, the court ruled the defense's offer of proof was
inadequate, i.e., defendant had not presented enough evidence to get to a jury on the issue of
whether he violated the law to prevent a significant evil. This ruling was error, and we
vacate the judgment accordingly.

[3a] California appellate courts have recognized the necessity defense "despite the absence
of any statutory articulation of this defense and rulings from the California Supreme Court
that the common law is not a part of the criminal law in California." (People v. Garziano
(1991) 230 Cal. App. 3d 241, 242 [281 Cal. Rptr. 307].)

[2b] In Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, supra, 9 Cal.4th at page 1088, the Supreme Court, while
holding the camping ordinance was facially valid, declined to decide whether and how it
might be unconstitutionally applied. The court refused to assume that the ordinance would
be enforced "against persons who have no alternative to 'camping' or placing 'camp
paraphernalia' on public property." (Id. at p. 1088, fn. 8.) Indeed, the Tobe court was given
assurances by the People "that a necessity defense might be available to 'truly homeless'
persons and that prosecutorial discretion would be exercised." (Ibid.)

As the prosecutor recognized at one of the hearings held before trial, "because [defendant
has] that necessity defense at trial, [the law] is never applied unconstitutionally. Because of
the nature of that defense that we're incorporating into our definition, there will never be an
unconstitutional application." The court (Judge Margines) reasoned similarly: "I think ... [69
Cal. App. 4th 389] the statute will not be applied unconstitutionally to these people;

                                                     5
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/24/2018 7:51 AM
because if they are truly in the class that [defense counsel says] renders the application
unconstitutional, then they will be found not guilty by virtue of the necessity defense. [The
defense has] the burden of demonstrating that they fall within the class. It's the same burden
you have at trial if you present a necessity defense."

[4] An instruction on the defense of necessity is required where there is evidence "sufficient
to establish that defendant violated the law (1) to prevent a significant evil, (2) with no
adequate alternative, (3) without creating a greater danger than the one avoided, (4) with a
good faith belief in the necessity, (5) with such belief being objectively reasonable, and (6)
under circumstances in which he did not substantially contribute to the emergency.
[Citations.]" (People v. Pepper (1996) 41 Cal. App. 4th 1029, 1035 [48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 877];
People v. Pena (1983) 149 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 14 [197 Cal. Rptr. 264].)

[3b] The defense of necessity is "founded upon public policy and provides a justification
distinct from the elements required to prove the crime. [Citation.] The situation presented to
the defendant must be of an emergency nature, threatening physical harm, and lacking an
alternative, legal course of action. [Citation.] The defense involves a determination that the
harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater than that sought to be prevented
by the law defining the offense charged. [Citation.] Necessity does not negate any element
of the crime, but represents a public policy decision not to punish such an individual despite
proof of the crime. [Citations.] [¶] An important factor of the necessity defense involves the
balancing of the harm to be avoided as opposed to the costs of the criminal conduct.
[Citation.] Unlike duress, the threatened harm is in the immediate future, which
contemplates the defendant having time to balance alternative courses of conduct. [Citation.]
The defendant has the time, however limited, to form the general intent required for the
crime, although under some outside pressure. [Citation.] Thus, the defense does not negate
the intent element, and the defendant has the burden of proving the defense by a
preponderance of the evidence." (People v. Heath (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 892, 901 [255
Cal. Rptr. 120].) Whether necessity exists is generally a question of fact. (See People v.
Lovercamp (1974) 43 Cal. App. 3d 823, 832 [118 Cal. Rptr. 110, 69 A.L.R.3d 668].)

[2c] At a minimum, reasonable minds could differ whether defendant acted to prevent a
"significant evil." Sleep is a physiological need, not an option for humans. It is common
knowledge that loss of sleep produces a host of physical and mental problems (mood
irritability, energy drain and [69 Cal. App. 4th 390] low motivation, slow reaction time,
inability to concentrate and process information). Certainly, no one would suggest that a
groggy truck driver who stops his rig on the side of a road rather than risk falling asleep at
the wheel does not act to prevent a significant evil, i.e., harm to himself and others. Indeed,
Judge Margines had denied Eichorn's request for funds to hire an expert to testify about the
                                                     6
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/24/2018 7:51 AM
harmful effects of sleep loss: "I mean it doesn't take an expert to tell us that, to convince a
person, that there are ill effects that arise from sleep [deprivation]."

The court must instruct if the evidence could result in a finding defendant's criminal act was
justified by necessity. (People v. Slack (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 937, 941 [258 Cal. Rptr.
702].) Eichorn's offer of proof was sufficient. There was substantial if not uncontradicted
evidence that defendant slept in the civic center because his alternatives were inadequate fn.
4 and economic forces were primarily to blame for his predicament.[5] (See fn. 5.), [2d]
Thus, whether denominated a denial of his right to jury trial fn. 5 or of his due process right
to present a defense (see People v. Schroeder (1991) 227 Cal. App. 3d 784, 787 [278 Cal.
Rptr. 237] [noting the "right of a [69 Cal. App. 4th 391] criminal defendant to present a
defense and witnesses on his or her behalf is a fundamental element of due process
guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"]), the court's
error was clear, fundamental, and struck at the heart of the trial process.

Finally, because Eichorn is entitled to raise a necessity defense to charges he violated the
camping ordinance, we find no other constitutional violations under the circumstances of
this case. (See Robinson v. California (1962) 370 U.S. 660 [82 S. Ct. 1417, 8 L. Ed. 2d 758]
[state law making status of narcotic addiction a criminal offense inflicted cruel and unusual
punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment].)

The writ is granted and the cause remanded to the former municipal court with directions to
set aside the judgment of conviction and to proceed in conformity with this opinion.

Sills, P. J., and Wallin, J., concurred.

FN 1. Section 10-402 reads as follows: "Unlawful Camping. [¶] It shall be unlawful for any
person to camp, occupy camp facilities or use camp paraphernalia in the following areas,
except as otherwise provided: [¶] (a) Any street; [¶] (b) Any public parking lot or public
area, improved or unimproved." Camp paraphernalia included a sleeping bag.

FN 2. The court's questions and comments suggested it was not impressed with defendant's
claim lack of sleep was a significant evil ("what do you mean 'bodily harm?' Like tired
eyelids or blood?"; "[I]f he didn't sleep here, he'd lose sleep and this would be a horrible
physical thing to impose on him?").

FN 3. The district attorney raises a preliminary procedural bar to the petition because
Eichorn (unsuccessfully) raised the same issues in the appellate department in his direct
appeal. (In re Harris (1993) 5 Cal. 4th 813, 825 [21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 373, 855 P.2d 391] ["
'[h]abeas corpus will not serve as a second appeal' "].) Harris noted "that in the absence of
                                                     7
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/24/2018 7:51 AM
strong justification, any issue that was actually raised and rejected on appeal cannot be
renewed in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus." (Id. at p. 829.)

Eichorn fits within an exception because, as we discuss below, the trial court misapplied the
law and no material facts are in dispute. (See In re Wallace (1970) 3 Cal. 3d 289, 293 [90
Cal. Rptr. 176, 475 P.2d 208] [court entertained habeas corpus petition after denial of
certification where petition involved issues already litigated and it appeared " ' "the statute
under which [the defendant] was convicted did not prohibit his conduct" ' "]; In re Catalano
(1981) 29 Cal. 3d 1, 7, fn. 7 [171 Cal. Rptr. 667, 623 P.2d 228] [even untimely request for
decertification does not bar relief].) There is no meaningful dispute about the underlying
facts; only their legal significance is at issue. We also agree with Eichorn that his petition
raises several issues that implicate clear and fundamental rights bearing on the issue of his
guilt. (In re Harris, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 830 [" ' "If the violation of a petitioner's
constitutional rights ... had any bearing on the issue of his guilt, there should be no doubt
that habeas corpus would be available." ' "].)

FN 4. In connection with its pretrial ruling that defendant could not present a necessity
defense, the court suggested defendant had adequate alternatives to sleeping in a public
place in Santa Ana ("The court is aware, firsthand [that] other buildings, nearby churches
[etc.] ... have rear stairs, rear doors .... ; Couldn't your client have found a nice little warm,
covered stairwell, on private property, to sleep?"; "[H]ow about [other] private property,
backyards, trees, under a tree in a condemned home?"; "[I]s [it] a reasonable alternative ...
walking a mile or so [to a nearby city without a camping ordinance?] Stroll on a nice sunny
day, find a cushy spot in Tustin, in a city park and make his home there.") For guidance of
the court at any retrial, neither trespassing on private property nor walking to a different city
was an adequate alternative. Simply put, Santa Ana may not "solve" its social problems by
foisting them onto nearby localities; an individual who has no reasonable alternative to
sleeping in a public place in Santa Ana need not travel in search of streets and other public
places where he can catch his 40 winks.

FN 5. Of course, the right to trial by jury embodied in the California Constitution extends to
so-called "petty" as well as to "serious" criminal offenses, i.e., to misdemeanors as well as
felonies. (Mitchell v. Superior Court (1989) 49 Cal. 3d 1230, 1242 [265 Cal. Rptr. 144, 783
P.2d 731].) Defendant cites People v. Sandoval (1987) 188 Cal. App. 3d 1428, 1435 [234
Cal. Rptr. 97], where the court addressed a claim that a jury trial waiver was constitutionally
flawed because it was based on the court's evidentiary error. In Sandoval the trial court erred
when it failed to exercise discretion under Evidence Code section 352 concerning
impeaching defendant with prior convictions. As a result of this erroneous pretrial ruling,
defendant waived a jury, believing he could not get a fair trial if the jury learned of his
                                                     8
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/24/2018 7:51 AM
priors. The court observed that "One's choice to forgo a jury trial should not be forced by a
concern that to do so provides the only fundamentally 'fair' trial opportunity. Certainly, there
is no incentive for the People or the court to exercise discretion in evaluating admission of
prior conviction evidence, if a blanket admission policy would ease their procedural burden
by coercing waivers of jury trials constituted so as to deny fundamental constitutional
rights." (188 Cal.App.3d at p. 1434.) However, Sandoval held the error was subject to the
Watson (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal. 2d 818 [299 P.2d 243]) test for reversible error:
"To apply a reversal per se rule in a case where a fully informed defendant waives a jury
trial merely to avoid adverse pretrial evidentiary rulings which later prove erroneous would
permit litigants to abuse the judicial process. Defendants caught red-handed, facing
insurmountable proof, would be encouraged to inundate the courts with in limine evidentiary
motions, hoping to obtain one which is erroneous, regardless of its significance to
establishment of guilt. To require reversal of a fundamentally fair court trial merely because
a defendant couples his jury waiver with a statement that it was to avoid the impact of
evidence later held inadmissible, without regard to its effect on the judgment, does not
promote respect for the judicial system." (188 Cal.App.3d at p. 1436.) To the extent
Sandoval is on point, it is distinguishable in that Eichorn's court trial was not "fundamentally
fair" because he was deprived of his only defense to the charge.

Hi, Sara and Josh. I am following up on my emails from last week. Could you please confirm that the stop
signs will be reinstalled for both westbound and eastbound traffic on Louis at Amarillo? Alternatively, please

 Hi, Sarah and Josh.

 As I drove through the intersection of Amarillo and Louis this afternoon, I was disappointed to see that the
 stop sign at Amarillo for eastbound traffic on Louis has been removed.

 For the reasons I outlined in my email this morning, I ask that the City please replace the stop sign
 immediately for the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists.

        First, the approved plans for the intersection show a stop sign for eastbound traffic on Louis at Amarillo,
          as I've highlighted on the attached plan sheet. That is what the public expected when the project was
          approved, and the City should keep its word.
        Second, if eastbound traffic on Louis does not stop at Amarillo, then it will be harder for bikes and cars
          to turn left onto Louis, particularly during the busy morning and evening peak hours. The numerous
          changes that the City has made to the intersection will already pose a challenge for parents who drive
          their kids to Ohlone Elementary in the morning (which unlike most other elementary schools in Palo
          Alto draws its students from throughout the district, not just those within walking or biking distance),
          and if it is difficult for cars to turn left from Amarillo onto eastbound Louis, then that intersection will
          be jammed every morning.
        Third, for pedestrians, part-way stop signs are not intuitive. Kids, for example, will reasonably assume
          that since there is a stop sign for westbound traffic at the intersection, then eastbound traffic must have
          a stop sign as well, and they'll risk stepping out into the crosswalk with the assumption that cars are
          about to stop. And as we all know, even though drivers are required to yield to pedestrians in
          crosswalks (marked or unmarked), many drivers don't.
        Fourth, many drivers do not know how to handle intersections like the one that the City has constructed
          at the Louis, Amarillo and Fielding. Sarah told me this morning that this is a combined intersection,
          which means that traffic at the two stop signs at Fielding and Louis is supposed to take turns with the
          traffic at the two stop signs at Amarillo and Louis. But Fielding and Amarillo are separated by more
          than 100 feet, and most drivers will assume that the intersections are separate and that drivers at Louis
          and Fielding do not need to watch or yield to drivers at Louis and Amarillo.

                                                            1
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/20/2018 2:28 PM
While I appreciate the City's effort to make the streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians, the changes to the
intersection of Louis and Amarillo will only make it worse. Again, I ask that the City please replace the stop
sign for eastbound traffic on Louis at Amarillo.

Thanks.

 Hi, Sarah and Josh. I wanted to follow up on the quick conversation I had with Sarah this morning regarding
 the changes to the intersection of Amarillo and Louis. As I explained to Sarah, Granite has posted a "Cross
 Traffic Does Not Stop" sign for traffic entering the intersection southbound on Amarillo. However, the
 approved plans for the project (see, e.g., sheet CD-3) show that stop signs will continue to be in place for both
 eastbound and westbound traffic on Louis as traffic crosses Amarillo, which means that the "Cross Traffic"
 sign should not be necessary.

 It is essential for bike and vehicle safety that both eastbound and westbound traffic on Louis stop immediately
 before crossing Amarillo. The distance between the Fielding and Amarillo is too far for traffic turning left
 from southbound Amarillo onto eastbound Louis to be able to see whether traffic is approaching eastbound on
 Louis, particularly for bicyclists. Similarly, if the stop sign at Amarillo for eastbound traffic on Louis is
 eliminated, eastbound traffic on Louis that is stopped at Fielding will not be able to see southbound traffic on
 Amarillo and will not recognize or respect the right-of-way of the southbound Amarillo traffic. Again, this
 will be particularly dangerous for bicyclists turning left from southbound Amarillo onto eastbound Louis.

 I understand the desire to minimize the number of stop signs along this section of Louis, but the stop sign at
 Amarillo for eastbound traffic on Louis must remain, as shown on the approved plans. If the City would like
 to minimize the number of stop signs in this area, please consider eliminating the new stop sign at Fielding
 which provides minimal benefit, since few cars turn left onto southbound Fielding, and the stop sign provides
 no benefit for pedestrians crossing Louis at Fielding, since there is no traffic control for westbound Louis
 traffic at that location.

 I asked the City to provide copies of plans for the Neighborhood Traffic Safety & Bicycle Boulevard Project
 that are signed by a licensed traffic engineer and a copy of any report or memo from a showing that the plans
 have been reviewed and approved by a licensed traffic engineer, but the response I received from the City
 indicates that the plans were not prepared by or approved by a licensed traffic engineer. I have worked with
 Hexagon Transportation Consultants, one of Alta Planning + Design's subcontractors for the project, on a
 number of occasions and have generally been pleased with their work, but it appears that they might not have
 been sufficiently involved in this project.

 I'm hoping that you can confirm that the stop signs will remain in place for both westbound and eastbound
 traffic on Louis at Amarillo, as shown on the approved plans. If not, please would you schedule a time for the
 three of us and a representative from Hexagon to talk.

 Thanks very much.

Dear Members of the Planning Commission: I was serving on the City Council that passed the Downtown Development
Cap. There were studies and documentation supporting that Development Cap then and their conclusions were valid
then and continue to be valid now. Palo Alto is like the frog in the pot of cold water. The temperature slowly rises and
the frog never jumps out of the pot but eventually overheats and dies. Those of us who have lived in Palo Alto for a
while, are well aware that past predictions of traffic congestion and parking shortages were on the mark. As has been
pointed out by others, downtown development has been receiving a huge parking subsidy in the form of local residential
neighborhood parking that gives downtown employees (and their employers/property owners) valuable city real estate.
The fees paid for that parking simply pay the costs of enforcement ‐ probably not even street maintenance.

With all the hullabaloo about housing shortages, abandoning the Downtown Development Cap is clearly impacting
housing that exists in the downtown. The President Apartments is the current most visible victim, but many smaller
apartments have already fallen victim as well.

The whole concept of Comprehensive Plannning is to make sure that ALL of the Planning Elements are in balance with
each other and that the City’s Land Use and Transportation actually function efficiently. Palo Alto has been reaching
toward a point of no return for some time, but you, the Planners, need to affirmatively take charge to make a difference.

Please retain and enforce the Downtown Development Cap.

Sincerely,

Emily M. Renzel

Dear City Council

Regarding changes to the Downtown Office Cap, please(!)

Take no action until all residents in the Downtown RPP are fully notified and informed about parking impact
including the unkonwn funding of the programs to manage the RPP. Staffing and budgets to manage permit
parking are on the shakiest grounds in the past two years.

Take no action until neighborhood traffic solutions are fully discussed with neighbors currently challenging
safety and traffic issues on Middlefield, Hamilton, Lincoln and Addison.

Subject:                         Selective law enforcement and harrasment



Dear Chief Jonsen,

I'm a rv dweller in palo alto. I have        and am getting treated at Stanford hospital. I used to be a software
engineer and have lived in Palo Alto over 40 years. I'm not mentally ill or an alcoholic or a druggy. I now work
a minimum wage job. I'm old, 74 years old.

Here's my complaint. I park my rv in the area around portage, lambert, and ash.
Monday I was parked on ash and got a ticket rather than a tow notice. There are numerous vehicles parked on
lambert illegally and they don't get ticketed but when I park on lambert I get a ticket. After I got the ticket on
ash on Monday I moved to a legal parking place on portage. Today when I got off work I find a tow notice on
my rv. I haven't even been there 1 day. In the same block of portage there are 2 trailers and one rv that have
been parked there for over a month. They don't get either tickets or tow notices. There are many other rv's
parked in palo alto that don't get tickets.

This is very selective enforcement and it seems like harrasment.

I really can't leave the area as I'm getting treated for my           I work at my minimum wage job, save
money so i can hopefully someday get some low income housing but getting tickets slows down the process as
does being singled out for two notices. I need to stay in the area to live. Stanford medicine gives me a chance
against my

There is law and there is justice.

I harm no one, I'm the victim.

Best,

Fred Smith

Subject:                         Stop Hotel President Conversion



Dear Palo Alto City Council:

I live at the Hotel President at 488 University and I am a registered voter.

I strongly urge the council to look very carefully at the proposed conversion of the Hotel President from
housing for dozens of Palo Alto citizens to a high-end hotel that will primarily benefit out-of-town folks.

This sale and proposed conversion deserve more scrutiny and consideration for its potential impact upon Palo
Alto citizens.

If there is anything amiss with the conversion, please strike it down or demand that AJ Capital (current owners
of Hotel President) enter into a good-faith mediation session with the residents.

As you are well aware, it is difficult to find affordable housing in Palo Alto for those of us that have moderate
incomes. All of us at the Hotel President work and live here in the community and would like to continue to do
so. Many folks have lived her for decades and contributed greatly to the community.

I have personally spent the last month since the sale was announced looking to find replacement housing that
meets my needs and income level. It is difficult and so far I have not successfully found any replacement
housing. It will be a stretch to identify new housing and get moved by the 12 November deadline that AJ
Capital has imposed.

AJ Capital has offered $3000 'moving expenses' and the help of an 'expert' relocation service. This gesture,
although likely well-intentioned, falls short. I have met with the relocation 'expert' and described my needs over
a month ago and have yet to receive any relocation assistance. Additionally, it is not at all clear if the offered
$3000 will truly cover my moving expenses and the expenses associated with setting up a new apartment.

Your focused and sensitive consideration of this situation is much appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Kevin Haney

Thank you Chantal for this comprehensive reply to my questions and concerns.

   Having seen the lines and flags that were established on top of the hill last year, to delineate
to the public what I thought indicated a house to be built on TOP of the hill, I never did understand that the house
was to be built INTO the slope facing the public open space park. Thank you for your clarification of this.

   I was in Egypt at the time of the public hearing and did not get a chance to look at the plans.
My husband spoke at the meeting on my behalf, after I had spoken at a previous council meeting.
He noted that the city allowed the property owner and his team of architects a lot of time to speak and
present their case.

   Honestly, this is most discouraging and disappointing. The project is much more intrusive
to the park than I ever imagined it to be. It definitely impacts the hiking up there, visually.
A lot of people have commented on it who have seen it. A friend of mine has stopped hiking up there
altogether, due to this project. She says it is no longer a happy, natural‐feeling place for her.
She too, spoke at the hearing.

You have satisfied me that the project is proceeding according to plans that the city,
amazingly and disappointingly, has approved.

I wonder if this project truly reflects the spirit of our city’s intentions to preserve open space views.

I wonder if this project serves the interest of the taxpayers and residents of this city.

I wonder what the City Council of the 1960’s would have thought of this, who had the
foresight and stewardship to create, at some cost, Foothills Park for generations to enjoy.

Hello Ms. Atkinson,

The City Manager asked that I provide a response to your email. I’ve spoken with our staff in the Planning and
Community Environment Department and they provided me with the following information related to your inquiry:

While the grading is unsightly at the present, the house has been planned to be tucked into the hillside in order to
reduce its profile relative to the ridgeline. This requires cutting of the hillside during construction, although it is
important to know that the finished grade will largely mirror the existing grade at the end of construction. The design
intent was described in the applicant’s project plans, which included grading plans, section drawings describing the
house in relation to the existing and proposed grade, and earthwork balances. The project plans and design intent were
discussed in two public hearings of the Planning and Transportation Commission (PTC) and City Council, and summarized
in staff reports and staff and applicant presentations for those hearings. Concerns related to the grading were brought
up at the Council hearing during the public comment period and in written correspondence prior to the Council’s
decision on the project. The project was approved by the Council after they made the findings that the project is
consistent with the Site and Design Review objectives and Open Space Review Criteria, which actually encourage cutting
when doing so would help homes blend in with the surrounding environment.

This house is in the beginning stages of construction and it will take a while for the results to show, but the conditions of
approval require at least 90% of the site area to either remain undisturbed or, as is the case of areas currently being
graded, be fully restored with native vegetation. The conditions of approval require the recordation of a restrictive
covenant to ensure the efficacy of this restoration plan will run with the land in perpetuity to ensure compliance in the
long‐term.

We appreciate your involvement in the planning process for this house and desire to protect the Preserve, which we
certainly share.

If you have any questions about this approval let us know. I’ve copied Graham Owen, from our Planning and Community
Environment staff on this email.

Best,
Chantal C. G.

To the Palo Alto City Council and Mayor Liz Kniss,

   Last week you were sent photos of the construction taking place above Arastradero
Open Space Preserve as seen from the trails, expressing concern about the
decision to allow this project, and accompanied by a quote about the importance of
                                                                 2

preserving nature by Lyndon B. Johnson.

 I thought I would not write to you again about this topic.

  Today, July 10, hiking at Arastradero it became even more clear to this writer
the extent to which the hilltop and park‐facing slope are being altered and damaged
by this private construction project that does not benefit the public.

   I ask if the city council, or the city attorney, could please kindly – whenever convenient—
assure me in writing, in email here, that what is taking place on this construction site is legal.

   I ask if you could please kindly tell me in writing that you knew this slope alteration would
take place, when you voted to approve this project.

  In my opinion it was not made clear to the public at council meetings in 2017, nor at
the public hearing about this construction site (in March 2017) that this once‐pristine hill would
be scraped out and denuded the way it was seen today (see photos attached, taken today).

  The public was told that plantings would be installed to screen the 9000+ square foot mansion
being built on top of the hill,
but no mention was made at city meetings, that I recall, of allowing extensive removal or damage
to the hill itself.
Today, it looks destroyed.

  This construction site, I was told by joggers who were up there today, apparently does have
many tree and plant seedlings in place as were promised, to screen the mansion to be installed
at the top.

But these seedlings are not visible from any park trails down below.
What is visible from the park today are only the deep scars being dug in the hillside, as well as the
complete scraped‐out/removal of the north end of the slope, visible from the park. See photos.

Regarding the planted seedlings:
 Trees, and most particularly oak trees, can take a very long time to grow and mature.
 This hill is going to look bad for a very long time. And it may never look natural again.

Ironically, today around 10:45 am at the top of Meadowlark Trail, I heard a buzz‐saw at the site.
It was apparently cutting trees, or some kind of wood, but I did not see what was actually being cut.

   In late fall 2016 / winter 2017 posted lines and flags demarked the proposed construction site at
the top of this hill, alerting the public to the location of the planned mansion.
  Nowhere was any indication made visually of the denuding of the slope to take place, below the house‐site.
  Nowhere was any indication made of a road to be carved into the slope to support construction equipment.
  (see photos)

This significant hillside alteration was not made clear to the public during city council meetings.
This has made the project so much worse than we thought it would be.

It is my understanding that city code prevents new construction that would negatively affect
views from our open space parks.
Would this not include denudation of a highly visible grassy slope facing the park ?

                                                               3
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 7/20/2018 10:02 AM

The construction equipment appears to be driving on a road or pathway newly dug into the slope.

   If possible, I would be grateful for an inspection of the site by a council member, when convenient,
including taking a look at this project as seen from down below the site, on the popular Meadowlark Trail
in our park.
   I would like to know if the damage taking place to this hill today is legal,
and if this is what our city codes intend, and if this is what you—our city council, intended with your vote.

Thank you,
  Kim Atkinson

The cement sculpture at the Baylands was one of the first environmental projects that the City paid for.

       The artist, John Kennedy aka:Boris and his crew dredged and moved the cement blocks strewn
       around the area into a cohesive sculpture. For over 30 (approx) years the cement sculpture has
       been in the same place, providing a quiet moment to view the sunrise or sunset - a place for a
       child to climb and explore, under the watchful eye of an adult, or they might join in. I have
       suggested to many a visitor to go out to the baylands and seek out the sculpture - they come back
       with a smile. There was a poem written and cast in bronze - which was adhered to one block of
       cement. As art in in the eye of the beholder - there is a sense of art (i.e. balance/harmony) to the
       sculpture. All of it just ripped out. Why?

       It didn’t block traffic, increase rents, create a hazard - it just “WAS”and we could visit = take a
       moment, take a deep breath and leave refreshed. Who or what was this sculpture offending or
       hurting?

 Will the world go on, of course. Are there bigger problems in the city or country - absolutely. BUT for an
absurd reason known only to those that ripped it out, you approved the removal of a place that made Palo Alto
special. At one time, a city that gave value to sustainable art, respect and caring for more than Tesla'’s or
property value, development, over development, and removed a very very special place to go to, a place of quiet
renewal.




        Sadly, I think you killed another piece of the Palo Alto spirit

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

The CALIFORNIA SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES TAX ACT OF 2020

SECTION 1. Findings and Declarations

   {a) There is overwhelming evidence of the link between obesity, diabetes,
dental disease and heart disease and the consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSB), such as soft drinks, energy drinks, sweet teas and sports drinks.
Each year thousands of Californians require medical and dental treatment
because of consumption of sweetened beverages.

   (b} According to a 2016 report by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research,
over 2.5 million California adults report having been diagnosed with diabetes,
representing one out of every 12 adult Californians. Combined with an estimated
13 million California adults who have prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes, these
groups make up 55 percent of the state's adult population. The vast majority of
diabetes cases in California are type 2, representing 1.9 million adults.

   (c) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, diabetes Is
the seventh leading cause of death in California and has been determined to be
the underlying cause of death for over 9,000 Californians each year.

    (d} Adults with type 2 diabetes more often have other health problems. One-
half of adults with type 2 diabetes also have hypertension. This rate of occurrence
is twice as high as for those without diabetes. Adults with diabetes are
significantly more likely to have cardiovascular disease, arthritis and kic;lney failure
than adults without diabetes.

    {e} Latino Americans, African Americans, Native Americans and Asian/Pacific -
Islander Americans have higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than non-Hispanic
Whites. Seven percent of non-Hispanic Whites have type 2 diabetes, compared
with 12 percent of Latino Americans, 9 percent of Asian Americans, 14 percent of
Pacific Islander Americans, 13 percent of African Americans and 17.5 percent of
Native American populations. If trends are not reversed, it is predicted that one in
three children and nearly one-half of Latino American and African American
children born in the year 2000 will develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime.
    (f) The prevalence of obesity in the United States has accelerated dramatically
over the past 20 years. In California, 25 percent of adults in California were obese
in 2016 - an increase in obesity prevalence of nearly 40 percent since 2001.
Although no group has escaped the epidemic, those who are low income and
communities of color are disproportionately affected.

   (g) The rate of children who are overweight has also increased dramatically in
recent decades. In 2010, 38 percent of California children in grades 5, 7, and 9
were overweight or obese. Thirty-one of California's 58 counties experienced an
increase in childhood obesity from 2005 to 2010.

    (h) California adults who drink a soda or more per day are 27 percent more
likely to be overweight or obese, regardless of income or ethnicity.

    (i) According to nutritional experts, sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soft
drinks, energy drinks, sweet teas and sports drinks, offer little or no nutritional
value, but massive quantities of added sugars. A 20-ounce bottle of soda contains
the equivalent of approximately 16 teaspoons of sugar. Yet, the American Heart
Association recommends that Americans consume no more than five to nine
teaspoons of sugar per day.

   U) Research shows that almost one-half of the extra calories Americans
consume in their diet comes from sugar-sweetened beverages, with the average
American drinking nearly 50 gallons of sugar-sweetened beverages a year, the
equivalent of 39 pounds of extra sugar every year.

   (k) California Health Interview Survey from 2014 shows that 41 percent of
California children from 2 to 11 years of age, inclusive, and 62 percent of
California teens from 12 to 17 years of age, inclusive, drink soda daily and for
every additional serving of sugar-sweetened beverage that a child consumes per
day, the likelihood of the child becoming obese increases by 60 percent.

    (I} Sugary drinks are a unique contributor to excess caloric consumption. A
large body of research shows that calories from sugary drinks do not satisfy
hunger the way calories from solid food or beverages containing fat or protein do,
such as those containing milk and plant~based proteins. As a result, sugary
beverages tend to add to the calories people consume rather than replace them.

   (m) Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most common chronic childhood disease,
experienced by more than two-thirds of California's children. Left untreated,
decay may cause chronic pain, infection, failure to thrive and delayed growth,
school absenteeism, the inability to concentrate and interference with intellectual
tasks. Dental decay can become severe enough to require emergency room
treatment and when left untreated can lead to death.

   (n) People are susceptible to dental caries throughout their lifetimes. Not only
do adults experience dental caries, but a substantial proportion of that disease is
untreated at any given time. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) results showed that approximately 91 percent of U.S. adults aged 20-
64 had dental caries in permanent teeth in 2011-2012, 27 percent of those adults
aged 2Q-64 had untreated tooth decay in their permanent teeth.

   (o)Tooth loss is an important indicator of oral health and quality of life. It
affects one's ability to chew, speak, socialize and obtain employment.

   (p) The prevalence of permanent tooth loss in 2012 ranged from 13 percent
among 18- to 24-year-old group to 68 percent among adults aged 65 or older in '
California. African American adults in California have a higher prevalence of tooth
loss due to decax or gum disease.

    (q) Children and adults who frequently or excessively consume beverages high
in sugar are at increased risk for dental caries. Sugar-sweetened beverages are
dietary sources of sugar that are factors in caries development and tooth loss.

   (r) The acidity, carbonation and sugars in soft drinks create a high risk of acid
demineralization of dental enamel and makes consumption of these beverages
one of the most significant contributors to tooth decay in children. Sugar-
sweetened beverages, which have minimal nutritional value, are the primary
source of added sugar in the daily diet of children.
   {s) For every additional 25 grams of sugar consumed per person and day, the
cost of dental treatment in the U.S. increases on average by $185 per person per
year.

   (t} Evidence suggests that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages can
significantly affect consumption patterns, thereby having an impact on obesity,
diabetes, dental disease and heart disease rates. A review indicated that for every
10 percent increase in pri·ce, sugar-sweetened beverages consumption decreased
by 7.8 percent.

    (u) It is the intent of the people, by adopting the Children and Family Health
Promotion Trust Fund, to diminish the human and economic costs to California of
diseases related to the overconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. The fund
is intended to create a dedicated revenue source for health, education and
wellness programs designed to prevent and treat obesity, diabetes, dental disease
and heart disease and to reduce the economic and health burden of these costly
health conditions that result from the overconsumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages.

SECTION 2. Statement of Purpose

The purpose of this act is to:

   {a) Diminish the human and economic costs of diseases associated with the
overconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by discouraging their
distribution and consumption in california through a tax on the distribution of
sugar-sweetened beverages, such as high-calorie, low-nutrition products like
soda, energy drinks and syrup or powder used to produce sugar-sweetened
beverages. Certain drinks containing sugar are exempted, including infant formula
and milk products.

   {b)Provide funds to increase funding for existing medical and dental health '
care programs and services that treat diseases that result from the
overconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB-related diseases).

    (c) Provide funds to support activities aimed at prevention of disease related
to the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, improvement of access to and
consumption of healthy and affordable foods and beverages and promotion of
physical activity.

SECTION 3. The CALIFORNIA SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES TAX ACT OF 2020

Part 14.6 (commencing with Section 34100) is added to Division 2 of the

TO: STATE, CITY AND LOCAL OFFICIALS
NOTIFICATION OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY'S REQUEST TO INCREASE
RATES FOR ITS RESIDENTIAL RATE REFORM MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT PROPOSAJ,
(R.12-06-013)
Summary
On July 11, 2018, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed its Residential Rate Reform Memorandum Account
(RRRMA) proposal with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The proposal requests approval to increase
rates for the following activities related to residential rate reform :
• Simplification of rate structure
• Offering new Time-of-Use Rate plan options and conducting a pilot
• Increase minimum bill amounts in order to reduce bill volatility
• Enhanced communications to customers about rate plan changes and options

In order to implement these residential rate reforms required by a CPUC decision, PG&E is requesting $20.5 million to be
collected from customers in rates starting early in 2019 or shortly thereafter depending on the schedule for this proposal.


Background
In 2015, the CPUC launched its residential rate reform efforts to address concerns about customer bill impacts and
volatility caused by the five-tiered rate structure that was put into place after the California Energy Crisis. As part of this
effort, the CPUC directed utilities to implement rate design reforms, including Time-of-Use pilots and studies, marketing,
education and outreach, IT, data analysis and other reasonable costs required to implement the decision. The CPUC also
ordered each utility to create a Residential Rate Reform Memorandum Account to be used for tracking these costs. This
proposal requests recovery of the costs included in the RRRMA in 2015 and 2016.


How will PG&E's proposal affect me?
Most customers receive bundled electric service from PG&E, meaning they receive electric generation, transmission and
distribution services. Based on rates currently in effect, the bill for a typical residential NonCARE customer using 500 kWh
per month would increase from $111.59 to $111. 78, or 0.2 percent. Actual impacts will vary depending on energy usage.


How will PG&E's proposal affect nonbundled customers?
Direct Access and Community Choice Aggregation customers only receive electric transmission and distribution services
from PG&E. The impact of PG&E's proposal on these customers is an average increase of 0.2 percent.

Another category of nonbundled customers is Departing Load. These customers do not receive electric generation,
transmission or distribution services from PG&E. However, these customers are required to pay certain charges by law or
CPUC decision . The impact of PG&E's proposal on these customers is an average increase of 0.07 percent.
