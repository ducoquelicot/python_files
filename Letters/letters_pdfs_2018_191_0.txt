To: City of Palo Alto CAO Committee
From: Debra Figone
                                                                                          1
Date: April 26, 2018

Subject: 2018 CAO Performance Evaluation Process

Purpose

The purpose of this memorandum is to transmit to you materials that will be used during the
CAO Committee meeting scheduled for April 30, 2018, 4:00-5:00pm. Additional materials may
be presented during the meeting.

Attached you will find the following:

1) A “working agenda” for the meeting
2) An abbreviated process overview, including the proposed key elements for each CAO and a
proposed schedule.

The goal reflected in the schedule is to complete the 2018 CAO performance evaluations by
September 10. Compensation decisions and process debrief would follow in October. A modified
evaluation process for the City Manager is assumed, as will be discussed when we meet.

If you have any questions before April 30, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to
once again working with you and the City Council on this year’s process.
