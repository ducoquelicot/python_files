Recommendation
This is an informational item and no City Council action is necessary.

Executive Summary
On September 18th, the Finance Committee unanimously voted to accept the transmission of
the CalPERS Pension Annual Actuarial Valuations as of June 30, 2017 for both the Safety and
Miscellaneous Plans as part of CMR #9604 ‘Accept CalPERS Pension Annual Valuation Reports
as of June 30, 2017 and Review and Confirm Pension Funding and Reporting Policy Guidelines'.
During the discussion regarding the development of a Pension Funding and Reporting Policy,
the Finance Committee asked about the relative rates of return for the City’s Irrevocable
Section 115 Pension Trust Fund with PARS as compared to CalPERs’ rate of return.

That comparison is detailed in the table below with 1 year, 5 year, and 10 year timespans. It is
important to note that the City of Palo Alto chose to invest in the ‘Moderately Conservative’
Index through PARS which is the second most conservative portfolio offered by PARS and
maintains approximately 30 percent of its assets in equities, which can include domestic and
international stocks. As such, compared to CalPERS’ asset mix, it has a different risk profile.

1The Capital Appreciation portfolio has not yet existed for 10 years; this percentage represents
Inception-to-Date performance, or 114 months. Accordingly, it does not have many of the losses that
occurred during the Economic Downturn in 2008.

The PARS portfolio that has the asset mix most like the CalPERS investment portfolio is the
PARS – Capital Appreciation plan. As part of the formulation of a Pension Funding and
Reporting Policy, Staff anticipates reviewing the PARS portfolios and providing further
recommendations to ensure alignment between the City’s long-term strategic goals related to
the pension liability and the PARS portfolio it uses to invest.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the Finance Committee:

    1. Review and discuss the June 30, 2017 CalPERS Annual Valuation reports for the
       Miscellaneous and Safety Pension Plans; and
    2. Review, comment, and confirm further direction to City Staff regarding the
       establishment of a Pension Funding and Reporting Policy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report transmits the annual actuarial valuation reports for the City’s two pension plans
with the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) for review and discussion.
During the 2018 fiscal year, the City Council and Finance Committee spent significant time
understanding and evaluating the City’s pension benefit plans and the financial outlook for
them. As a result, staff is working to develop a Pension Funding and Reporting Policy and is
seeking confirmation from the Finance Committee regarding the terms and outcomes to be
included in that policy.

BACKGROUND
The City of Palo Alto offers its employees and retirees a defined pension benefit plan which is
managed and administered by CalPERS, a State of California Pension Trust Program. Staff
provides the CalPERS Annual Valuation reports, which are actuarial reports detailing the latest
status of the City of Palo Alto pension trust plans for employees and retirees. These reports
calculate the annual required contribution from the City to the pension plans. In addition,
updates on the rate of return, funding status, and changes to the trust based on various
impacts are detailed in each report.


City of Palo Alto                                                                        Page 1
The CalPERS program maintains two pension plans, one for safety employees (sworn fire and
police personnel) and another for miscellaneous employees (all other non-safety personnel
employed by the City, including field personnel, administrative support, and managers). These
Annual Valuation reports provide updated actuarial information for both pension plans as of
June 30, 2017.

There are three tiers of benefits within the two plans described above. Table 1 below details
the current pension plans and the different benefit levels in each tier. It takes City employees
five (5) years of service to vest in any tier of the pension program. Attachment A outlines the
number of employees in each tier by pension plan and employee group as of September, 2018.

* Under the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act (PEPRA), the benefit calculation is limited by a maximum salary of
$145,666 for both the Miscellaneous and Safety plans, therefore it is calculated based on service years but cannot exceed
$145,666. The final salary calculation is based on the average of the highest three years.



DISCUSSION
CalPERS prepares an Annual Valuation report, which is an actuarial analysis to determine the
City’s pension liability and annual required contribution for each of the two pension plans (one
for miscellaneous employees, one for safety employees). These reports provide an update on
the funding status, the results of assumption changes such as rate of return (ROR) which
impacts the discount rate assumption, the new fiscal year Actuarial Determined Contribution
(ADC) and the projected future ADC as a percentage of payroll. The actuarial analysis is based
on current employees’ accrued benefit, former employees who have vested but have not yet
retired, and retired employees as of June 30, 2017. The CalPERS actuarial analysis is completed
two years in arrears by practice.

On December 21, 2016 the CalPERS Board of Administration lowered the discount rate (which is
the anticipated rate of return) from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent over a three-year phase-in


City of Palo Alto                                                                                                     Page 2
beginning in FY 2019. These reports include CalPERS’ accounting for the FY 2017 ROR of 11.2
percent, which is a significant improvement over the prior year’s ROR of 0.61 percent. These
reports do not factor in the preliminary estimate of the FY 2018 ROR of 8.6 percent. Exceeding
the assumed rate of return is a positive short-term result that improved the City’s funding
status, offset by the decrease in the assumed rate of return as CalPERS transitions to the 7.0
percent discount rate. The City’s overall funded status is discussed later in this report and
detailed in Table 5.

CalPERS Projected Contribution Levels

As of 2017, CalPERS has designated two components to the annual billing of the employer
contributions to employee pension accounts. These two components are 1) the Normal Cost
(NC) and 2) the Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL).
   1. The NC reflects the employer contribution for the plan retirement benefits provided to
       current employees based on the current set of assumptions.
   2. The UAL represents the employer amortization of unfunded accrued liability. It is an
       annual payment calculated by CalPERS that will pay down the City’s unfunded accrued
       pension liability over the amortization timeline. If every assumption in the actuarial
       valuation stayed valid through the amortization timeline, the City would eliminate its
       unfunded pension liability after making these annual payments for 30 years. The liability
       grows when assumption goals, such as ROR, are not met.

The ADC for FY 2020 is $30.4 million for the Miscellaneous Plan and $15.2 million for the Safety
Plan. These figures reflect the blended, or combined, cost of both the NC and the UAL and are
within the estimates used during the development of the FY 2019 – FY 2029 Long Range
Financial Forecast.

The tables below summarize the projected percentage of payroll required for each plan to fund
the ADC as well as the individual components that make up this rate. Future ADCs are
estimated to grow from 30.2 percent of payroll in FY 2019 to 42.5 percent of payroll by FY 2025
for Miscellaneous and from 55.6 percent of payroll in FY 2019 to 73.7 percent of payroll by
2025 for Safety. This is based on the phased-in discount rate of a 7.375 ROR for FY 2019, 7.25
percent for FY 2020, and 7.00 percent for future years starting in FY 2021.

    − Table 2 reflects the estimated percentage of payroll that is necessary for the City of Palo
      Alto to fund the employer costs, including both the NC and the UAL. It should be noted
      that most employee labor groups have agreed to “pick-up” percentages of this
      employer contribution rate.
    − Table 3 reflects the projected percentage of payroll for the NC employer contribution.
      This rate increases as the phase-in of the lowered ROR is realized.
    − Table 4 reflects the estimated annual contribution necessary to pay down the UAL. This
      cost also increases as the phase-in of the lowered ROR is realized.

Miscellaneous employees, a 1% employee pick-up of the employer contribution (excluding the Utilities Management
Professional Association of Palo Alto) and for all Safety employees a 3% employee pick-up of the employer contribution.

CalPERS Projected Unfunded Accrued Pension Liability
Included in the Annual Valuation report is a status of both plans’ “funded status”. Overall,
CalPERS has 68.3% of the funding it needs for its obligations. This is higher than the City’s
funded status of 63.5% for Safety and 66.3% for Miscellaneous. Table 5 details the City’s funded
status for the Miscellaneous and Safety plans with an assumed ROR as of 7.375 effective June
30, 2017. The total unfunded pension liability increased from $404.7 million as of June 30, 2016
to $414.9 million as of June 30, 2017. This represents an increase of $10.2 million, or 2.5%. This
much slower growth, reflected in Table 5 below, represents an improvement over prior years.

CalPERS recognizes the impacts that varying assumptions may have on a plan’s unfunded
accrued liability, and thereby the pension plan’s funding status, especially the implications of
the discount rate assumption. Therefore, in addition to the actuarial assumptions used to
develop this Annual Valuation, CalPERS includes an Analysis of Discount Rate Sensitivity section
in their reports to provide some level of sensitivity analysis of the pension plans. This analysis
can be found on page 22 of each respective plan report. Table 6 illustrates CalPERS’ analysis of
the June 30, 2017 UAL’s discount rate sensitivity. For example, at 6.0 percent ROR, the total
UAL would increase to $606.3 million, representing a 57.1% funded status for Miscellaneous
and a 54.6% funded status for Safety. This analysis gives an indication of the potential impacts if
CalPERS were to realize investment returns ranging from 3.0% to 8.0% over the long term. This
type of analysis provides a sense of the potential long-term rise of the employer contribution
rates.

Potential Policy and Financial Impacts of Establishing a Pensions Funding and Reporting Policy
and Amending the General Fund Reserves Policy

Throughout FY 2018, the Finance Committee held several meetings to discuss the pension
obligations for current employees and retirees. During those discussions, the Finance
Committee expressed an interest in developing a pension funding and reporting policy with the
goal of taking steps to safeguard employee retirement benefits by proactively saving for the
future. The City has taken steps to proactively address the UAL and partially mitigate the
potential impact of lower than anticipated CalPERS investment returns. The City took one such
step in 2017 by establishing an irrevocable IRS Section 115 Pension Trust Fund (PARS Pension
Trust). To date, the City has contributed approximately $7.5 million dollars to the trust, of
which $4.6 million is from the General Fund.

Several additional options are available to further address the City’s unfunded pension liability.
Staff is seeking confirmation from the Finance Committee regarding policy options to be
addressed as part of codifying a potential Pension Funding and Reporting Policy. At this stage,
nothing precludes the City from pursuing any of these options, even without formal adoption.
For example, even though there was not a formal policy, the City contributed $2.0 million in
remaining FY 2017 funding that had been budgeted for pensions to the PARS Pension Fund as


City of Palo Alto                                                                                 Page 5
part of the FY 2018 Mid-Year Report. However, feedback from the Finance Committee
confirming the options to pursue would ensure further staff resources on the policy and
financial implications associated with those options are used effectively and efficiently.

Staff recommends following the guidelines listed below in the development of a policy. A brief
explanation of each option, including the work necessary to fully explore the policy and
financial implications, is included after the list. This list is not in order of priority.

Recommended Pension Policy Guidelines:

    1) Provide an alternative scenario for pension liabilities assuming a discount rate of 6.2%
       for reporting in the City’s annual financial reports, however, maintain formal reporting
       using the CalPERS provided rates.
    2) Analyze the annual CalPERS actuarial valuations and evaluate opportunities to more
       efficiently amortize the City’s UAL compared to the default minimum contribution
       schedules proposed by CalPERS.
    3) Amend the City Council’s General Fund Reserves Policy.
    4) Transmit budgetary savings in employer contributions as an Additional Discretionary
       Payment (ADP) to either CalPERS or PARS.
    5) Establish funding level guidelines for the PARS Section 115 Pension Trust.


Descriptions of Pension Policy Guidelines:

    1) Provide an alternative scenario for pension liabilities assuming a discount rate of 6.2%
       for reporting in the City’s annual financial reports, however, maintain formal reporting
       using the CalPERS provided rates.

         In November, 2016 CalPERS outside actuarial consultant, Wilshire Associates, stated
         that its estimated rate of return for CalPERS for the next ten years was 6.2 percent. The
         City can continue to work to model the impacts of a 6.2 percent discount rate compared
         to the 7.0 percent discount rate modeled by CalPERS consistent with last year. This
         alternative costing can be used to help inform financial planning and prioritization such
         as presenting it as an alternative scenario of the annual Long Range Financial Forecast.

         The City can continue reporting alternative scenarios in its annual financial documents
         such as the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) and the annual budget,
         providing context for its continued financial prudency and the potential liabilities it
         faces. While it is important to ensure the City addresses its unfunded pension liability, it
         is also important to remain consistent with the financial community and the reporting
         requirements of the financial community’s governing bodies. Staff recommends that
         formal financial reporting remain consistent with the CalPERS assumptions and costs



City of Palo Alto                                                                              Page 6
         outlined in the annual actuarial valuation. This would be relatively minimal additional
         work if the City chooses to continue its alternative discount rate calculations.

    2) Analyze the annual CalPERS actuarial valuations and evaluate opportunities to more
       efficiently amortize the City’s UAL compared to the default minimum contribution
       schedules proposed by CalPERS.

         As discussed earlier in this report, CalPERS provides an annual ADC calculation to the
         City of Palo Alto for both the Miscellaneous and Safety plans. This ADC provides
         sufficient funding for both the ‘pay-as-you-go’ portion (Normal Cost) as well as the cost
         for a single year’s payment of the UAL amortized over a 30 year base. However, there
         may be opportunities to proactively fund the City’s pension costs through Additional
         Discretionary Payments (ADPs).

         There are tradeoffs associated with transmitting payments directly to CalPERS or
         remitting ADPs to the PARS Pension Trust. To make a comprehensive recommendation
         regarding ADPs, staff would commit to evaluate the potential financial implications of
         making an ADP to CalPERS or the PARS Pension Trust. For example, this review may
         look at amortization schedules (pay off schedule) at varying lengths, 15 years, 20 years,
         and 30 years and the potential savings over the long term that the City may achieve.
         However, this analysis would also put in context of the implications on the annual
         budget and the potential constraints or benefits alternative amortization periods would
         provide.

    3) Amend the City Council’s General Fund Reserves Policy.

         The Budget Stabilization Reserve (BSR) policy within the General Fund Reserves Policy
         could be amended to provide more options to proactively address the City’s pension
         liability. The policy currently states that any BSR balance above 18.5 percent may be
         transferred to the Infrastructure Reserve (IR) at the discretion of the City Manager. This
         language could be amended to split BSR balance above 18.5 percent between the
         Infrastructure Reserve and addressing the City’s pension obligations. Since the City pays
         its pension ADC in full on an annual basis, this additional funding would constitute an
         ADP that could be either to the PARS Pension Trust or a direct payment to CalPERS. This
         would allow greater flexibility when the BSR exceeds the targeted level of 18.5 percent.
         Alternatively, the City Council could also choose to lower the target for the BSR from
         18.5 percent which could make more funding available for things like pension pre-
         funding. This would not require significant additional staff work to achieve. This may
         impact the City’s funding for the Infrastructure Reserve as the General Fund provided
         $36.9 million to the Infrastructure fund between 2012 and 2016.




City of Palo Alto                                                                            Page 7
    4) Transmit budgetary savings in employer contributions as an Additional Discretionary
       Payment (ADP) to either CalPERS or PARS.

         Annually, the City’s budget plans for employer pension contributions at authorized
         staffing levels for both the normal cost and the annual UAL. Because of fluctuations in
         actual City employee pension demographics and vacancies throughout the organization,
         there may be years where the City experiences savings in budgeted pension costs
         compared to actual pension costs. Another option is to annually transmit any unspent
         funds at year-end as an ADP. The City performed this action as part of the Mid-Year
         2018 Report, when it transmitted $2.0 million (all funds) in remaining funding from FY
         2017 to PARS. The continued transmittal of any remaining funds intended for pension as
         an ADP to either the PARS Pension Trust or CalPERS would improve the City’s situation
         with minimal impact on service delivery or staff time.

    5) Establish funding level guidelines for the PARS Section 115 Pension Trust.

         The City maintains two trust funds, one for pension that was established in 2017 and
         one for Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) that was established in 2008. The PARS
         OPEB Trust was begun with funding of $33 million and has grown to $102 million as of
         April 2018. The City Council has continued to approve the full funding of the ADC for
         OPEB, helping to close the unfunded gap. As the City closes that unfunded gap, the
         PARS OPEB trust can be used to pay healthcare benefits from deposits and earnings for
         current and future retirees. Although the PARS Pension Trust has a lower funding level,
         a clear policy regarding its desired funding level would help inform future decisions
         regarding how much to contribute to PARS and when to do so. Staff would further
         research appropriate funding levels for the PARS Pension Trust so a comprehensive
         recommendation can be made including a review of the City’s overall funded ratio with
         CalPERS.


Next Steps

Staff will use the feedback from the Finance Committee on the above options to inform the
drafting of a formal Pension Funding and Reporting Policy and anticipates returning to the
Finance Committee with that policy later in the fall.

RESOURCE IMPACT
The FY 2019 Adopted Operating Budget includes the annual contribution as calculated by
CalPERS. As directed by the City Council, staff will return to the Finance Committee to discuss
the implications of an additional $4.0 million reduction in the General Fund separately.

The actual investment return for Fiscal Year 2017-18 was not known at the time this report was prepared. The
projections above assume the investment return for that year would be 7.25 percent. If the actual investment
return for Fiscal Year 2017-18 differs from 7.25 percent, the actual contribution requirements for the
projected years will differ from those shown above.

Moreover, the projected results for Fiscal Year 2020-21 assume that there are no future Plan changes, no further
changes in assumptions other than those recently approved and no liability gains or losses. Such changes can have a
significant impact on required contributions. Since they cannot be predicted in advance, the projected employer results
shown above are estimates. The actual required employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2020-21 will be provided in next
year’s report.

For additional details regarding the assumptions and methods used for these projections please refer to the “Projected
Employer Contributions” in the “Highlights and Executive Summary” section.

The required contributions shown above include a Normal Cost component expressed as a percentage of payroll and a
payment toward Unfunded Accrued Liability expressed as a dollar amount. For illustrative total contribution
requirements expressed as percentages of payroll, please see pages 4 and 5 of the report.

The “Risk Analysis” section of the valuation report starting on page 22 also contains estimated employer contributions
in future years under a variety of investment return scenarios.

Changes since the Prior Year’s Valuation

At its December 2016 meeting, the CalPERS Board of Administration lowered the discount rate from 7.50 percent to
7.00 percent using a three-year phase-in beginning with the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation. The minimum employer
contributions for Fiscal Year 2019-20 determined in this valuation were calculated using a discount rate of 7.25
percent. The projected employer contributions on Page 5 are calculated under the assumption that the discount rate
will be lowered to 7.00 percent next year, as adopted by the Board.

On December 19, 2017, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted new actuarial assumptions based on the
recommendations in the December 2017 CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions. This study
reviewed the retirement rates, termination rates, mortality rates, rates of salary increases and inflation assumption for
Public Agencies. These new assumptions are incorporated in your actuarial valuations and will impact the required
contribution for FY 2019-20. In addition, the Board adopted a new asset portfolio as part of its Asset Liability
Management. The new asset mix supports a 7.00 percent discount rate. The reduction of the inflation assumption will
be implemented in two steps in conjunction with the decreases in the discount rate. For the June 30, 2017 valuation an
inflation rate of 2.625 percent will be used and a rate of 2.50 percent will be used in the following valuation.

The CalPERS Board of Administration has adopted a new amortization policy effective with the June 30, 2019 actuarial
valuation. The new policy shortens the period over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized from 30 years to 20
years with the payments computed using a level dollar amount. In addition, the new policy removes the 5-year ramp-
up and ramp-down on UAL bases attributable to assumption changes and non-investment gains/losses. The new policy
removes the 5-year ramp-down on investment gains/losses. These changes will apply only to new UAL bases
established on or after June 30, 2019.

For inactive employers the new amortization policy imposes a maximum amortization period of 15 years for all
unfunded accrued liabilities effective June 30, 2017. Furthermore, the plan actuary has the ability to shorten the
amortization period on any valuation date based on the life expectancy of plan members and projected cash flow
needs to the plan. The impact of this has been reflected in the current valuation results.

Beginning with Fiscal Year 2017-18 CalPERS began collecting employer contributions toward the plan’s unfunded
liability as dollar amounts instead of the prior method of a contribution rate. This change addressed potential funding
issues that could arise from a declining payroll or reduction in the number of active members in the plan. Funding the
unfunded liability as a percentage of payroll could lead to the underfunding of the plans. Due to stakeholder feedback
regarding internal needs for total contributions expressed as a percentage of payroll, the reports include such results in
the contribution projection on page 5. These results are provided for information purposes only. Contributions toward
the unfunded liability will continue to be collected as dollar amounts.

The CalPERS Board of Administration adopted a Risk Mitigation Policy which is designed to reduce funding risk over
time. This Policy has been temporarily suspended during the period over which the discount rate is being lowered.
More details on the Risk Mitigation Policy can be found on our website.

Besides the above noted changes, there may also be changes specific to the plan such as contract amendments and
funding changes.

Further descriptions of general changes are included in the “Highlights and Executive Summary” section and in
Appendix A, “Actuarial Methods and Assumptions.” The effects of the changes on the required contributions are
included in the “Reconciliation of Required Employer Contributions” section.

We understand that you might have some questions about these results. While we are very interested in discussing
these results with your agency, in the interest of allowing us to give every public agency their results, we ask that you
wait until after August 1, 2018 to contact us with actuarial questions. If you have other questions, you may call the
Customer Contact Center at (888)-CalPERS or (888-225-7377).

CalPERS Actuarial Valuation - June 30, 2017
Safety Plan of the City of Palo Alto
CalPERS ID: 6373437857


Introduction
This report presents the results of the June 30, 2017 actuarial valuation of the Safety Plan of the City of
Palo Alto of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). This actuarial valuation sets the
minimum required employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2019-20.



Purpose of the Report
The actuarial valuation was prepared by the CalPERS Actuarial Office using data as of June 30, 2017. The
purpose of the report is to:

•   Set forth the assets and accrued liabilities of this plan as of June 30, 2017;
•   Determine the minimum required employer contributions for the fiscal year July 1, 2019 through June
    30, 2020;
•   Provide actuarial information as of June 30, 2017 to the CalPERS Board of Administration and other
    interested parties.

The pension funding information presented in this report should not be used in financial reports subject to
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68 for an Agent Employer Defined Benefit
Pension Plan. A separate accounting valuation report for such purposes is available from CalPERS and
details for ordering are available on our website.

The measurements shown in this actuarial valuation may not be applicable for other purposes. The
employer should contact their actuary before disseminating any portion of this report for any reason that is
not explicitly described above.

Future actuarial measurements may differ significantly from the current measurements presented in this
report due to such factors as the following: plan experience differing from that anticipated by the economic
or demographic assumptions; changes in economic or demographic assumptions; changes in actuarial
policies; and changes in plan provisions or applicable law.


California Actuarial Advisory Panel Recommendations

This report includes all the basic disclosure elements as described in the Model Disclosure Elements for
Actuarial Valuation Reports recommended in 2011 by the California Actuarial Advisory Panel (CAAP), with
the exception of including the original base amounts of the various components of the unfunded liability in
the Schedule of Amortization Bases shown on page 16.

Additionally, this report includes the following “Enhanced Risk Disclosures” also recommended by the CAAP
in the Model Disclosure Elements document:

    •    A “Deterministic Stress Test,” projecting future results under different investment income scenarios
    •    A “Sensitivity Analysis,” showing the impact on current valuation results using alternative discount
         rates of 6.0 percent, 7.0 percent and 8.0 percent.

 The total minimum required employer contribution is the sum of the Plan’s Employer Normal Cost Rate
 (expressed as a percentage of payroll) plus the Employer Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) Contribution
 Amount (billed monthly in dollars).

 Only the UAL portion of the employer contribution can be prepaid (which must be received in full no
 later than July 31). Plan Normal Cost contributions will be made as part of the payroll reporting
 process. If there is contractual cost sharing or other change, this amount will change.

 In accordance with Sections 20537 and 20572 of the Public Employees’ Retirement Law, if a contracting
 agency fails to remit the required contributions when due, interest and penalties may apply.

 For additional detail regarding the determination of the required contribution for PEPRA members, see
 Appendix D. Required member contributions for Classic members can be found in Appendix B.

    For classic members, this is the percentage specified in the Public Employees Retirement Law, net of any reduction from
    the use of a modified formula or other factors. For PEPRA members, the member contribution rate is based on 50
    percent of the normal cost. A development of PEPRA member contribution rates can be found in Appendix D. Employee
    cost sharing is not shown in this report.

    This measure of funded status is an assessment of the need for future employer contributions based on the
    selected actuarial cost method used to fund the plan. The UAL is the present value of future employer
    contributions for service that has already been earned and is in addition to future normal cost contributions
    for active members. For a measure of funded status that is appropriate for assessing the sufficiency of plan
    assets to cover estimated termination liabilities, please see “Hypothetical Termination Liability” in the “Risk
    Analysis” section.



    Projected Employer Contributions
    The table below shows the required and projected employer contributions (before cost sharing) for the next
    six fiscal years. Projected results reflect the adopted changes to the discount rate described in Appendix A,
    “Actuarial Methods and Assumptions.” The projections also assume that all actuarial assumptions will be
    realized and that no further changes to assumptions, contributions, benefits, or funding will occur during the
    projection period. The projected normal cost percentages in the projections below do not reflect that the
    normal cost will decline over time as new employees are hired into PEPRA or other lower cost benefit tiers.

    Changes in the UAL due to actuarial gains or losses as well as changes in actuarial assumptions or methods
    are amortized using a 5-year ramp up. For more information, please see “Amortization of the Unfunded
    Actuarial Accrued Liability” under “Actuarial Methods” in Appendix A. This method phases in the impact of
    changes in UAL over a 5-year period and attempts to minimize employer cost volatility from year to year. As
    a result of this methodology, dramatic changes in the required employer contributions in any one year are
    less likely. However, required contributions can change gradually and significantly over the next five years.
    In years where there is a large increase in UAL the relatively small amortization payments during the ramp
    up period could result in a funded ratio that is projected to decrease initially while the contribution impact of
    the increase in the UAL is phased in.

    Due to the adopted change in the discount rate for the next valuation in combination with the 5-year phase-
    in ramp, the increases in the required contributions are expected to continue for six years from Fiscal Year
    2019-20 through Fiscal Year 2024-25.

    For projected contributions under alternate investment return scenarios, please see the “Analysis of Future
    Investment Return Scenarios” in the “Risk Analysis” section.

Cost
Actuarial Cost Estimates in General

What is the cost of the pension plan?

Contributions to fund the pension plan are comprised of two components:

    •   The Normal Cost, expressed as a percentage of total active payroll.
    •   The Amortization of the Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL), expressed as a dollar amount.

For fiscal years prior to FY 2017-18, the Amortizations of UAL component was expressed as percentage of
total active payroll. Starting with FY 2017-18, the Amortization of UAL component was expressed as a dollar
amount and invoiced on a monthly basis. There continues to be an option to prepay this amount during July
of each fiscal year.

The Normal Cost component will continue to be expressed as a percentage of active payroll with employer
and employee contributions payable as part of the regular payroll reporting process.

The determination of both components requires complex actuarial calculations. The calculations are based
on a set of actuarial assumptions which can be divided into two categories:

    •   Demographic assumptions (which includes mortality rates, retirement rates, employment
        termination rates and disability rates)
    •   Economic assumptions (which includes future investment earnings, inflation, salary growth rates)

These assumptions reflect CalPERS best estimate of the future experience of the plan and are long term in
nature. We recognize that all the assumptions will not be realized in any given year. For example, the
investment earnings at CalPERS have averaged 6.6 percent over the 20 years ending June 30, 2017, yet
individual fiscal year returns have ranged from -24.0 percent to +21.7 percent. In addition, CalPERS reviews
all the actuarial assumptions on an ongoing basis by conducting in-depth experience studies every four
years, with the most recent experience study completed in 2017.




                                                                                                     Page 6

Changes since the Prior Year’s Valuation
Benefits

The standard actuarial practice at CalPERS is to recognize mandated legislative benefit changes in the first
annual valuation following the effective date of the legislation. Voluntary benefit changes by plan amendment
are generally included in the first valuation that is prepared after the amendment becomes effective, even if
the valuation date is prior to the effective date of the amendment.

This valuation generally reflects plan changes by amendments effective before the date of the report. Please
refer to the “Plan’s Major Benefit Options” and Appendix B for a summary of the plan provisions used in this
valuation. The effect of any mandated benefit changes or plan amendments on the unfunded liability is
shown in the “(Gain)/Loss Analysis” and the effect on the employer contribution is shown in the
“Reconciliation of Required Employer Contributions.” It should be noted that no change in liability or
contribution is shown for any plan changes which were already included in the prior year’s valuation.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions

On December 21, 2016, the CalPERS Board of Administration lowered the discount rate from 7.50 percent to
7.00 percent using a three-year phase-in beginning with the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation. The minimum
employer contribution for Fiscal Year 2019-20 determined in this valuation was calculated using a discount
rate of 7.25 percent. The projected employer contributions on Page 5 are calculated assuming that the
discount rate will be lowered to 7.00 percent next year as adopted by the Board. The decision to reduce the
discount rate was primarily based on reduced capital market assumptions provided by external investment
consultants and CalPERS investment staff. The specific decision adopted by the Board reflected
recommendations from CalPERS staff and additional input from employer and employee stakeholder groups.
Based on the investment allocation adopted by the Board and capital market assumptions, the reduced
discount rate assumption provides a more realistic assumption for the long-term investment return of the
fund.

On December 19, 2017, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted new actuarial assumptions based on
the recommendations in the December 2017 CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions.
This study reviewed the retirement rates, termination rates, mortality rates, rates of salary increases and
inflation assumption for Public Agencies. These new assumptions are incorporated in this actuarial valuation
and will impact the required contribution for FY 2019-20. In addition, the Board adopted a new asset
portfolio as part of its Asset Liability Management. The new asset mix supports a 7.00 percent discount rate.
The reduction of the inflation assumption will be implemented in two steps in conjunction with the decreases
in the discount rate. For the June 30, 2017 valuation an inflation rate of 2.625 percent will be used and a rate
of 2.50 percent will be used in the following valuation.

Notwithstanding the Board’s decision to phase into a 7.0 percent discount rate, subsequent analysis of the
expected investment return of CalPERS assets or changes to the investment allocation may result in a change
to this discount rate schedule.



Subsequent Events
The CalPERS Board of Administration has adopted a new amortization policy effective with the June 30, 2019
actuarial valuation. The new policy shortens the period over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized
from 30 years to 20 years with the payments computed using a level dollar amount. In addition, the new
policy removes the 5-year ramp-up and ramp-down on UAL bases attributable to assumption changes and
non-investment gains/losses. The new policy removes the 5-year ramp-down on investment gains/losses.
These changes will apply only to new UAL bases established on or after June 30, 2019.

For inactive employers the new amortization policy imposes a maximum amortization period of 15 years for
all unfunded accrued liabilities effective June 30, 2017. Furthermore, the plan actuary has the ability to
shorten the amortization period on any valuation date based on the life expectancy of plan members and
projected cash flow needs to the plan. The impact of this has been reflected in the current valuation results.

                                                                                                       Page 7

The contribution requirements determined in this actuarial valuation report are based on demographic and
financial information as of June 30, 2017. Changes in the value of assets subsequent to that date are not
reflected. Investment returns below the assumed rate of return will increase the retired contribution, while
investment returns above the assumed rate of return will decrease the retired contribution.

Asset Allocation
CalPERS adheres to an Asset Allocation Strategy which establishes asset class allocation policy targets and
ranges, and manages those asset class allocations within their policy ranges. CalPERS Investment Belief No.
6 recognizes that strategic asset allocation is the dominant determinant of portfolio risk and return. On
December 19, 2017, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted changes to the current asset allocation as
shown in the Policy Target Allocation below expressed as a percentage of total assets.

The asset allocation and market value of assets shown below reflect the values of the Public Employees’
Retirement Fund (PERF) in its entirety as of June 30, 2017. The assets for City of Palo Alto Safety Plan are

The table below shows historical geometric mean annual returns of the Public Employees Retirement Fund
for various time periods ending on June 30, 2017 (figures are reported as gross of fees). The geometric
mean rate of return is the average rate per period compounded over multiple periods. It should be
recognized that in any given year the rate of return is volatile. The portfolio has an expected volatility of
11.4 percent per year based on the most recent Asset Liability Modelling study. The volatility is a measure of
the risk of the portfolio expressed in the standard deviation of the fund’s total return distribution, expressed
as a percentage. Consequently, when looking at investment returns, it is more instructive to look at returns
over longer time horizons.

(Gain)/Loss Analysis 6/30/16 – 6/30/17
To calculate the cost requirements of the plan, assumptions are made about future events that affect the
amount and timing of benefits to be paid and assets to be accumulated. Each year, actual experience is
compared to the expected experience based on the actuarial assumptions. This results in actuarial gains or
losses, as shown below.

     Schedule of Amortization Bases
     There is a two-year lag between the valuation date and the start of the contribution fiscal year.
     •   The assets, liabilities, and funded status of the plan are measured as of the valuation date: June 30, 2017.
     •   The required employer contributions determined by the valuation are for the fiscal year beginning two years after the valuation date: Fiscal Year 2019-20.

     This two-year lag is necessary due to the amount of time needed to extract and test the membership and financial data, and the need to provide public agencies
     with their required employer contribution well in advance of the start of the fiscal year.

     The Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) is used to determine the employer contribution and therefore must be rolled forward two years from the valuation date to the
     first day of the fiscal year for which the contribution is being determined. The UAL is rolled forward each year by subtracting the expected payment on the UAL for the
     fiscal year and adjusting for interest. The expected payment on the UAL for a fiscal year is equal to the Expected Employer Contribution for the fiscal year minus the
     Expected Normal Cost for the year. The Employer Contribution for the first fiscal year is determined by the actuarial valuation two years ago and the contribution for
     the second year is from the actuarial valuation one year ago. Additional discretionary payments are reflected in the Expected Payments column in the fiscal year they
     were made by the agency.

Amortization Schedule and Alternatives
The amortization schedule on the previous page shows the minimum contributions required according to
CalPERS amortization policy. There has been considerable interest from many agencies in paying off these
unfunded accrued liabilities sooner and the possible savings in doing so. As a result, we have provided
alternate amortization schedules to help analyze the current amortization schedule and illustrate the
advantages of accelerating unfunded liability payments.

Shown on the following page are future year amortization payments based on 1) the current amortization
schedule reflecting the individual bases and remaining periods shown on the previous page, and 2) alternate
“fresh start” amortization schedules using two sample periods that would both result in interest savings
relative to the current amortization schedule. Note that the payments under each alternate scenario
increase by 2.875 percent per year. The schedules do not reflect the impact of adopted discount
rate changes that will become effective beyond June 30, 2017. Therefore, future amortization
payments displayed in the Current Amortization Schedule on the following page will not match
projected amortization payments shown in connection with Projected Employer Contributions
provided elsewhere in this report.

The Current Amortization Schedule typically contains individual bases that are both positive and negative.
Positive bases result from plan changes, assumption changes or plan experience that result in increases to
unfunded liability. Negative bases result from plan changes, assumption changes or plan experience that
result in decreases to unfunded liability. The combination of positive and negative bases within an
amortization schedule can result in unusual or problematic circumstances in future years such as:

    •    A positive total unfunded liability with a negative total payment,
    •    A negative total unfunded liability with a positive total payment, or
    •    Total payments that completely amortize the unfunded liability over a very short period of time

In any year where one of the above scenarios occurs, the actuary will consider corrective action such as
replacing the existing unfunded liability bases with a single “fresh start” base and amortizing it over a
reasonable period.

The Current Amortization Schedule on the following page may appear to show that, based on the current
amortization bases, one of the above scenarios will occur at some point in the future. It is impossible to
know today whether such a scenario will in fact arise since there will be additional bases added to the
amortization schedule in each future year. Should such a scenario arise in any future year, the actuary will
take appropriate action based on guidelines in the CalPERS amortization policy.

    The unfunded liability contribution for the (gain)/loss during the year prior to the valuation date is 20 percent of the
    “full” annual requirement due to the 5-year ramp. Increases to this amount that occur during the ramp period will be
    included in line d) in future years.

    Includes changes due to 5-year ramp, payroll growth assumption, and re-amortization under new discount rate.



The amounts shown for the period 7/1/18 – 6/30/19 may be different if a prepayment of unfunded actuarial
liability is made or a plan change became effective after the prior year’s actuarial valuation was performed.

Analysis of Future Investment Return Scenarios
Analysis was performed to determine the effects of various future investment returns on required employer
contributions. The projections below provide a range of results based on five investment return scenarios
assumed to occur during the next four fiscal years (2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21). The
projections also assume that all other actuarial assumptions will be realized and that no further changes to
assumptions, contributions, benefits, or funding will occur.

Each of the five investment return scenarios assumes a return of 7.25 percent for fiscal year 2017-18. For
fiscal years 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 each scenario assumes an alternate fixed annual return. The
fixed return assumptions for the five scenarios are 1.0 percent, 4.0 percent, 7.0 percent, 9.0 percent and
12.0 percent.

The alternate investment returns were chosen based on stochastic analysis of possible future investment
returns over the four-year period ending June 30, 2021. Using the expected returns and volatility of the
asset classes in which the funds are invested, we produced five thousand stochastic outcomes for this
period based on the recently completed Asset Liability Management process. We then selected annual
returns that approximate the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles for these outcomes. For example, of
all the 4-year outcomes generated in the stochastic analysis, approximately 25 percent of them had an
average annual return of 4.0 percent or less.

Required contributions outside of this range are also possible. In particular, whereas it is unlikely that
investment returns will average less than 1.0 percent or greater than 12.0 percent over this four-year
period, the possibility of a single investment return less than 1.0 percent or greater than 12.0 percent in any
given year is much greater.

Given the temporary suspension of the Risk Mitigation Policy during the period over which the discount rate
assumption is being phased down to 7.0 percent, the projections above were performed without reflection
of any possible impact of this Policy for Fiscal Year 2020-21.

The projected normal cost percentages do not reflect that the normal cost will decline over time as new
employees are hired into PEPRA or other lower cost benefit tiers. In addition, the projections above do not
reflect the recent changes to the amortization policy effective with the June 30, 2019 valuation but the
impact on the results above is expected to be minimal.

Analysis of Discount Rate Sensitivity
Shown below are various valuation results as of June 30, 2017 assuming alternate discount rates. Results
are shown using the current discount rate of 7.25 percent as well as alternate discount rates of 6.0 percent,
7.0 percent, and 8.0 percent. The alternate rate of 7.0 percent was selected since the Board has adopted
this rate as the final discount rate at the end of the three-year phase-in of the reduction in this assumption.
The rates of 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent were selected since they illustrate the impact of a 1 percent
increase or decrease to the 7.0 percent assumption. This analysis shows the potential plan impacts if the
PERF were to realize investment returns of 6.0 percent, 7.0 percent, or 8.0 percent over the long-term.

This type of analysis gives the reader a sense of the long-term risk to required contributions. For a measure
of funded status that is appropriate for assessing the sufficiency of plan assets to cover estimated
termination liabilities, please see “Hypothetical Termination Liability” at the end of this section.

Volatility Ratios
The actuarial calculations supplied in this communication are based on various assumptions about long-term
demographic and economic behavior. Unless these assumptions (terminations, deaths, disabilities,
retirements, salary growth, and investment return) are exactly realized each year, there will be differences
on a year-to-year basis. The year-to-year differences between actual experience and the assumptions are
called actuarial gains and losses and serve to lower or raise required employer contributions from one year
to the next. Therefore, employer contributions will inevitably fluctuate, especially due to the ups and downs
of investment returns.

Asset Volatility Ratio (AVR)

Plans that have higher asset-to-payroll ratios experience more volatile employer contributions (as a
percentage of payroll) due to investment return. For example, a plan with an asset-to-payroll ratio of 8 may
experience twice the contribution volatility due to investment return volatility than a plan with an asset-to-
payroll ratio of 4. Shown below is the asset volatility ratio, a measure of the plan’s current volatility. It
should be noted that this ratio is a measure of the current situation. It increases over time but generally
tends to stabilize as the plan matures.

Liability Volatility Ratio (LVR)

Plans that have higher liability-to-payroll ratios experience more volatile employer contributions (as a
percentage of payroll) due to investment return and changes in liability. For example, a plan with a liability-
to-payroll ratio of 8 is expected to have twice the contribution volatility of a plan with a liability-to-payroll
ratio of 4. The liability volatility ratio is also included in the table below. It should be noted that this ratio
indicates a longer-term potential for contribution volatility. The asset volatility ratio, described above, will
tend to move closer to the liability volatility ratio as the plan matures. Since the liability volatility ratio is a
long-term measure, it is shown below at the current discount rate (7.25 percent) as well as the discount
rate the Board has adopted to determine the contribution requirement in the June 30, 2018 actuarial
valuation (7.00 percent).

   Hypothetical Termination Liability
   The hypothetical termination liability is an estimate of the financial position of the plan had the contract with
   CalPERS been terminated as of June 30, 2017. The plan liability on a termination basis is calculated
   differently from the plan’s ongoing funding liability. For this hypothetical termination liability calculation,
   both compensation and service are frozen as of the valuation date and no future pay increases or service
   accruals are assumed. This measure of funded status is not appropriate for assessing the need for future
   employer contributions in the case of an ongoing plan, that is, for an employer that continues to provide
   CalPERS retirement benefits to active employees.

   A more conservative investment policy and asset allocation strategy was adopted by the CalPERS Board for
   the Terminated Agency Pool. The Terminated Agency Pool has limited funding sources since no future
   employer contributions will be made. Therefore, expected benefit payments are secured by risk-free assets
   and benefit security for members is increased while limiting the funding risk. However, this asset allocation
   has a lower expected rate of return than the PERF and consequently, a lower discount rate assumption. The
   lower discount rate for the Terminated Agency Pool results in higher liabilities for terminated plans.

   The effective termination discount rate will depend on actual market rates of return for risk-free securities
   on the date of termination. As market discount rates are variable the table below shows a range for the
   hypothetical termination liability based on the lowest and highest interest rates observed during an
   approximate 2-year period centered around the valuation date.

       The hypothetical liabilities calculated above include a 5 percent contingency load in accordance with Board policy.
       Other actuarial assumptions can be found in Appendix A.
   2
       The current discount rate assumption used for termination valuations is a weighted average of the 10-year and 30-year
       U.S. Treasury yields where the weights are based on matching asset and liability durations as of the termination date.
       The discount rates used in the table are based on 20-year Treasury bonds, rounded to the nearest quarter percentage
       point, which is a good proxy for most plans. The 20-year Treasury yield was 2.61 percent on June 30, 2017, and was

   Resolution of Intent to Terminate. The completed Resolution will allow the plan actuary to give you a
   preliminary termination valuation with a more up-to-date estimate of the plan liabilities. CalPERS advises
   you to consult with the plan actuary before beginning this process.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions



Actuarial Data
As stated in the Actuarial Certification, the data which serves as the basis of this valuation has been
obtained from the various CalPERS databases. We have reviewed the valuation data and believe that it is
reasonable and appropriate in aggregate. We are unaware of any potential data issues that would have a
material effect on the results of this valuation, except that data does not always contain the latest salary
information for former members now in reciprocal systems and does not recognize the potential for
unusually large salary deviation in certain cases such as elected officials. Therefore, salary information in
these cases may not be accurate. These situations are relatively infrequent, however, and when they do
occur, they generally do not have a material impact on the required employer contributions.



Actuarial Methods
Actuarial Cost Method

The actuarial cost method used is the Entry Age Normal Cost Method. Under this method, projected benefits
are determined for all members and the associated liabilities are spread in a manner that produces level
annual cost as a percentage of pay in each year from the member’s entry age to their assumed retirement
age on the valuation date. The cost allocated to the current fiscal year is called the normal cost.

The actuarial accrued liability for active members is then calculated as the portion of the total cost of the
plan allocated to prior years. The actuarial accrued liability for members currently receiving benefits and for
members entitled to deferred benefits is equal to the present value of the benefits expected to be paid. No
normal costs are applicable for these participants.


Amortization of Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability

The excess of the total actuarial accrued liability over the market value of plan assets is called the unfunded
actuarial accrued liability (UAL). Funding requirements are determined by adding the normal cost and an
amortization payment toward the unfunded liability. The unfunded liability is amortized as a “level percent
of pay”. Commencing with the June 30, 2013 valuation, all new gains or losses are amortized over a fixed
30-year period with a 5-year ramp up at the beginning and a 5-year ramp down at the end of the
amortization period. All changes in liability due to plan amendments (other than golden handshakes) are
amortized over a 20-year period with no ramp. Changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in actuarial
methodology are amortized over a 20-year period with a 5-year ramp up at the beginning and a 5-year
ramp down at the end of the amortization period. Changes in unfunded accrued liability due to a Golden
Handshake will be amortized over a period of five years. A summary of the current policy is provided in the
table below:

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions


The 5-year ramp up means that the payments in the first four years of the amortization period are 20
percent, 40 percent, 60 percent and 80 percent of the “full” payment which begins in year five. The 5-year
ramp down means that the reverse is true in the final four years of the amortization period.

Exceptions for Inconsistencies:

An exception to the amortization rules above is used whenever their application results in inconsistencies. In
these cases, a “fresh start” approach is used. This means that the current unfunded actuarial liability is
projected and amortized over a set number of years. For example, a fresh start is needed in the following
situations:

    •    When a positive payment would be required on a negative unfunded actuarial liability (or
         conversely a negative payment on a positive unfunded actuarial liability); or
    •    When there are excess assets, rather than an unfunded liability. In this situation, a 30-year fresh
         start is used.

It should be noted that the actuary may determine that a fresh start is necessary under other
circumstances. In all cases of a fresh start, the period is set by the actuary at what is deemed appropriate;
however, the period will not be greater than 30 years.


Exceptions for Inactive Plans:

The following exceptions apply to plans classified as Inactive. These plans have no active members and no
expectation to have active members in the future.

    •    Amortization of the unfunded liability is on a “level dollar” basis rather than a “level percent of pay”
         basis. For amortization layers, which utilize a ramp up and ramp down, the “ultimate” payment is
         constant.
    •    Actuarial judgment will be used to shorten amortization periods for Inactive plans with existing
         periods that are deemed too long given the duration of the liability. The specific demographics of
         the plan will be used to determine if shorter periods may be more appropriate.


Asset Valuation Method

It is the policy of the CalPERS Board of Administration to use professionally accepted amortization methods
to eliminate a surplus or an unfunded accrued liability in a manner that maintains benefit security for the
members of the System while minimizing substantial variations in required employer contributions. On April
17, 2013, the CalPERS Board of Administration approved a recommendation to change the CalPERS
amortization and rate smoothing policies. Beginning with the June 30, 2013 valuations that set the employer
contribution for Fiscal Year 2015-16, CalPERS employs a policy that amortizes all gains and losses over a
fixed 30-year period. The increase or decrease in the rate is then spread directly over a 5-year period. This
method is referred to as “direct rate smoothing.” CalPERS no longer uses an actuarial value of assets and
only uses the market value of assets. The direct rate smoothing method is equivalent to a method using a
5-year asset smoothing period with no actuarial value of asset corridor and a 25-year amortization period
for gains and losses.


PEPRA Normal Cost Rate Methodology

Per Government Code Section 7522.30(b) the “normal cost rate” shall mean the annual actuarially
determined normal cost for the plan of retirement benefits provided to the new member and shall be
established based on actuarial assumptions used to determine the liabilities and costs as part of the annual
actuarial valuation. The plan of retirement benefits shall include any elements that would impact the
actuarial determination of the normal cost, including, but not limited to, the retirement formula, eligibility
and vesting criteria, ancillary benefit provisions, and any automatic cost-of-living adjustments as determined
by the public retirement system.

CalPERS Actuarial Valuation – June 30, 2017                                                    Appendix A
Actuarial Methods and Assumptions


Each non-pooled plan is stable with a sufficiently large demographic representation of active employees. It
is preferable to determine normal cost using a large active population ongoing so that this rate remains
relatively stable. The total PEPRA normal cost will be calculated using all active members within a non-
pooled plan until the number of members covered under the PEPRA formula meets either:

    1.   50 percent of the active population, or
    2.   25 percent of the active population and 100 or more PEPRA members

Once either of the conditions above is met for a non-pooled plan, the total PEPRA normal cost will be based
on the active PEPRA population in the plan.

Accordingly, the total normal cost will be funded equally between employer and employee based on the
demographics of the employees of that employer.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions



Actuarial Assumptions
In 2017, CalPERS completed its most recent asset liability management study incorporating actuarial
assumptions and strategic asset allocation. In December 2017, the CalPERS Board of Administration
adopted relatively modest changes to the asset allocation that reduced the expected volatility of returns.
The adopted asset allocation was expected to have a long-term blended return that continued to support a
discount rate assumption of 7.00 percent. The Board also approved several changes to the demographic
assumptions that more closely aligned with actual experience. These new actuarial assumptions were first
used in this, the June 30, 2017 valuation to set the Fiscal Year 2019-20 contribution for public agency
employers.

On December 21, 2016, the CalPERS Board of Administration lowered the discount rate from 7.50 percent to
7.00 percent using a three-year phase-in beginning with the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuations. The
minimum employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2019-20 determined in this valuation were calculated using
a discount rate of 7.25 percent. The projected employer contributions on Page 5 are calculated assuming
that the discount rate will be lowered to 7.00 percent next year as adopted by the Board. The decision to
reduce the discount rate was primarily based on reduced capital market assumptions provided by external
investment consultants and CalPERS investment staff. The specific decision adopted by the Board reflected
recommendations from CalPERS staff and additional input from employer and employee stakeholder groups.
Based on the investment allocation adopted by the Board and capital market assumptions, the reduced
discount rate schedule provides a more realistic assumption for the long-term investment return of the fund.

Notwithstanding the Board’s decision to phase into a 7.0 percent discount rate, subsequent analysis of the
expected investment return of CalPERS assets or changes to the investment allocation may result in a
change to this discount rate schedule.

For more details and additional rationale for the selection of the actuarial assumptions, please refer to the
CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions report from December 2017 that can be
found on the CalPERS website under: “Forms and Publications”. Click on “View All” and search for
Experience Study.

All actuarial assumptions (except the discount rates used for the hypothetical termination liability) represent
an estimate of future experience rather than observations of the estimates inherent in market data.

Economic Assumptions

    Discount Rate
        The prescribed discount rate assumption adopted by the Board on December 21, 2016 is 7.25
        percent compounded annually (net of investment and administrative expenses) as of 6/30/2017.

         The Board also prescribed that the assumed discount rate will reduce to 7.0 percent compounded
         annually (net of expenses) as of 6/30/2018. This change to the discount rate assumption is not
         reflected in the determination of required contributions determined in this report for Fiscal Year
         2019-20.

    Termination Liability Discount Rate
       The current discount rate assumption used for termination valuations is a weighted average of the
       10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields where the weights are based on matching asset and
       liability durations as of the termination date.

         The hypothetical termination liabilities in this report are calculated using an observed range of
         market interest rates. This range is based on the lowest and highest 20-year Treasury bond
         observed during an approximate 2-year period centered around the valuation date. The 20-year
         Treasury bond has a similar duration to most plan liabilities and serves as a good proxy for the
         termination discount rate. The 20-year Treasury yield was 2.61 percent on June 30, 2017.

        •    The Miscellaneous salary scale is used for Local Prosecutors.
        •    The Police salary scale is used for Other Safety, Local Sheriff, and School Police.

    Overall Payroll Growth
       2.875 percent compounded annually (used in projecting the payroll over which the unfunded
       liability is amortized). This assumption is used for all plans with active members. For the June 30,
       2018 valuation the payroll growth assumption will be 2.75 percent.

    Inflation
        2.625 percent compounded annually. For the June 30, 2018 valuation the inflation assumption will
        be 2.50 percent.

    Non-valued Potential Additional Liabilities
       The potential liability loss for a cost-of-living increase exceeding the 2.625 percent inflation
       assumption, and any potential liability loss from future member service purchases are not reflected
       in the valuation.

Miscellaneous Loading Factors

    Credit for Unused Sick Leave
       Total years of service is increased by 1 percent for those plans that have adopted the provision of
       providing Credit for Unused Sick Leave.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions


    Conversion of Employer Paid Member Contributions (EPMC)
       Total years of service is increased by the Employee Contribution Rate for those plans with the
       provision providing for the Conversion of Employer Paid Member Contributions (EPMC) during the
       final compensation period.

    Norris Decision (Best Factors)
       Employees hired prior to July 1, 1982 have projected benefit amounts increased in order to reflect
       the use of “Best Factors” in the calculation of optional benefit forms. This is due to a 1983
       Supreme Court decision, known as the Norris decision, which required males and females to be
       treated equally in the determination of benefit amounts. Consequently, anyone already employed
       at that time is given the best possible conversion factor when optional benefits are determined. No
       loading is necessary for employees hired after July 1, 1982.

   Termination Liability
       The termination liabilities include a 5 percent contingency load. This load is for unforeseen negative
       experience.

Demographic Assumptions

    Pre-Retirement Mortality
        Non-industrial death rates vary by age and gender. Industrial death rates vary by age. See sample
        rates in table below. The non-industrial death rates are used for all plans. The industrial death
        rates are used for safety plans (except for Local Prosecutor safety members where the
        corresponding miscellaneous plan does not have the Industrial Death Benefit).

       Miscellaneous plans usually have industrial death rates set to zero unless the agency has specifically
       contracted for industrial death benefits. If so, each non-industrial death rate shown above will be
       split into two components; 99 percent will become the non-industrial death rate and 1 percent will
       become the industrial death rate.

Internal Revenue Code Section 415

The limitations on benefits imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 415 are taken into account in this
valuation. Each year the impact of any changes in this limitation since the prior valuation is included and
amortized as part of the actuarial gain or loss base. This results in lower contributions for those employers
contributing to the Replacement Benefit Fund and protects CalPERS from prefunding expected benefits in
excess of limits imposed by federal tax law.

Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) (17)

The limitations on compensation imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) (17) are taken into
account in this valuation. Each year, the impact of any changes in the compensation limitation since the
prior valuation is included and amortized as part of the actuarial gain or loss base. The compensation limit
for classic members for the 2017 calendar year is $270,000.

Principal Plan Provisions


The following is a description of the principal plan provisions used in calculating costs and liabilities. We have
indicated whether a plan provision is standard or optional. Standard benefits are applicable to all members while
optional benefits vary among employers. Optional benefits that apply to a single period of time, such as Golden
Handshakes, have not been included. Many of the statements in this summary are general in nature, and are
intended to provide an easily understood summary of the Public Employees’ Retirement Law. The law itself governs
in all situations.



Service Retirement
Eligibility

A classic CalPERS member or PEPRA Safety member becomes eligible for Service Retirement upon attainment of age
50 with at least 5 years of credited service (total service across all CalPERS employers, and with certain other
retirement systems with which CalPERS has reciprocity agreements). For employees hired into a plan with the 1.5
percent at 65 formula, eligibility for service retirement is age 55 with at least 5 years of service. PEPRA miscellaneous
members become eligible for service retirement upon attainment of age 52 with at least 5 years of service.

Benefit

The service retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the product of the benefit factor, years of service, and
final compensation.

•     The benefit factor depends on the benefit formula specified in your agency’s contract. The table below shows
      the factors for each of the available formulas. Factors vary by the member’s age at retirement. Listed are the
      factors for retirement at whole year ages:

* For this formula, the benefit factor also varies by entry age. The factors shown are for members with an entry age
of 35 or greater. If entry age is less than 35, then the age 55 benefit factor is 50 percent divided by the difference
between age 55 and entry age. The benefit factor for ages prior to age 55 is the same proportion of the age 55
benefit factor as in the above table.

•   The years of service is the amount credited by CalPERS to a member while he or she is employed in this group
    (or for other periods that are recognized under the employer’s contract with CalPERS). For a member who has
    earned service with multiple CalPERS employers, the benefit from each employer is calculated separately
    according to each employer’s contract, and then added together for the total allowance. An agency may contract
    for an optional benefit where any unused sick leave accumulated at the time of retirement will be converted to
    credited service at a rate of 0.004 years of service for each day of sick leave.

•   The final compensation is the monthly average of the member’s highest 36 or 12 consecutive months’ full-time
    equivalent monthly pay (no matter which CalPERS employer paid this compensation). The standard benefit is 36
    months. Employers had the option of providing a final compensation equal to the highest 12 consecutive months
    for classic plans only. Final compensation must be defined by the highest 36 consecutive months’ pay under the
    1.5% at 65 formula. PEPRA members have a cap on the annual salary that can be used to calculate final
    compensation for all new members based on the Social Security contribution and benefit base. For employees
    that participate in Social Security this cap is $118,775 for 2017 and for those employees that do not participate
    in Social Security the cap for 2017 is $142,530. Adjustments to the caps are permitted annually based on
    changes to the CPI for all urban consumers.

•   Employees must be covered by Social Security with the 1.5% at 65 formula. Social Security is optional for all
    other benefit formulas. For employees covered by Social Security, the modified formula is the standard benefit.
    Under this type of formula, the final compensation is offset by $133.33 (or by one third if the final compensation
    is less than $400). Employers may contract for the full benefit with Social Security that will eliminate the offset
    applicable to the final compensation. For employees not covered by Social Security, the full benefit is paid with

Vested Deferred Retirement
Eligibility for Deferred Status

A CalPERS member becomes eligible for a deferred vested retirement benefit when he or she leaves employment,
keeps his or her contribution account balance on deposit with CalPERS, and has earned at least 5 years of credited
service (total service across all CalPERS employers, and with certain other retirement systems with which CalPERS
has reciprocity agreements).

Eligibility to Start Receiving Benefits

The CalPERS classic members and PEPRA safety members become eligible to receive the deferred retirement benefit
upon satisfying the eligibility requirements for deferred status and upon attainment of age 50 (55 for employees
hired into a 1.5% @ 65 plan). PEPRA miscellaneous members become eligible to receive the deferred retirement
benefit upon satisfying the eligibility requirements for deferred status and upon attainment of age 52.

Benefit

The vested deferred retirement benefit is the same as the service retirement benefit, where the benefit factor is
based on the member’s age at allowance commencement. For members who have earned service with multiple
CalPERS employers, the benefit from each employer is calculated separately according to each employer’s contract,
and then added together for the total allowance.



Non-Industrial (Non-Job Related) Disability Retirement
Eligibility

A CalPERS member is eligible for Non-Industrial Disability Retirement if he or she becomes disabled and has at least
5 years of credited service (total service across all CalPERS employers, and with certain other retirement systems
with which CalPERS has reciprocity agreements). There is no special age requirement. Disabled means the member is
unable to perform his or her job because of an illness or injury, which is expected to be permanent or to last
indefinitely. The illness or injury does not have to be job related. A CalPERS member must be actively employed by
any CalPERS employer at the time of disability in order to be eligible for this benefit.

Standard Benefit

The standard Non-Industrial Disability Retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to 1.8 percent of final
compensation, multiplied by service, which is determined as follows:

•   Service is CalPERS credited service, for members with less than 10 years of service or greater than 18.518 years
    of service; or

•   Service is CalPERS credited service plus the additional number of years that the member would have worked
    until age 60, for members with at least 10 years but not more than 18.518 years of service. The maximum
    benefit in this case is 33 1/3 percent of final compensation.




                                                                                                                B-3

Safety Plan of the City of Palo Alto
Principal Plan Provisions


Improved Benefit

Employers have the option of providing the improved Non-Industrial Disability Retirement benefit. This benefit
provides a monthly allowance equal to 30 percent of final compensation for the first 5 years of service, plus 1 percent
for each additional year of service to a maximum of 50 percent of final compensation.

Members who are eligible for a larger service retirement benefit may choose to receive that benefit in lieu of a
disability benefit. Members eligible to retire, and who have attained the normal retirement age determined by their
service retirement benefit formula, will receive the same dollar amount for disability retirement as that payable for
service retirement. For members who have earned service with multiple CalPERS employers, the benefit attributed to
each employer is the total disability allowance multiplied by the ratio of service with a particular employer to the total
CalPERS service.



Industrial (Job Related) Disability Retirement
All safety members have this benefit. For miscellaneous members, employers have the option of providing this
benefit. An employer may choose to provide the increased benefit option or the improved benefit option.

Eligibility

An employee is eligible for Industrial Disability Retirement if he or she becomes disabled while working, where
disabled means the member is unable to perform the duties of the job because of a work-related illness or injury,
which is expected to be permanent or to last indefinitely. A CalPERS member who has left active employment within
this group is not eligible for this benefit, except to the extent described below.

Standard Benefit

The standard Industrial Disability Retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to 50 percent of final
compensation.

Increased Benefit (75 percent of Final Compensation)

The increased Industrial Disability Retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to 75 percent final compensation
for total disability.

Improved Benefit (50 percent to 90 percent of Final Compensation)

The improved Industrial Disability Retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the Workman’s Compensation
Appeals Board permanent disability rate percentage (if 50 percent or greater, with a maximum of 90 percent) times
the final compensation.

For a CalPERS member not actively employed in this group who became disabled while employed by some other
CalPERS employer, the benefit is a return of accumulated member contributions with respect to employment in this
group. With the standard or increased benefit, a member may also choose to receive the annuitization of the
accumulated member contributions.

If a member is eligible for service retirement and if the service retirement benefit is more than the industrial disability
retirement benefit, the member may choose to receive the larger benefit.

Post-Retirement Death Benefit
Standard Lump Sum Payment

Upon the death of a retiree, a one-time lump sum payment of $500 will be made to the retiree’s designated
survivor(s), or to the retiree’s estate.

Improved Lump Sum Payment

Employers have the option of providing an improved lump sum death benefit of $600, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 or
$5,000.



Form of Payment for Retirement Allowance
Standard Form of Payment

Generally, the retirement allowance is paid to the retiree in the form of an annuity for as long as he or she is alive.
The retiree may choose to provide for a portion of his or her allowance to be paid to any designated beneficiary after
the retiree’s death. CalPERS provides for a variety of such benefit options, which the retiree pays for by taking a
reduction in his or her retirement allowance. Such reduction takes into account the amount to be provided to the
beneficiary and the probable duration of payments (based on the ages of the member and beneficiary) made
subsequent to the member’s death.

Improved Form of Payment (Post-Retirement Survivor Allowance)

Employers have the option to contract for the post-retirement survivor allowance.

For retirement allowances with respect to service subject to the modified formula, 25 percent of the retirement
allowance will automatically be continued to certain statutory beneficiaries upon the death of the retiree, without a
reduction in the retiree’s allowance. For retirement allowances with respect to service subject to the full or
supplemental formula, 50 percent of the retirement allowance will automatically be continued to certain statutory
beneficiaries upon the death of the retiree, without a reduction in the retiree’s allowance. This additional benefit is
referred to as post-retirement survivor allowance (PRSA) or simply as survivor continuance.

In other words, 25 percent or 50 percent of the allowance, the continuance portion, is paid to the retiree for as long
as he or she is alive, and that same amount is continued to the retiree’s spouse (or if no eligible spouse, to
unmarried child(ren) until they attain age 18; or, if no eligible child(ren), to a qualifying dependent parent) for the
rest of his or her lifetime. This benefit will not be discontinued in the event the spouse remarries.

The remaining 75 percent or 50 percent of the retirement allowance, which may be referred to as the option portion
of the benefit, is paid to the retiree as an annuity for as long as he or she is alive. Or, the retiree may choose to
provide for some of this option portion to be paid to any designated beneficiary after the retiree’s death. Benefit
options applicable to the option portion are the same as those offered with the standard form. The reduction is
calculated in the same manner but is applied only to the option portion.

Pre-Retirement Death Benefits

Basic Death Benefit
This is a standard benefit.

Eligibility

An employee’s beneficiary (or estate) may receive the basic death benefit if the member dies while actively
employed. A CalPERS member must be actively employed with the CalPERS employer providing this benefit to be
eligible for this benefit. A member’s survivor who is eligible for any other pre-retirement death benefit may choose to
receive that death benefit instead of this basic death benefit.

Benefit

The basic death benefit is a lump sum in the amount of the member’s accumulated contributions, where interest is
currently credited at 7.5 percent per year, plus a lump sum in the amount of one month's salary for each completed
year of current service, up to a maximum of six months' salary. For purposes of this benefit, one month's salary is
defined as the member's average monthly full-time rate of compensation during the 12 months preceding death.



1957 Survivor Benefit
This is a standard benefit.

Eligibility

An employee’s eligible survivor(s) may receive the 1957 Survivor benefit if the member dies while actively employed,
has attained at least age 50 for classic and safety PEPRA members and age 52 for miscellaneous PEPRA members,
and has at least 5 years of credited service (total service across all CalPERS employers and with certain other
retirement systems with which CalPERS has reciprocity agreements). A CalPERS member must be actively employed
with the CalPERS employer providing this benefit to be eligible for this benefit. An eligible survivor means the
surviving spouse to whom the member was married at least one year before death or, if there is no eligible spouse,
to the member's unmarried child(ren) under age 18. A member’s survivor who is eligible for any other pre-retirement
death benefit may choose to receive that death benefit instead of this 1957 Survivor benefit.

Benefit

The 1957 Survivor benefit is a monthly allowance equal to one-half of the unmodified service retirement benefit that
the member would have been entitled to receive if the member had retired on the date of his or her death. If the
benefit is payable to the spouse, the benefit is discontinued upon the death of the spouse. If the benefit is payable to
dependent child(ren), the benefit will be discontinued upon death or attainment of age 18, unless the child(ren) is
disabled. The total amount paid will be at least equal to the basic death benefit.

Optional Settlement 2 Death Benefit
This is an optional benefit.

Eligibility

An employee’s eligible survivor may receive the Optional Settlement 2 Death benefit if the member dies while actively
employed, has attained at least age 50 for classic and safety PEPRA members and age 52 for miscellaneous PEPRA
members, and has at least 5 years of credited service (total service across all CalPERS employers and with certain
other retirement systems with which CalPERS has reciprocity agreements). A CalPERS member who is no longer
actively employed with any CalPERS employer is not eligible for this benefit. An eligible survivor means the surviving
spouse to whom the member was married at least one year before death. A member’s survivor who is eligible for any
other pre-retirement death benefit may choose to receive that death benefit instead of this Optional Settlement 2
Death benefit.

Benefit

The Optional Settlement 2 Death benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the service retirement benefit that the
member would have received had the member retired on the date of his or her death and elected 100 percent to
continue to the eligible survivor after the member’s death. The allowance is payable as long as the surviving spouse
lives, at which time it is continued to any unmarried child(ren) under age 18, if applicable. The total amount paid will
be at least equal to the basic death benefit.



Special Death Benefit
This is a standard benefit for safety members. An employer may elect to provide this benefit for miscellaneous
members.

Eligibility

An employee’s eligible survivor(s) may receive the special death benefit if the member dies while actively employed
and the death is job-related. A CalPERS member who is no longer actively employed with any CalPERS employer is
not eligible for this benefit. An eligible survivor means the surviving spouse to whom the member was married prior
to the onset of the injury or illness that resulted in death. If there is no eligible spouse, an eligible survivor means the
member's unmarried child(ren) under age 22. An eligible survivor who chooses to receive this benefit will not receive
any other death benefit.

Benefit

The special death benefit is a monthly allowance equal to 50 percent of final compensation, and will be increased
whenever the compensation paid to active employees is increased but ceasing to increase when the member would
have attained age 50. The allowance is payable to the surviving spouse until death at which time the allowance is
continued to any unmarried child(ren) under age 22. There is a guarantee that the total amount paid will at least
equal the basic death benefit.

If the member’s death is the result of an accident or injury caused by external violence or physical force incurred in
the performance of the member’s duty, and there are eligible surviving child(ren) (eligible means unmarried
child(ren) under age 22) in addition to an eligible spouse, then an additional monthly allowance is paid equal to
the following:

          •   if 1 eligible child:                       12.5 percent of final compensation
          •   if 2 eligible children:                    20.0 percent of final compensation
          •   if 3 or more eligible children:            25.0 percent of final compensation

Alternate Death Benefit for Local Fire Members
This is an optional benefit available only to local fire members.

Eligibility

An employee’s eligible survivor(s) may receive the alternate death benefit in lieu of the basic death benefit or the
1957 Survivor benefit if the member dies while actively employed and has at least 20 years of total CalPERS service.
A CalPERS member who is no longer actively employed with any CalPERS employer is not eligible for this benefit. An
eligible survivor means the surviving spouse to whom the member was married prior to the onset of the injury or
illness that resulted in death. If there is no eligible spouse, an eligible survivor means the member's unmarried
child(ren) under age 18.

Benefit

The Alternate Death benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the service retirement benefit that the member would
have received had the member retired on the date of his or her death and elected Optional Settlement 2. (A retiree
who elects Optional Settlement 2 receives an allowance that has been reduced so that it will continue to be paid after
his or her death to a surviving beneficiary.) If the member has not yet attained age 50, the benefit is equal to that
which would be payable if the member had retired at age 50, based on service credited at the time of death. The
allowance is payable as long as the surviving spouse lives, at which time it is continued to any unmarried child(ren)
under age 18, if applicable. The total amount paid will be at least equal to the basic death benefit.



Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA)
Standard Benefit

Retirement and survivor allowances are adjusted each year in May for cost of living, beginning the second calendar
year after the year of retirement. The standard cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is 2 percent. Annual adjustments
are calculated by first determining the lesser of 1) 2 percent compounded from the end of the year of retirement or
2) actual rate of inflation. The resulting increase is divided by the total increase provided in prior years. For any given
year, the COLA adjustment may be less than 2 percent (when the rate of inflation is low), may be greater than the
rate of inflation (when the rate of inflation is low after several years of high inflation) or may even be greater than 2
percent (when inflation is high after several years of low inflation).

Improved Benefit

Employers have the option of providing a COLA of 3 percent, 4 percent, or 5 percent, determined in the same
manner as described above for the standard 2 percent COLA. An improved COLA is not available with the 1.5% at 65
formula.



Purchasing Power Protection Allowance (PPPA)
Retirement and survivor allowances are protected against inflation by PPPA. PPPA benefits are cost-of-living
adjustments that are intended to maintain an individual’s allowance at 80 percent of the initial allowance at
retirement adjusted for inflation since retirement. The PPPA benefit will be coordinated with other cost-of-living
adjustments provided under the plan.

The employer may choose to “pick-up” these contributions for classic members (Employer Paid Member Contributions
or EPMC). EPMC is prohibited for new PEPRA members.

An employer may also include Employee Cost Sharing in the contract, where employees agree to share the cost of
the employer contribution. These contributions are paid in addition to the member contribution.

Auxiliary organizations of the CSU system may elect reduced contribution rates, in which case the offset is $317 and
the contribution rate is 6 percent if members are not covered by Social Security. If members are covered by Social
Security, the offset is $513 and the contribution rate is 5 percent.



Refund of Employee Contributions
If the member’s service with the employer ends, and if the member does not satisfy the eligibility conditions for any
of the retirement benefits above, the member may elect to receive a refund of his or her employee contributions,
which are credited with 6 percent interest compounded annually.

1959 Survivor Benefit
This is a pre-retirement death benefit available only to members not covered by Social Security. Any agency joining
CalPERS subsequent to 1993 is required to provide this benefit if the members are not covered by Social Security.
The benefit is optional for agencies joining CalPERS prior to 1994. Levels 1, 2 and 3 are now closed. Any new agency
or any agency wishing to add this benefit or increase the current level may only choose the 4th or Indexed Level.

This benefit is not included in the results presented in this valuation. More information on this benefit is available on
the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov.

Counts of members included in the valuation are counts of the records processed by the valuation. Multiple records
may exist for those who have service in more than one valuation group. This does not result in double counting of
liabilities.

Average Annual Benefits represents benefit amounts payable by this plan only. Some members may have service
with another agency and would therefore have a larger total benefit than would be included as part of the average
shown here.

* Counts of members do not include alternate payees receiving benefits while the member is still working. Therefore,
the total counts may not match information on C-1 of the report. Multiple records may exist for those who have
service in more than one coverage group. This does not result in double counting of liabilities.

Normal Cost by Benefit Group
The table below displays the Total Normal Cost broken out by benefit group for Fiscal Year 2019-20. The Total
Normal Cost is the annual cost of service accrual for the fiscal year for active employees and can be viewed as the
long-term contribution rate for the benefits contracted. Generally, the normal cost for a benefit group subject to
more generous benefit provisions will exceed the normal cost for a group with less generous benefits. However,
based on the characteristics of the members (particularly when the number of actives is small), this may not be the
case. Future measurements of the Total Normal Cost for each group may differ significantly from the current values
due to such factors as: changes in the demographics of the group, changes in economic and demographic
assumptions, changes in plan benefits or applicable law.

Note that if a Benefit Group above has multiple bargaining units, each of which has separately contracted for
different benefits such as Employer Paid Member Contributions, then the Normal Cost split does not reflect those
differences. Additionally, if a 2nd Tier Benefit Group amended to the same benefit formula as a 1 st Tier Benefit Group
their Normal Costs may be dissimilar due to demographic or other population differences. In these situations you
should consult with your plan actuary.

  PEPRA Member Contribution Rates
  The table below shows the determination of the PEPRA Member contribution rates based on 50 percent of the Total
  Normal Cost for each respective plan on June 30, 2017. Assembly Bill (AB) 340 created PEPRA that implemented new
  benefit formulas and a final compensation period as well as new contribution requirements for new employees. In
  accordance with Section Code 7522.30(b), “new members … shall have an initial contribution rate of at least 50
  percent of the normal cost rate.” The normal cost for the plan is dependent on the benefit levels, actuarial
  assumptions and demographics of the plan particularly the entry age into the plan. Should the total normal cost of
  the plan change by one percent or more from the base total normal cost established for the plan, the new member
  rate shall be 50 percent of the new normal cost rounded to the nearest quarter percent.

  The PEPRA employee contribution rate determined in the table above may not necessarily be 50 percent of the Total
  Normal Cost by Group based on the PEPRA Normal Cost calculation methodology. Each non-pooled plan is stable with
  a sufficiently large demographic representation of active employees. It is preferable to determine normal cost using a
  large active population ongoing so that this rate remains relatively stable. The total PEPRA normal cost will be
  calculated using all active members within a non-pooled plan until the number of members covered under the PEPRA
  formula meets either:

      1.     50 percent of the active population, or
      2.     25 percent of the active population and 100 or more PEPRA members

  Once either of the conditions above is met for a non-pooled plan, the total PEPRA normal cost will be based on the
  active PEPRA population in the plan.

  Accordingly, the total normal cost will be funded equally between employer and employee based on the
  demographics of the employees of that employer.

Glossary of Actuarial Terms
Accrued Liability (also called Actuarial Accrued Liability or Entry Age Normal Accrued Liability)
    The total dollars needed as of the valuation date to fund all benefits earned in the past for current members.

Actuarial Assumptions
    Assumptions made about certain events that will affect pension costs. Assumptions generally can be broken
    down into two categories: demographic and economic. Demographic assumptions include such things as
    mortality, disability and retirement rates. Economic assumptions include discount rate, salary growth and
    inflation.

Actuarial Methods
    Procedures employed by actuaries to achieve certain funding goals of a pension plan. Actuarial methods include
    funding method, setting the length of time to fund the Accrued Liability and determining the Value of Assets.

Actuarial Valuation
    The determination, as of a valuation date of the Normal Cost, Accrued liability, and related actuarial present
    values for a pension plan. These valuations are performed annually or when an employer is contemplating a
    change to their plan provisions.

Amortization Bases
   Separate payment schedules for different portions of the Unfunded Liability. The total Unfunded Liability of a
   Risk Pool or non-pooled plan can be segregated by "cause,” creating “bases” and each such base will be
   separately amortized and paid for over a specific period of time. However, all bases are amortized using
   investment and payroll assumptions from the current valuation. This can be likened to a home having a first
   mortgage of 24 years remaining payments and a second mortgage that has 10 years remaining payments. Each
   base or each mortgage note has its own terms (payment period, principal, etc.)

    Generally, in an actuarial valuation, the separate bases consist of changes in unfunded liability due to contract
    amendments, actuarial assumption changes, actuarial methodology changes, and/or gains and losses. Payment
    periods are determined by Board policy and vary based on the cause of the change.

Amortization Period
   The number of years required to pay off an Amortization Base.

Classic Member (under PEPRA)
    A classic member is a member who joined CalPERS prior to January 1, 2013 and who is not defined as a new
    member under PEPRA. (See definition of new member below)

Discount Rate Assumption
    The actuarial assumption that was called “investment return” in earlier CalPERS reports or “actuarial interest
    rate” in Section 20014 of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law (PERL).

Entry Age
    The earliest age at which a plan member begins to accrue benefits under a defined benefit pension plan. In
    most cases, this is the age of the member on their date of hire.

Entry Age Normal Cost Method
    An actuarial cost method designed to fund a member's total plan benefit over the course of his or her career.
    This method is designed to yield a rate expressed as a level percentage of payroll.
    (The assumed retirement age less the entry age is the amount of time required to fund a member’s total benefit.
    Generally, the older a member on the date of hire, the greater the entry age normal cost. This is mainly because
    there is less time to earn investment income to fund the future benefits.)

Fresh Start
    A Fresh Start is when multiple amortization bases are collapsed to one base and amortized together over a new
    funding period.

Funded Status
   A measure of how well funded, or how "on track" a plan or risk pool is with respect to assets versus accrued
   liabilities. A ratio greater than 100 percent means the plan or risk pool has more assets than liabilities and a ratio
   less than 100 percent means liabilities are greater than assets.

GASB 68
   Statement No. 68 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The accounting standard governing a state
   or local governmental employer’s accounting and financial reporting for pensions. GASB 68 replaces GASB 27
   effective the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2014.

New Member (under PEPRA)
   A new member includes an individual who becomes a member of a public retirement system for the first time on
   or after January 1, 2013, and who was not a member of another public retirement system prior to that date, and
   who is not subject to reciprocity with another public retirement system.

Normal Cost
   The annual cost of service accrual for the upcoming fiscal year for active employees. The normal cost should be
   viewed as the long-term contribution rate.

Pension Actuary
   A business professional that is authorized by the Society of Actuaries, and the American Academy of Actuaries to
   perform the calculations necessary to properly fund a pension plan.

PEPRA
   The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013

Prepayment Contribution
   A payment made by the employer to reduce or eliminate the year’s required employer contribution towards the
   UAL.

Present Value of Benefits (PVB)
    The total dollars needed as of the valuation date to fund all benefits earned in the past or expected to be earned
    in the future for current members.

Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL)
   When a plan or pool’s Value of Assets is less than its Accrued Liability, the difference is the plan or pool’s
   Unfunded Accrued Liability (or unfunded liability). If the unfunded liability is positive, the plan or pool will have
   to pay contributions exceeding the Normal Cost.

Miscellaneous Plan of the City of Palo Alto (CalPERS ID: 6373437857)
Annual Valuation Report as of June 30, 2017


Dear Employer,

As an attachment to this letter, you will find a copy of the June 30, 2017 actuarial valuation report of your pension
plan. Your 2017 actuarial valuation report contains important actuarial information about your pension plan at CalPERS.
Your CalPERS staff actuary, whose signature appears in the “Actuarial Certification” section on page 1, is available to
discuss the report with you after August 1, 2018.

Required Contributions

The exhibit below displays the minimum required employer contributions and the Employee PEPRA Rate for Fiscal Year
2019-20 along with an estimate of the required contribution for Fiscal Year 2020-21. Member contributions other than
cost sharing (whether paid by the employer or the employee) are in addition to the results shown below. The
required employer contributions in this report do not reflect any cost sharing arrangement you may have
with your employees.

The actual investment return for Fiscal Year 2017-18 was not known at the time this report was prepared. The
projections above assume the investment return for that year would be 7.25 percent. If the actual investment
return for Fiscal Year 2017-18 differs from 7.25 percent, the actual contribution requirements for the
projected years will differ from those shown above.

Moreover, the projected results for Fiscal Year 2020-21 assume that there are no future Plan changes, no further
changes in assumptions other than those recently approved and no liability gains or losses. Such changes can have a
significant impact on required contributions. Since they cannot be predicted in advance, the projected employer results
shown above are estimates. The actual required employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2020-21 will be provided in next
year’s report.

For additional details regarding the assumptions and methods used for these projections please refer to the “Projected
Employer Contributions” in the “Highlights and Executive Summary” section.

The required contributions shown above include a Normal Cost component expressed as a percentage of payroll and a
payment toward Unfunded Accrued Liability expressed as a dollar amount. For illustrative total contribution
requirements expressed as percentages of payroll, please see pages 4 and 5 of the report.

The “Risk Analysis” section of the valuation report starting on page 22 also contains estimated employer contributions
in future years under a variety of investment return scenarios.

Changes since the Prior Year’s Valuation

At its December 2016 meeting, the CalPERS Board of Administration lowered the discount rate from 7.50 percent to
7.00 percent using a three-year phase-in beginning with the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation. The minimum employer
contributions for Fiscal Year 2019-20 determined in this valuation were calculated using a discount rate of 7.25
percent. The projected employer contributions on Page 5 are calculated under the assumption that the discount rate
will be lowered to 7.00 percent next year, as adopted by the Board.

On December 19, 2017, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted new actuarial assumptions based on the
recommendations in the December 2017 CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions. This study
reviewed the retirement rates, termination rates, mortality rates, rates of salary increases and inflation assumption for
Public Agencies. These new assumptions are incorporated in your actuarial valuations and will impact the required
contribution for FY 2019-20. In addition, the Board adopted a new asset portfolio as part of its Asset Liability
Management. The new asset mix supports a 7.00 percent discount rate. The reduction of the inflation assumption will
be implemented in two steps in conjunction with the decreases in the discount rate. For the June 30, 2017 valuation an
inflation rate of 2.625 percent will be used and a rate of 2.50 percent will be used in the following valuation.

The CalPERS Board of Administration has adopted a new amortization policy effective with the June 30, 2019 actuarial
valuation. The new policy shortens the period over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized from 30 years to 20
years with the payments computed using a level dollar amount. In addition, the new policy removes the 5-year ramp-
up and ramp-down on UAL bases attributable to assumption changes and non-investment gains/losses. The new policy
removes the 5-year ramp-down on investment gains/losses. These changes will apply only to new UAL bases
established on or after June 30, 2019.

For inactive employers the new amortization policy imposes a maximum amortization period of 15 years for all
unfunded accrued liabilities effective June 30, 2017. Furthermore, the plan actuary has the ability to shorten the
amortization period on any valuation date based on the life expectancy of plan members and projected cash flow
needs to the plan. The impact of this has been reflected in the current valuation results.

Beginning with Fiscal Year 2017-18 CalPERS began collecting employer contributions toward the plan’s unfunded
liability as dollar amounts instead of the prior method of a contribution rate. This change addressed potential funding
issues that could arise from a declining payroll or reduction in the number of active members in the plan. Funding the
unfunded liability as a percentage of payroll could lead to the underfunding of the plans. Due to stakeholder feedback
regarding internal needs for total contributions expressed as a percentage of payroll, the reports include such results in
the contribution projection on page 5. These results are provided for information purposes only. Contributions toward
the unfunded liability will continue to be collected as dollar amounts.

The CalPERS Board of Administration adopted a Risk Mitigation Policy which is designed to reduce funding risk over
time. This Policy has been temporarily suspended during the period over which the discount rate is being lowered.
More details on the Risk Mitigation Policy can be found on our website.

Besides the above noted changes, there may also be changes specific to the plan such as contract amendments and
funding changes.

Further descriptions of general changes are included in the “Highlights and Executive Summary” section and in
Appendix A, “Actuarial Methods and Assumptions.” The effects of the changes on the required contributions are
included in the “Reconciliation of Required Employer Contributions” section.

We understand that you might have some questions about these results. While we are very interested in discussing
these results with your agency, in the interest of allowing us to give every public agency their results, we ask that you
wait until after August 1, 2018 to contact us with actuarial questions. If you have other questions, you may call the
Customer Contact Center at (888)-CalPERS or (888-225-7377).

Miscellaneous Plan of the City of Palo Alto
CalPERS ID: 6373437857


Introduction
This report presents the results of the June 30, 2017 actuarial valuation of the Miscellaneous Plan of the City
of Palo Alto of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). This actuarial valuation sets
the minimum required employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2019-20.



Purpose of the Report
The actuarial valuation was prepared by the CalPERS Actuarial Office using data as of June 30, 2017. The
purpose of the report is to:

•   Set forth the assets and accrued liabilities of this plan as of June 30, 2017;
•   Determine the minimum required employer contributions for the fiscal year July 1, 2019 through June
    30, 2020;
•   Provide actuarial information as of June 30, 2017 to the CalPERS Board of Administration and other
    interested parties.

The pension funding information presented in this report should not be used in financial reports subject to
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68 for an Agent Employer Defined Benefit
Pension Plan. A separate accounting valuation report for such purposes is available from CalPERS and
details for ordering are available on our website.

The measurements shown in this actuarial valuation may not be applicable for other purposes. The
employer should contact their actuary before disseminating any portion of this report for any reason that is
not explicitly described above.

Future actuarial measurements may differ significantly from the current measurements presented in this
report due to such factors as the following: plan experience differing from that anticipated by the economic
or demographic assumptions; changes in economic or demographic assumptions; changes in actuarial
policies; and changes in plan provisions or applicable law.

 The total minimum required employer contribution is the sum of the Plan’s Employer Normal Cost Rate
 (expressed as a percentage of payroll) plus the Employer Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) Contribution
 Amount (billed monthly in dollars).

 Only the UAL portion of the employer contribution can be prepaid (which must be received in full no
 later than July 31). Plan Normal Cost contributions will be made as part of the payroll reporting
 process. If there is contractual cost sharing or other change, this amount will change.

 In accordance with Sections 20537 and 20572 of the Public Employees’ Retirement Law, if a contracting
 agency fails to remit the required contributions when due, interest and penalties may apply.

 For additional detail regarding the determination of the required contribution for PEPRA members, see
 Appendix D. Required member contributions for Classic members can be found in Appendix B.

    For classic members, this is the percentage specified in the Public Employees Retirement Law, net of any reduction from
    the use of a modified formula or other factors. For PEPRA members, the member contribution rate is based on 50
    percent of the normal cost. A development of PEPRA member contribution rates can be found in Appendix D. Employee
    cost sharing is not shown in this report.

    The Employer Normal Cost is a blended rate for all benefit groups in the plan. A breakout of normal cost by benefit
    group is shown in Appendix D.

    This measure of funded status is an assessment of the need for future employer contributions based on the
    selected actuarial cost method used to fund the plan. The UAL is the present value of future employer
    contributions for service that has already been earned and is in addition to future normal cost contributions
    for active members. For a measure of funded status that is appropriate for assessing the sufficiency of plan
    assets to cover estimated termination liabilities, please see “Hypothetical Termination Liability” in the “Risk
    Analysis” section.



    Projected Employer Contributions
    The table below shows the required and projected employer contributions (before cost sharing) for the next
    six fiscal years. Projected results reflect the adopted changes to the discount rate described in Appendix A,
    “Actuarial Methods and Assumptions.” The projections also assume that all actuarial assumptions will be
    realized and that no further changes to assumptions, contributions, benefits, or funding will occur during the
    projection period. The projected normal cost percentages in the projections below do not reflect that the
    normal cost will decline over time as new employees are hired into PEPRA or other lower cost benefit tiers.

    Changes in the UAL due to actuarial gains or losses as well as changes in actuarial assumptions or methods
    are amortized using a 5-year ramp up. For more information, please see “Amortization of the Unfunded
    Actuarial Accrued Liability” under “Actuarial Methods” in Appendix A. This method phases in the impact of
    changes in UAL over a 5-year period and attempts to minimize employer cost volatility from year to year. As
    a result of this methodology, dramatic changes in the required employer contributions in any one year are
    less likely. However, required contributions can change gradually and significantly over the next five years.
    In years where there is a large increase in UAL the relatively small amortization payments during the ramp
    up period could result in a funded ratio that is projected to decrease initially while the contribution impact of
    the increase in the UAL is phased in.

    Due to the adopted change in the discount rate for the next valuation in combination with the 5-year phase-
    in ramp, the increases in the required contributions are expected to continue for six years from Fiscal Year
    2019-20 through Fiscal Year 2024-25.

    For projected contributions under alternate investment return scenarios, please see the “Analysis of Future
    Investment Return Scenarios” in the “Risk Analysis” section.

Cost
Actuarial Cost Estimates in General

What is the cost of the pension plan?

Contributions to fund the pension plan are comprised of two components:

    •   The Normal Cost, expressed as a percentage of total active payroll.
    •   The Amortization of the Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL), expressed as a dollar amount.

For fiscal years prior to FY 2017-18, the Amortizations of UAL component was expressed as percentage of
total active payroll. Starting with FY 2017-18, the Amortization of UAL component was expressed as a dollar
amount and invoiced on a monthly basis. There continues to be an option to prepay this amount during July
of each fiscal year.

The Normal Cost component will continue to be expressed as a percentage of active payroll with employer
and employee contributions payable as part of the regular payroll reporting process.

The determination of both components requires complex actuarial calculations. The calculations are based
on a set of actuarial assumptions which can be divided into two categories:

    •   Demographic assumptions (which includes mortality rates, retirement rates, employment
        termination rates and disability rates)
    •   Economic assumptions (which includes future investment earnings, inflation, salary growth rates)

These assumptions reflect CalPERS best estimate of the future experience of the plan and are long term in
nature. We recognize that all the assumptions will not be realized in any given year. For example, the
investment earnings at CalPERS have averaged 6.6 percent over the 20 years ending June 30, 2017, yet
individual fiscal year returns have ranged from -24.0 percent to +21.7 percent. In addition, CalPERS reviews
all the actuarial assumptions on an ongoing basis by conducting in-depth experience studies every four
years, with the most recent experience study completed in 2017.




                                                                                                     Page 6

Changes since the Prior Year’s Valuation
Benefits

The standard actuarial practice at CalPERS is to recognize mandated legislative benefit changes in the first
annual valuation following the effective date of the legislation. Voluntary benefit changes by plan amendment
are generally included in the first valuation that is prepared after the amendment becomes effective, even if
the valuation date is prior to the effective date of the amendment.

This valuation generally reflects plan changes by amendments effective before the date of the report. Please
refer to the “Plan’s Major Benefit Options” and Appendix B for a summary of the plan provisions used in this
valuation. The effect of any mandated benefit changes or plan amendments on the unfunded liability is
shown in the “(Gain)/Loss Analysis” and the effect on the employer contribution is shown in the
“Reconciliation of Required Employer Contributions.” It should be noted that no change in liability or
contribution is shown for any plan changes which were already included in the prior year’s valuation.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions

On December 21, 2016, the CalPERS Board of Administration lowered the discount rate from 7.50 percent to
7.00 percent using a three-year phase-in beginning with the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation. The minimum
employer contribution for Fiscal Year 2019-20 determined in this valuation was calculated using a discount
rate of 7.25 percent. The projected employer contributions on Page 5 are calculated assuming that the
discount rate will be lowered to 7.00 percent next year as adopted by the Board. The decision to reduce the
discount rate was primarily based on reduced capital market assumptions provided by external investment
consultants and CalPERS investment staff. The specific decision adopted by the Board reflected
recommendations from CalPERS staff and additional input from employer and employee stakeholder groups.
Based on the investment allocation adopted by the Board and capital market assumptions, the reduced
discount rate assumption provides a more realistic assumption for the long-term investment return of the
fund.

On December 19, 2017, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted new actuarial assumptions based on
the recommendations in the December 2017 CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions.
This study reviewed the retirement rates, termination rates, mortality rates, rates of salary increases and
inflation assumption for Public Agencies. These new assumptions are incorporated in this actuarial valuation
and will impact the required contribution for FY 2019-20. In addition, the Board adopted a new asset
portfolio as part of its Asset Liability Management. The new asset mix supports a 7.00 percent discount rate.
The reduction of the inflation assumption will be implemented in two steps in conjunction with the decreases
in the discount rate. For the June 30, 2017 valuation an inflation rate of 2.625 percent will be used and a rate
of 2.50 percent will be used in the following valuation.

Notwithstanding the Board’s decision to phase into a 7.0 percent discount rate, subsequent analysis of the
expected investment return of CalPERS assets or changes to the investment allocation may result in a change
to this discount rate schedule.



Subsequent Events
The CalPERS Board of Administration has adopted a new amortization policy effective with the June 30, 2019
actuarial valuation. The new policy shortens the period over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized
from 30 years to 20 years with the payments computed using a level dollar amount. In addition, the new
policy removes the 5-year ramp-up and ramp-down on UAL bases attributable to assumption changes and
non-investment gains/losses. The new policy removes the 5-year ramp-down on investment gains/losses.
These changes will apply only to new UAL bases established on or after June 30, 2019.

For inactive employers the new amortization policy imposes a maximum amortization period of 15 years for
all unfunded accrued liabilities effective June 30, 2017. Furthermore, the plan actuary has the ability to
shorten the amortization period on any valuation date based on the life expectancy of plan members and
projected cash flow needs to the plan. The impact of this has been reflected in the current valuation results.

                                                                                                       Page 7

The contribution requirements determined in this actuarial valuation report are based on demographic and
financial information as of June 30, 2017. Changes in the value of assets subsequent to that date are not
reflected. Investment returns below the assumed rate of return will increase the retired contribution, while
investment returns above the assumed rate of return will decrease the retired contribution.

This actuarial valuation report reflects statutory changes, regulatory changes and CalPERS Board actions
through January 2018. Any subsequent changes or actions are not reflected.

Asset Allocation
CalPERS adheres to an Asset Allocation Strategy which establishes asset class allocation policy targets and
ranges, and manages those asset class allocations within their policy ranges. CalPERS Investment Belief No.
6 recognizes that strategic asset allocation is the dominant determinant of portfolio risk and return. On
December 19, 2017, the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted changes to the current asset allocation as
shown in the Policy Target Allocation below expressed as a percentage of total assets.

The asset allocation and market value of assets shown below reflect the values of the Public Employees’
Retirement Fund (PERF) in its entirety as of June 30, 2017. The assets for City of Palo Alto Miscellaneous
Plan are part of the PERF and are invested accordingly.

The table below shows historical geometric mean annual returns of the Public Employees Retirement Fund
for various time periods ending on June 30, 2017 (figures are reported as gross of fees). The geometric
mean rate of return is the average rate per period compounded over multiple periods. It should be
recognized that in any given year the rate of return is volatile. The portfolio has an expected volatility of
11.4 percent per year based on the most recent Asset Liability Modelling study. The volatility is a measure of
the risk of the portfolio expressed in the standard deviation of the fund’s total return distribution, expressed
as a percentage. Consequently, when looking at investment returns, it is more instructive to look at returns
over longer time horizons.

(Gain)/Loss Analysis 6/30/16 – 6/30/17
To calculate the cost requirements of the plan, assumptions are made about future events that affect the
amount and timing of benefits to be paid and assets to be accumulated. Each year, actual experience is
compared to the expected experience based on the actuarial assumptions. This results in actuarial gains or

     Schedule of Amortization Bases
     There is a two-year lag between the valuation date and the start of the contribution fiscal year.
     •   The assets, liabilities, and funded status of the plan are measured as of the valuation date: June 30, 2017.
     •   The required employer contributions determined by the valuation are for the fiscal year beginning two years after the valuation date: Fiscal Year 2019-20.

     This two-year lag is necessary due to the amount of time needed to extract and test the membership and financial data, and the need to provide public agencies
     with their required employer contribution well in advance of the start of the fiscal year.

     The Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) is used to determine the employer contribution and therefore must be rolled forward two years from the valuation date to the
     first day of the fiscal year for which the contribution is being determined. The UAL is rolled forward each year by subtracting the expected payment on the UAL for the
     fiscal year and adjusting for interest. The expected payment on the UAL for a fiscal year is equal to the Expected Employer Contribution for the fiscal year minus the
     Expected Normal Cost for the year. The Employer Contribution for the first fiscal year is determined by the actuarial valuation two years ago and the contribution for
     the second year is from the actuarial valuation one year ago. Additional discretionary payments are reflected in the Expected Payments column in the fiscal year they
     were made by the agency.

Miscellaneous Plan of the City of Palo Alto
CalPERS ID: 6373437857


Amortization Schedule and Alternatives
The amortization schedule on the previous page shows the minimum contributions required according to
CalPERS amortization policy. There has been considerable interest from many agencies in paying off these
unfunded accrued liabilities sooner and the possible savings in doing so. As a result, we have provided
alternate amortization schedules to help analyze the current amortization schedule and illustrate the
advantages of accelerating unfunded liability payments.

Shown on the following page are future year amortization payments based on 1) the current amortization
schedule reflecting the individual bases and remaining periods shown on the previous page, and 2) alternate
“fresh start” amortization schedules using two sample periods that would both result in interest savings
relative to the current amortization schedule. Note that the payments under each alternate scenario
increase by 2.875 percent per year. The schedules do not reflect the impact of adopted discount
rate changes that will become effective beyond June 30, 2017. Therefore, future amortization
payments displayed in the Current Amortization Schedule on the following page will not match
projected amortization payments shown in connection with Projected Employer Contributions
provided elsewhere in this report.

The Current Amortization Schedule typically contains individual bases that are both positive and negative.
Positive bases result from plan changes, assumption changes or plan experience that result in increases to
unfunded liability. Negative bases result from plan changes, assumption changes or plan experience that
result in decreases to unfunded liability. The combination of positive and negative bases within an
amortization schedule can result in unusual or problematic circumstances in future years such as:

    •    A positive total unfunded liability with a negative total payment,
    •    A negative total unfunded liability with a positive total payment, or
    •    Total payments that completely amortize the unfunded liability over a very short period of time

In any year where one of the above scenarios occurs, the actuary will consider corrective action such as
replacing the existing unfunded liability bases with a single “fresh start” base and amortizing it over a
reasonable period.

The Current Amortization Schedule on the following page may appear to show that, based on the current
amortization bases, one of the above scenarios will occur at some point in the future. It is impossible to
know today whether such a scenario will in fact arise since there will be additional bases added to the
amortization schedule in each future year. Should such a scenario arise in any future year, the actuary will
take appropriate action based on guidelines in the CalPERS amortization policy.

Analysis of Future Investment Return Scenarios
Analysis was performed to determine the effects of various future investment returns on required employer
contributions. The projections below provide a range of results based on five investment return scenarios
assumed to occur during the next four fiscal years (2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21). The
projections also assume that all other actuarial assumptions will be realized and that no further changes to
assumptions, contributions, benefits, or funding will occur.

Each of the five investment return scenarios assumes a return of 7.25 percent for fiscal year 2017-18. For
fiscal years 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 each scenario assumes an alternate fixed annual return. The
fixed return assumptions for the five scenarios are 1.0 percent, 4.0 percent, 7.0 percent, 9.0 percent and
12.0 percent.

The alternate investment returns were chosen based on stochastic analysis of possible future investment
returns over the four-year period ending June 30, 2021. Using the expected returns and volatility of the
asset classes in which the funds are invested, we produced five thousand stochastic outcomes for this
period based on the recently completed Asset Liability Management process. We then selected annual
returns that approximate the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles for these outcomes. For example, of
all the 4-year outcomes generated in the stochastic analysis, approximately 25 percent of them had an
average annual return of 4.0 percent or less.

Required contributions outside of this range are also possible. In particular, whereas it is unlikely that
investment returns will average less than 1.0 percent or greater than 12.0 percent over this four-year
period, the possibility of a single investment return less than 1.0 percent or greater than 12.0 percent in any
given year is much greater.

Given the temporary suspension of the Risk Mitigation Policy during the period over which the discount rate
assumption is being phased down to 7.0 percent, the projections above were performed without reflection
of any possible impact of this Policy for Fiscal Year 2020-21.

The projected normal cost percentages do not reflect that the normal cost will decline over time as new
employees are hired into PEPRA or other lower cost benefit tiers. In addition, the projections above do not
reflect the recent changes to the amortization policy effective with the June 30, 2019 valuation but the
impact on the results above is expected to be minimal.

Analysis of Discount Rate Sensitivity
Shown below are various valuation results as of June 30, 2017 assuming alternate discount rates. Results
are shown using the current discount rate of 7.25 percent as well as alternate discount rates of 6.0 percent,
7.0 percent, and 8.0 percent. The alternate rate of 7.0 percent was selected since the Board has adopted
this rate as the final discount rate at the end of the three-year phase-in of the reduction in this assumption.
The rates of 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent were selected since they illustrate the impact of a 1 percent
increase or decrease to the 7.0 percent assumption. This analysis shows the potential plan impacts if the
PERF were to realize investment returns of 6.0 percent, 7.0 percent, or 8.0 percent over the long-term.

This type of analysis gives the reader a sense of the long-term risk to required contributions. For a measure
of funded status that is appropriate for assessing the sufficiency of plan assets to cover estimated
termination liabilities, please see “Hypothetical Termination Liability” at the end of this section.

Volatility Ratios
The actuarial calculations supplied in this communication are based on various assumptions about long-term
demographic and economic behavior. Unless these assumptions (terminations, deaths, disabilities,
retirements, salary growth, and investment return) are exactly realized each year, there will be differences
on a year-to-year basis. The year-to-year differences between actual experience and the assumptions are
called actuarial gains and losses and serve to lower or raise required employer contributions from one year
to the next. Therefore, employer contributions will inevitably fluctuate, especially due to the ups and downs
of investment returns.

Asset Volatility Ratio (AVR)

Plans that have higher asset-to-payroll ratios experience more volatile employer contributions (as a
percentage of payroll) due to investment return. For example, a plan with an asset-to-payroll ratio of 8 may
experience twice the contribution volatility due to investment return volatility than a plan with an asset-to-
payroll ratio of 4. Shown below is the asset volatility ratio, a measure of the plan’s current volatility. It
should be noted that this ratio is a measure of the current situation. It increases over time but generally
tends to stabilize as the plan matures.

Liability Volatility Ratio (LVR)

Plans that have higher liability-to-payroll ratios experience more volatile employer contributions (as a
percentage of payroll) due to investment return and changes in liability. For example, a plan with a liability-
to-payroll ratio of 8 is expected to have twice the contribution volatility of a plan with a liability-to-payroll
ratio of 4. The liability volatility ratio is also included in the table below. It should be noted that this ratio
indicates a longer-term potential for contribution volatility. The asset volatility ratio, described above, will
tend to move closer to the liability volatility ratio as the plan matures. Since the liability volatility ratio is a
long-term measure, it is shown below at the current discount rate (7.25 percent) as well as the discount
rate the Board has adopted to determine the contribution requirement in the June 30, 2018 actuarial
valuation (7.00 percent).

   Hypothetical Termination Liability
   The hypothetical termination liability is an estimate of the financial position of the plan had the contract with
   CalPERS been terminated as of June 30, 2017. The plan liability on a termination basis is calculated
   differently from the plan’s ongoing funding liability. For this hypothetical termination liability calculation,
   both compensation and service are frozen as of the valuation date and no future pay increases or service
   accruals are assumed. This measure of funded status is not appropriate for assessing the need for future
   employer contributions in the case of an ongoing plan, that is, for an employer that continues to provide
   CalPERS retirement benefits to active employees.

   A more conservative investment policy and asset allocation strategy was adopted by the CalPERS Board for
   the Terminated Agency Pool. The Terminated Agency Pool has limited funding sources since no future
   employer contributions will be made. Therefore, expected benefit payments are secured by risk-free assets
   and benefit security for members is increased while limiting the funding risk. However, this asset allocation
   has a lower expected rate of return than the PERF and consequently, a lower discount rate assumption. The
   lower discount rate for the Terminated Agency Pool results in higher liabilities for terminated plans.

   The effective termination discount rate will depend on actual market rates of return for risk-free securities
   on the date of termination. As market discount rates are variable the table below shows a range for the
   hypothetical termination liability based on the lowest and highest interest rates observed during an
   approximate 2-year period centered around the valuation date.

       The hypothetical liabilities calculated above include a 5 percent contingency load in accordance with Board policy.
       Other actuarial assumptions can be found in Appendix A.
   2
       The current discount rate assumption used for termination valuations is a weighted average of the 10-year and 30-year
       U.S. Treasury yields where the weights are based on matching asset and liability durations as of the termination date.
       The discount rates used in the table are based on 20-year Treasury bonds, rounded to the nearest quarter percentage
       point, which is a good proxy for most plans. The 20-year Treasury yield was 2.61 percent on June 30, 2017, and was
       2.83 percent on January 31, 2018.

   In order to terminate the plan, you must first contact our Retirement Services Contract Unit to initiate a
   Resolution of Intent to Terminate. The completed Resolution will allow the plan actuary to give you a
   preliminary termination valuation with a more up-to-date estimate of the plan liabilities. CalPERS advises
   you to consult with the plan actuary before beginning this process.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions



Actuarial Data
As stated in the Actuarial Certification, the data which serves as the basis of this valuation has been
obtained from the various CalPERS databases. We have reviewed the valuation data and believe that it is
reasonable and appropriate in aggregate. We are unaware of any potential data issues that would have a
material effect on the results of this valuation, except that data does not always contain the latest salary
information for former members now in reciprocal systems and does not recognize the potential for
unusually large salary deviation in certain cases such as elected officials. Therefore, salary information in
these cases may not be accurate. These situations are relatively infrequent, however, and when they do
occur, they generally do not have a material impact on the required employer contributions.



Actuarial Methods
Actuarial Cost Method

The actuarial cost method used is the Entry Age Normal Cost Method. Under this method, projected benefits
are determined for all members and the associated liabilities are spread in a manner that produces level
annual cost as a percentage of pay in each year from the member’s entry age to their assumed retirement
age on the valuation date. The cost allocated to the current fiscal year is called the normal cost.

The actuarial accrued liability for active members is then calculated as the portion of the total cost of the
plan allocated to prior years. The actuarial accrued liability for members currently receiving benefits and for
members entitled to deferred benefits is equal to the present value of the benefits expected to be paid. No
normal costs are applicable for these participants.


Amortization of Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability

The excess of the total actuarial accrued liability over the market value of plan assets is called the unfunded
actuarial accrued liability (UAL). Funding requirements are determined by adding the normal cost and an
amortization payment toward the unfunded liability. The unfunded liability is amortized as a “level percent
of pay”. Commencing with the June 30, 2013 valuation, all new gains or losses are amortized over a fixed
30-year period with a 5-year ramp up at the beginning and a 5-year ramp down at the end of the
amortization period. All changes in liability due to plan amendments (other than golden handshakes) are
amortized over a 20-year period with no ramp. Changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in actuarial
methodology are amortized over a 20-year period with a 5-year ramp up at the beginning and a 5-year
ramp down at the end of the amortization period. Changes in unfunded accrued liability due to a Golden
Handshake will be amortized over a period of five years. A summary of the current policy is provided in the
table below:

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions


The 5-year ramp up means that the payments in the first four years of the amortization period are 20
percent, 40 percent, 60 percent and 80 percent of the “full” payment which begins in year five. The 5-year
ramp down means that the reverse is true in the final four years of the amortization period.

Exceptions for Inconsistencies:

An exception to the amortization rules above is used whenever their application results in inconsistencies. In
these cases, a “fresh start” approach is used. This means that the current unfunded actuarial liability is
projected and amortized over a set number of years. For example, a fresh start is needed in the following
situations:

    •    When a positive payment would be required on a negative unfunded actuarial liability (or
         conversely a negative payment on a positive unfunded actuarial liability); or
    •    When there are excess assets, rather than an unfunded liability. In this situation, a 30-year fresh
         start is used.

It should be noted that the actuary may determine that a fresh start is necessary under other
circumstances. In all cases of a fresh start, the period is set by the actuary at what is deemed appropriate;
however, the period will not be greater than 30 years.


Exceptions for Inactive Plans:

The following exceptions apply to plans classified as Inactive. These plans have no active members and no
expectation to have active members in the future.

    •    Amortization of the unfunded liability is on a “level dollar” basis rather than a “level percent of pay”
         basis. For amortization layers, which utilize a ramp up and ramp down, the “ultimate” payment is
         constant.
    •    Actuarial judgment will be used to shorten amortization periods for Inactive plans with existing
         periods that are deemed too long given the duration of the liability. The specific demographics of
         the plan will be used to determine if shorter periods may be more appropriate.


Asset Valuation Method

It is the policy of the CalPERS Board of Administration to use professionally accepted amortization methods
to eliminate a surplus or an unfunded accrued liability in a manner that maintains benefit security for the
members of the System while minimizing substantial variations in required employer contributions. On April
17, 2013, the CalPERS Board of Administration approved a recommendation to change the CalPERS
amortization and rate smoothing policies. Beginning with the June 30, 2013 valuations that set the employer
contribution for Fiscal Year 2015-16, CalPERS employs a policy that amortizes all gains and losses over a
fixed 30-year period. The increase or decrease in the rate is then spread directly over a 5-year period. This
method is referred to as “direct rate smoothing.” CalPERS no longer uses an actuarial value of assets and
only uses the market value of assets. The direct rate smoothing method is equivalent to a method using a
5-year asset smoothing period with no actuarial value of asset corridor and a 25-year amortization period
for gains and losses.


PEPRA Normal Cost Rate Methodology

Per Government Code Section 7522.30(b) the “normal cost rate” shall mean the annual actuarially
determined normal cost for the plan of retirement benefits provided to the new member and shall be
established based on actuarial assumptions used to determine the liabilities and costs as part of the annual
actuarial valuation. The plan of retirement benefits shall include any elements that would impact the
actuarial determination of the normal cost, including, but not limited to, the retirement formula, eligibility
and vesting criteria, ancillary benefit provisions, and any automatic cost-of-living adjustments as determined
by the public retirement system.




                                                                                                             A-2

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions


Each non-pooled plan is stable with a sufficiently large demographic representation of active employees. It
is preferable to determine normal cost using a large active population ongoing so that this rate remains
relatively stable. The total PEPRA normal cost will be calculated using all active members within a non-
pooled plan until the number of members covered under the PEPRA formula meets either:

    1.   50 percent of the active population, or
    2.   25 percent of the active population and 100 or more PEPRA members

Once either of the conditions above is met for a non-pooled plan, the total PEPRA normal cost will be based
on the active PEPRA population in the plan.

Accordingly, the total normal cost will be funded equally between employer and employee based on the
demographics of the employees of that employer.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions



Actuarial Assumptions
In 2017, CalPERS completed its most recent asset liability management study incorporating actuarial
assumptions and strategic asset allocation. In December 2017, the CalPERS Board of Administration
adopted relatively modest changes to the asset allocation that reduced the expected volatility of returns.
The adopted asset allocation was expected to have a long-term blended return that continued to support a
discount rate assumption of 7.00 percent. The Board also approved several changes to the demographic
assumptions that more closely aligned with actual experience. These new actuarial assumptions were first
used in this, the June 30, 2017 valuation to set the Fiscal Year 2019-20 contribution for public agency
employers.

On December 21, 2016, the CalPERS Board of Administration lowered the discount rate from 7.50 percent to
7.00 percent using a three-year phase-in beginning with the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuations. The
minimum employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2019-20 determined in this valuation were calculated using
a discount rate of 7.25 percent. The projected employer contributions on Page 5 are calculated assuming
that the discount rate will be lowered to 7.00 percent next year as adopted by the Board. The decision to
reduce the discount rate was primarily based on reduced capital market assumptions provided by external
investment consultants and CalPERS investment staff. The specific decision adopted by the Board reflected
recommendations from CalPERS staff and additional input from employer and employee stakeholder groups.
Based on the investment allocation adopted by the Board and capital market assumptions, the reduced
discount rate schedule provides a more realistic assumption for the long-term investment return of the fund.

Notwithstanding the Board’s decision to phase into a 7.0 percent discount rate, subsequent analysis of the
expected investment return of CalPERS assets or changes to the investment allocation may result in a
change to this discount rate schedule.

For more details and additional rationale for the selection of the actuarial assumptions, please refer to the
CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions report from December 2017 that can be
found on the CalPERS website under: “Forms and Publications”. Click on “View All” and search for
Experience Study.

All actuarial assumptions (except the discount rates used for the hypothetical termination liability) represent
an estimate of future experience rather than observations of the estimates inherent in market data.

Economic Assumptions

    Discount Rate
        The prescribed discount rate assumption adopted by the Board on December 21, 2016 is 7.25
        percent compounded annually (net of investment and administrative expenses) as of 6/30/2017.

         The Board also prescribed that the assumed discount rate will reduce to 7.0 percent compounded
         annually (net of expenses) as of 6/30/2018. This change to the discount rate assumption is not
         reflected in the determination of required contributions determined in this report for Fiscal Year
         2019-20.

    Termination Liability Discount Rate
       The current discount rate assumption used for termination valuations is a weighted average of the
       10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields where the weights are based on matching asset and
       liability durations as of the termination date.

         The hypothetical termination liabilities in this report are calculated using an observed range of
         market interest rates. This range is based on the lowest and highest 20-year Treasury bond
         observed during an approximate 2-year period centered around the valuation date. The 20-year
         Treasury bond has a similar duration to most plan liabilities and serves as a good proxy for the
         termination discount rate. The 20-year Treasury yield was 2.61 percent on June 30, 2017.

        •    The Miscellaneous salary scale is used for Local Prosecutors.
        •    The Police salary scale is used for Other Safety, Local Sheriff, and School Police.

    Overall Payroll Growth
       2.875 percent compounded annually (used in projecting the payroll over which the unfunded
       liability is amortized). This assumption is used for all plans with active members. For the June 30,
       2018 valuation the payroll growth assumption will be 2.75 percent.

    Inflation
        2.625 percent compounded annually. For the June 30, 2018 valuation the inflation assumption will
        be 2.50 percent.

    Non-valued Potential Additional Liabilities
       The potential liability loss for a cost-of-living increase exceeding the 2.625 percent inflation
       assumption, and any potential liability loss from future member service purchases are not reflected
       in the valuation.

Miscellaneous Loading Factors

    Credit for Unused Sick Leave
       Total years of service is increased by 1 percent for those plans that have adopted the provision of
       providing Credit for Unused Sick Leave.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions


    Conversion of Employer Paid Member Contributions (EPMC)
       Total years of service is increased by the Employee Contribution Rate for those plans with the
       provision providing for the Conversion of Employer Paid Member Contributions (EPMC) during the
       final compensation period.

    Norris Decision (Best Factors)
       Employees hired prior to July 1, 1982 have projected benefit amounts increased in order to reflect
       the use of “Best Factors” in the calculation of optional benefit forms. This is due to a 1983
       Supreme Court decision, known as the Norris decision, which required males and females to be
       treated equally in the determination of benefit amounts. Consequently, anyone already employed
       at that time is given the best possible conversion factor when optional benefits are determined. No
       loading is necessary for employees hired after July 1, 1982.

   Termination Liability
       The termination liabilities include a 5 percent contingency load. This load is for unforeseen negative
       experience.

Demographic Assumptions

    Pre-Retirement Mortality
        Non-industrial death rates vary by age and gender. Industrial death rates vary by age. See sample
        rates in table below. The non-industrial death rates are used for all plans. The industrial death
        rates are used for safety plans (except for Local Prosecutor safety members where the
        corresponding miscellaneous plan does not have the Industrial Death Benefit).

       Miscellaneous plans usually have industrial death rates set to zero unless the agency has specifically
       contracted for industrial death benefits. If so, each non-industrial death rate shown above will be
       split into two components; 99 percent will become the non-industrial death rate and 1 percent will
       become the industrial death rate.

    Age of Spouse
       It is assumed that female spouses are 3 years younger than male spouses. This assumption is used
       for all plans.

    Terminated Members
       It is assumed that terminated members refund immediately if non-vested. Terminated members
       who are vested are assumed to retire at age 59 for Miscellaneous members and age 54 for safety
       members.

    Termination with Refund
       Rates vary by entry age and service for miscellaneous plans. Rates vary by service for safety plans.

Internal Revenue Code Section 415

The limitations on benefits imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 415 are taken into account in this
valuation. Each year the impact of any changes in this limitation since the prior valuation is included and
amortized as part of the actuarial gain or loss base. This results in lower contributions for those employers
contributing to the Replacement Benefit Fund and protects CalPERS from prefunding expected benefits in
excess of limits imposed by federal tax law.

Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) (17)

The limitations on compensation imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) (17) are taken into
account in this valuation. Each year, the impact of any changes in the compensation limitation since the
prior valuation is included and amortized as part of the actuarial gain or loss base. The compensation limit
for classic members for the 2017 calendar year is $270,000.

Miscellaneous Plan of the City of Palo Alto
Principal Plan Provisions


The following is a description of the principal plan provisions used in calculating costs and liabilities. We have
indicated whether a plan provision is standard or optional. Standard benefits are applicable to all members while
optional benefits vary among employers. Optional benefits that apply to a single period of time, such as Golden
Handshakes, have not been included. Many of the statements in this summary are general in nature, and are
intended to provide an easily understood summary of the Public Employees’ Retirement Law. The law itself governs
in all situations.



Service Retirement
Eligibility

A classic CalPERS member or PEPRA Safety member becomes eligible for Service Retirement upon attainment of age
50 with at least 5 years of credited service (total service across all CalPERS employers, and with certain other
retirement systems with which CalPERS has reciprocity agreements). For employees hired into a plan with the 1.5
percent at 65 formula, eligibility for service retirement is age 55 with at least 5 years of service. PEPRA miscellaneous
members become eligible for service retirement upon attainment of age 52 with at least 5 years of service.

Benefit

The service retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the product of the benefit factor, years of service, and
final compensation.

•     The benefit factor depends on the benefit formula specified in your agency’s contract. The table below shows
      the factors for each of the available formulas. Factors vary by the member’s age at retirement. Listed are the
      factors for retirement at whole year ages:

of 35 or greater. If entry age is less than 35, then the age 55 benefit factor is 50 percent divided by the difference
between age 55 and entry age. The benefit factor for ages prior to age 55 is the same proportion of the age 55
benefit factor as in the above table.

•   The years of service is the amount credited by CalPERS to a member while he or she is employed in this group
    (or for other periods that are recognized under the employer’s contract with CalPERS). For a member who has
    earned service with multiple CalPERS employers, the benefit from each employer is calculated separately
    according to each employer’s contract, and then added together for the total allowance. An agency may contract
    for an optional benefit where any unused sick leave accumulated at the time of retirement will be converted to
    credited service at a rate of 0.004 years of service for each day of sick leave.

•   The final compensation is the monthly average of the member’s highest 36 or 12 consecutive months’ full-time
    equivalent monthly pay (no matter which CalPERS employer paid this compensation). The standard benefit is 36
    months. Employers had the option of providing a final compensation equal to the highest 12 consecutive months
    for classic plans only. Final compensation must be defined by the highest 36 consecutive months’ pay under the
    1.5% at 65 formula. PEPRA members have a cap on the annual salary that can be used to calculate final
    compensation for all new members based on the Social Security contribution and benefit base. For employees
    that participate in Social Security this cap is $118,775 for 2017 and for those employees that do not participate
    in Social Security the cap for 2017 is $142,530. Adjustments to the caps are permitted annually based on
    changes to the CPI for all urban consumers.

•   Employees must be covered by Social Security with the 1.5% at 65 formula. Social Security is optional for all
    other benefit formulas. For employees covered by Social Security, the modified formula is the standard benefit.
    Under this type of formula, the final compensation is offset by $133.33 (or by one third if the final compensation
    is less than $400). Employers may contract for the full benefit with Social Security that will eliminate the offset
    applicable to the final compensation. For employees not covered by Social Security, the full benefit is paid with

    no offsets. Auxiliary organizations of the CSUC system may elect reduced contribution rates, in which case the
    offset is $317 if members are not covered by Social Security or $513 if members are covered by Social Security.

    retirement benefit is capped at 90 percent of final compensation.



Vested Deferred Retirement
Eligibility for Deferred Status

A CalPERS member becomes eligible for a deferred vested retirement benefit when he or she leaves employment,
keeps his or her contribution account balance on deposit with CalPERS, and has earned at least 5 years of credited
service (total service across all CalPERS employers, and with certain other retirement systems with which CalPERS
has reciprocity agreements).

Eligibility to Start Receiving Benefits

The CalPERS classic members and PEPRA safety members become eligible to receive the deferred retirement benefit
upon satisfying the eligibility requirements for deferred status and upon attainment of age 50 (55 for employees
hired into a 1.5% @ 65 plan). PEPRA miscellaneous members become eligible to receive the deferred retirement
benefit upon satisfying the eligibility requirements for deferred status and upon attainment of age 52.

Benefit

The vested deferred retirement benefit is the same as the service retirement benefit, where the benefit factor is
based on the member’s age at allowance commencement. For members who have earned service with multiple
CalPERS employers, the benefit from each employer is calculated separately according to each employer’s contract,
and then added together for the total allowance.



Non-Industrial (Non-Job Related) Disability Retirement
Eligibility

A CalPERS member is eligible for Non-Industrial Disability Retirement if he or she becomes disabled and has at least
5 years of credited service (total service across all CalPERS employers, and with certain other retirement systems
with which CalPERS has reciprocity agreements). There is no special age requirement. Disabled means the member is
unable to perform his or her job because of an illness or injury, which is expected to be permanent or to last
indefinitely. The illness or injury does not have to be job related. A CalPERS member must be actively employed by
any CalPERS employer at the time of disability in order to be eligible for this benefit.

Standard Benefit

The standard Non-Industrial Disability Retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to 1.8 percent of final
compensation, multiplied by service, which is determined as follows:

•   Service is CalPERS credited service, for members with less than 10 years of service or greater than 18.518 years
    of service; or

•   Service is CalPERS credited service plus the additional number of years that the member would have worked
    until age 60, for members with at least 10 years but not more than 18.518 years of service. The maximum
    benefit in this case is 33 1/3 percent of final compensation.




                                                                                                                B-3

Improved Benefit

Employers have the option of providing the improved Non-Industrial Disability Retirement benefit. This benefit
provides a monthly allowance equal to 30 percent of final compensation for the first 5 years of service, plus 1 percent
for each additional year of service to a maximum of 50 percent of final compensation.

Members who are eligible for a larger service retirement benefit may choose to receive that benefit in lieu of a
disability benefit. Members eligible to retire, and who have attained the normal retirement age determined by their
service retirement benefit formula, will receive the same dollar amount for disability retirement as that payable for
service retirement. For members who have earned service with multiple CalPERS employers, the benefit attributed to
each employer is the total disability allowance multiplied by the ratio of service with a particular employer to the total
CalPERS service.



Industrial (Job Related) Disability Retirement
All safety members have this benefit. For miscellaneous members, employers have the option of providing this
benefit. An employer may choose to provide the increased benefit option or the improved benefit option.

Eligibility

An employee is eligible for Industrial Disability Retirement if he or she becomes disabled while working, where
disabled means the member is unable to perform the duties of the job because of a work-related illness or injury,
which is expected to be permanent or to last indefinitely. A CalPERS member who has left active employment within
this group is not eligible for this benefit, except to the extent described below.

Standard Benefit

The standard Industrial Disability Retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to 50 percent of final
compensation.

Increased Benefit (75 percent of Final Compensation)

The increased Industrial Disability Retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to 75 percent final compensation
for total disability.

Improved Benefit (50 percent to 90 percent of Final Compensation)

The improved Industrial Disability Retirement benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the Workman’s Compensation
Appeals Board permanent disability rate percentage (if 50 percent or greater, with a maximum of 90 percent) times
the final compensation.

For a CalPERS member not actively employed in this group who became disabled while employed by some other
CalPERS employer, the benefit is a return of accumulated member contributions with respect to employment in this
group. With the standard or increased benefit, a member may also choose to receive the annuitization of the
accumulated member contributions.

If a member is eligible for service retirement and if the service retirement benefit is more than the industrial disability
retirement benefit, the member may choose to receive the larger benefit.

Post-Retirement Death Benefit
Standard Lump Sum Payment

Upon the death of a retiree, a one-time lump sum payment of $500 will be made to the retiree’s designated
survivor(s), or to the retiree’s estate.

Improved Lump Sum Payment

Employers have the option of providing an improved lump sum death benefit of $600, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 or
$5,000.



Form of Payment for Retirement Allowance
Standard Form of Payment

Generally, the retirement allowance is paid to the retiree in the form of an annuity for as long as he or she is alive.
The retiree may choose to provide for a portion of his or her allowance to be paid to any designated beneficiary after
the retiree’s death. CalPERS provides for a variety of such benefit options, which the retiree pays for by taking a
reduction in his or her retirement allowance. Such reduction takes into account the amount to be provided to the
beneficiary and the probable duration of payments (based on the ages of the member and beneficiary) made
subsequent to the member’s death.

Improved Form of Payment (Post-Retirement Survivor Allowance)

Employers have the option to contract for the post-retirement survivor allowance.

For retirement allowances with respect to service subject to the modified formula, 25 percent of the retirement
allowance will automatically be continued to certain statutory beneficiaries upon the death of the retiree, without a
reduction in the retiree’s allowance. For retirement allowances with respect to service subject to the full or
supplemental formula, 50 percent of the retirement allowance will automatically be continued to certain statutory
beneficiaries upon the death of the retiree, without a reduction in the retiree’s allowance. This additional benefit is
referred to as post-retirement survivor allowance (PRSA) or simply as survivor continuance.

In other words, 25 percent or 50 percent of the allowance, the continuance portion, is paid to the retiree for as long
as he or she is alive, and that same amount is continued to the retiree’s spouse (or if no eligible spouse, to
unmarried child(ren) until they attain age 18; or, if no eligible child(ren), to a qualifying dependent parent) for the
rest of his or her lifetime. This benefit will not be discontinued in the event the spouse remarries.

The remaining 75 percent or 50 percent of the retirement allowance, which may be referred to as the option portion
of the benefit, is paid to the retiree as an annuity for as long as he or she is alive. Or, the retiree may choose to
provide for some of this option portion to be paid to any designated beneficiary after the retiree’s death. Benefit
options applicable to the option portion are the same as those offered with the standard form. The reduction is
calculated in the same manner but is applied only to the option portion.

Pre-Retirement Death Benefits

Basic Death Benefit
This is a standard benefit.

Eligibility

An employee’s beneficiary (or estate) may receive the basic death benefit if the member dies while actively
employed. A CalPERS member must be actively employed with the CalPERS employer providing this benefit to be
eligible for this benefit. A member’s survivor who is eligible for any other pre-retirement death benefit may choose to
receive that death benefit instead of this basic death benefit.

Benefit

The basic death benefit is a lump sum in the amount of the member’s accumulated contributions, where interest is
currently credited at 7.5 percent per year, plus a lump sum in the amount of one month's salary for each completed
year of current service, up to a maximum of six months' salary. For purposes of this benefit, one month's salary is
defined as the member's average monthly full-time rate of compensation during the 12 months preceding death.



1957 Survivor Benefit
This is a standard benefit.

Eligibility

An employee’s eligible survivor(s) may receive the 1957 Survivor benefit if the member dies while actively employed,
has attained at least age 50 for classic and safety PEPRA members and age 52 for miscellaneous PEPRA members,
and has at least 5 years of credited service (total service across all CalPERS employers and with certain other
retirement systems with which CalPERS has reciprocity agreements). A CalPERS member must be actively employed
with the CalPERS employer providing this benefit to be eligible for this benefit. An eligible survivor means the
surviving spouse to whom the member was married at least one year before death or, if there is no eligible spouse,
to the member's unmarried child(ren) under age 18. A member’s survivor who is eligible for any other pre-retirement
death benefit may choose to receive that death benefit instead of this 1957 Survivor benefit.

Benefit

The 1957 Survivor benefit is a monthly allowance equal to one-half of the unmodified service retirement benefit that
the member would have been entitled to receive if the member had retired on the date of his or her death. If the
benefit is payable to the spouse, the benefit is discontinued upon the death of the spouse. If the benefit is payable to
dependent child(ren), the benefit will be discontinued upon death or attainment of age 18, unless the child(ren) is
disabled. The total amount paid will be at least equal to the basic death benefit.

Optional Settlement 2 Death Benefit
This is an optional benefit.

Eligibility

An employee’s eligible survivor may receive the Optional Settlement 2 Death benefit if the member dies while actively
employed, has attained at least age 50 for classic and safety PEPRA members and age 52 for miscellaneous PEPRA
members, and has at least 5 years of credited service (total service across all CalPERS employers and with certain
other retirement systems with which CalPERS has reciprocity agreements). A CalPERS member who is no longer
actively employed with any CalPERS employer is not eligible for this benefit. An eligible survivor means the surviving
spouse to whom the member was married at least one year before death. A member’s survivor who is eligible for any
other pre-retirement death benefit may choose to receive that death benefit instead of this Optional Settlement 2
Death benefit.

Benefit

The Optional Settlement 2 Death benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the service retirement benefit that the
member would have received had the member retired on the date of his or her death and elected 100 percent to
continue to the eligible survivor after the member’s death. The allowance is payable as long as the surviving spouse
lives, at which time it is continued to any unmarried child(ren) under age 18, if applicable. The total amount paid will
be at least equal to the basic death benefit.



Special Death Benefit
This is a standard benefit for safety members. An employer may elect to provide this benefit for miscellaneous
members.

Eligibility

An employee’s eligible survivor(s) may receive the special death benefit if the member dies while actively employed
and the death is job-related. A CalPERS member who is no longer actively employed with any CalPERS employer is
not eligible for this benefit. An eligible survivor means the surviving spouse to whom the member was married prior
to the onset of the injury or illness that resulted in death. If there is no eligible spouse, an eligible survivor means the
member's unmarried child(ren) under age 22. An eligible survivor who chooses to receive this benefit will not receive
any other death benefit.

Benefit

The special death benefit is a monthly allowance equal to 50 percent of final compensation, and will be increased
whenever the compensation paid to active employees is increased but ceasing to increase when the member would
have attained age 50. The allowance is payable to the surviving spouse until death at which time the allowance is
continued to any unmarried child(ren) under age 22. There is a guarantee that the total amount paid will at least
equal the basic death benefit.

If the member’s death is the result of an accident or injury caused by external violence or physical force incurred in
the performance of the member’s duty, and there are eligible surviving child(ren) (eligible means unmarried
child(ren) under age 22) in addition to an eligible spouse, then an additional monthly allowance is paid equal to
the following:

          •   if 1 eligible child:                       12.5 percent of final compensation
          •   if 2 eligible children:                    20.0 percent of final compensation
          •   if 3 or more eligible children:            25.0 percent of final compensation

Alternate Death Benefit for Local Fire Members
This is an optional benefit available only to local fire members.

Eligibility

An employee’s eligible survivor(s) may receive the alternate death benefit in lieu of the basic death benefit or the
1957 Survivor benefit if the member dies while actively employed and has at least 20 years of total CalPERS service.
A CalPERS member who is no longer actively employed with any CalPERS employer is not eligible for this benefit. An
eligible survivor means the surviving spouse to whom the member was married prior to the onset of the injury or
illness that resulted in death. If there is no eligible spouse, an eligible survivor means the member's unmarried
child(ren) under age 18.

Benefit

The Alternate Death benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the service retirement benefit that the member would
have received had the member retired on the date of his or her death and elected Optional Settlement 2. (A retiree
who elects Optional Settlement 2 receives an allowance that has been reduced so that it will continue to be paid after
his or her death to a surviving beneficiary.) If the member has not yet attained age 50, the benefit is equal to that
which would be payable if the member had retired at age 50, based on service credited at the time of death. The
allowance is payable as long as the surviving spouse lives, at which time it is continued to any unmarried child(ren)
under age 18, if applicable. The total amount paid will be at least equal to the basic death benefit.



Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA)
Standard Benefit

Retirement and survivor allowances are adjusted each year in May for cost of living, beginning the second calendar
year after the year of retirement. The standard cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is 2 percent. Annual adjustments
are calculated by first determining the lesser of 1) 2 percent compounded from the end of the year of retirement or
2) actual rate of inflation. The resulting increase is divided by the total increase provided in prior years. For any given
year, the COLA adjustment may be less than 2 percent (when the rate of inflation is low), may be greater than the
rate of inflation (when the rate of inflation is low after several years of high inflation) or may even be greater than 2
percent (when inflation is high after several years of low inflation).

Improved Benefit

Employers have the option of providing a COLA of 3 percent, 4 percent, or 5 percent, determined in the same
manner as described above for the standard 2 percent COLA. An improved COLA is not available with the 1.5% at 65
formula.



Purchasing Power Protection Allowance (PPPA)
Retirement and survivor allowances are protected against inflation by PPPA. PPPA benefits are cost-of-living
adjustments that are intended to maintain an individual’s allowance at 80 percent of the initial allowance at
retirement adjusted for inflation since retirement. The PPPA benefit will be coordinated with other cost-of-living
adjustments provided under the plan.

Employee Contributions
Each employee contributes toward his or her retirement based upon the retirement formula. The standard employee
contribution is as described below.

    •    The percent contributed below the monthly compensation breakpoint is 0 percent.

    •    The monthly compensation breakpoint is $0 for full and supplemental formula members and $133.33 for
         employees covered by the modified formula.

    •    The percent contributed above the monthly compensation breakpoint depends upon the benefit formula, as
         shown in the table below.

The employer may choose to “pick-up” these contributions for classic members (Employer Paid Member Contributions
or EPMC). EPMC is prohibited for new PEPRA members.

An employer may also include Employee Cost Sharing in the contract, where employees agree to share the cost of
the employer contribution. These contributions are paid in addition to the member contribution.

Auxiliary organizations of the CSU system may elect reduced contribution rates, in which case the offset is $317 and
the contribution rate is 6 percent if members are not covered by Social Security. If members are covered by Social
Security, the offset is $513 and the contribution rate is 5 percent.



Refund of Employee Contributions
If the member’s service with the employer ends, and if the member does not satisfy the eligibility conditions for any
of the retirement benefits above, the member may elect to receive a refund of his or her employee contributions,
which are credited with 6 percent interest compounded annually.

1959 Survivor Benefit
This is a pre-retirement death benefit available only to members not covered by Social Security. Any agency joining
CalPERS subsequent to 1993 is required to provide this benefit if the members are not covered by Social Security.
The benefit is optional for agencies joining CalPERS prior to 1994. Levels 1, 2 and 3 are now closed. Any new agency
or any agency wishing to add this benefit or increase the current level may only choose the 4th or Indexed Level.

This benefit is not included in the results presented in this valuation. More information on this benefit is available on
the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov.

* Counts of members do not include alternate payees receiving benefits while the member is still working. Therefore,
the total counts may not match information on C-1 of the report. Multiple records may exist for those who have
service in more than one coverage group. This does not result in double counting of liabilities.

Normal Cost by Benefit Group
The table below displays the Total Normal Cost broken out by benefit group for Fiscal Year 2019-20. The Total
Normal Cost is the annual cost of service accrual for the fiscal year for active employees and can be viewed as the
long-term contribution rate for the benefits contracted. Generally, the normal cost for a benefit group subject to
more generous benefit provisions will exceed the normal cost for a group with less generous benefits. However,
based on the characteristics of the members (particularly when the number of actives is small), this may not be the
case. Future measurements of the Total Normal Cost for each group may differ significantly from the current values
due to such factors as: changes in the demographics of the group, changes in economic and demographic
assumptions, changes in plan benefits or applicable law.

Note that if a Benefit Group above has multiple bargaining units, each of which has separately contracted for
different benefits such as Employer Paid Member Contributions, then the Normal Cost split does not reflect those
differences. Additionally, if a 2nd Tier Benefit Group amended to the same benefit formula as a 1st Tier Benefit Group
their Normal Costs may be dissimilar due to demographic or other population differences. In these situations you
should consult with your plan actuary.

  PEPRA Member Contribution Rates
  The table below shows the determination of the PEPRA Member contribution rates based on 50 percent of the Total
  Normal Cost for each respective plan on June 30, 2017. Assembly Bill (AB) 340 created PEPRA that implemented new
  benefit formulas and a final compensation period as well as new contribution requirements for new employees. In
  accordance with Section Code 7522.30(b), “new members … shall have an initial contribution rate of at least 50
  percent of the normal cost rate.” The normal cost for the plan is dependent on the benefit levels, actuarial
  assumptions and demographics of the plan particularly the entry age into the plan. Should the total normal cost of
  the plan change by one percent or more from the base total normal cost established for the plan, the new member
  rate shall be 50 percent of the new normal cost rounded to the nearest quarter percent.

  The PEPRA employee contribution rate determined in the table above may not necessarily be 50 percent of the Total
  Normal Cost by Group based on the PEPRA Normal Cost calculation methodology. Each non-pooled plan is stable with
  a sufficiently large demographic representation of active employees. It is preferable to determine normal cost using a
  large active population ongoing so that this rate remains relatively stable. The total PEPRA normal cost will be
  calculated using all active members within a non-pooled plan until the number of members covered under the PEPRA
  formula meets either:

      1.     50 percent of the active population, or
      2.     25 percent of the active population and 100 or more PEPRA members

  Once either of the conditions above is met for a non-pooled plan, the total PEPRA normal cost will be based on the
  active PEPRA population in the plan.

  Accordingly, the total normal cost will be funded equally between employer and employee based on the
  demographics of the employees of that employer.

Glossary of Actuarial Terms
Accrued Liability (also called Actuarial Accrued Liability or Entry Age Normal Accrued Liability)
    The total dollars needed as of the valuation date to fund all benefits earned in the past for current members.

Actuarial Assumptions
    Assumptions made about certain events that will affect pension costs. Assumptions generally can be broken
    down into two categories: demographic and economic. Demographic assumptions include such things as
    mortality, disability and retirement rates. Economic assumptions include discount rate, salary growth and
    inflation.

Actuarial Methods
    Procedures employed by actuaries to achieve certain funding goals of a pension plan. Actuarial methods include
    funding method, setting the length of time to fund the Accrued Liability and determining the Value of Assets.

Actuarial Valuation
    The determination, as of a valuation date of the Normal Cost, Accrued liability, and related actuarial present
    values for a pension plan. These valuations are performed annually or when an employer is contemplating a
    change to their plan provisions.

Amortization Bases
   Separate payment schedules for different portions of the Unfunded Liability. The total Unfunded Liability of a
   Risk Pool or non-pooled plan can be segregated by "cause,” creating “bases” and each such base will be
   separately amortized and paid for over a specific period of time. However, all bases are amortized using
   investment and payroll assumptions from the current valuation. This can be likened to a home having a first
   mortgage of 24 years remaining payments and a second mortgage that has 10 years remaining payments. Each
   base or each mortgage note has its own terms (payment period, principal, etc.)

    Generally, in an actuarial valuation, the separate bases consist of changes in unfunded liability due to contract
    amendments, actuarial assumption changes, actuarial methodology changes, and/or gains and losses. Payment
    periods are determined by Board policy and vary based on the cause of the change.

Amortization Period
   The number of years required to pay off an Amortization Base.

Classic Member (under PEPRA)
    A classic member is a member who joined CalPERS prior to January 1, 2013 and who is not defined as a new
    member under PEPRA. (See definition of new member below)

Discount Rate Assumption
    The actuarial assumption that was called “investment return” in earlier CalPERS reports or “actuarial interest
    rate” in Section 20014 of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law (PERL).

Entry Age
    The earliest age at which a plan member begins to accrue benefits under a defined benefit pension plan. In
    most cases, this is the age of the member on their date of hire.

Entry Age Normal Cost Method
    An actuarial cost method designed to fund a member's total plan benefit over the course of his or her career.
    This method is designed to yield a rate expressed as a level percentage of payroll.
    (The assumed retirement age less the entry age is the amount of time required to fund a member’s total benefit.
    Generally, the older a member on the date of hire, the greater the entry age normal cost. This is mainly because
    there is less time to earn investment income to fund the future benefits.)

Fresh Start
    A Fresh Start is when multiple amortization bases are collapsed to one base and amortized together over a new
    funding period.

Funded Status
   A measure of how well funded, or how "on track" a plan or risk pool is with respect to assets versus accrued
   liabilities. A ratio greater than 100 percent means the plan or risk pool has more assets than liabilities and a ratio
   less than 100 percent means liabilities are greater than assets.

GASB 68
   Statement No. 68 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The accounting standard governing a state
   or local governmental employer’s accounting and financial reporting for pensions. GASB 68 replaces GASB 27
   effective the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2014.

New Member (under PEPRA)
   A new member includes an individual who becomes a member of a public retirement system for the first time on
   or after January 1, 2013, and who was not a member of another public retirement system prior to that date, and
   who is not subject to reciprocity with another public retirement system.

Normal Cost
   The annual cost of service accrual for the upcoming fiscal year for active employees. The normal cost should be
   viewed as the long-term contribution rate.

Pension Actuary
   A business professional that is authorized by the Society of Actuaries, and the American Academy of Actuaries to
   perform the calculations necessary to properly fund a pension plan.

PEPRA
   The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013

Prepayment Contribution
   A payment made by the employer to reduce or eliminate the year’s required employer contribution towards the
   UAL.

Present Value of Benefits (PVB)
    The total dollars needed as of the valuation date to fund all benefits earned in the past or expected to be earned
    in the future for current members.

Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL)
   When a plan or pool’s Value of Assets is less than its Accrued Liability, the difference is the plan or pool’s
   Unfunded Accrued Liability (or unfunded liability). If the unfunded liability is positive, the plan or pool will have
   to pay contributions exceeding the Normal Cost.
