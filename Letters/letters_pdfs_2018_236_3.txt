           Sales Tax Highlights – Second Quarter Sales (April – June 2017)

        Informational Report to the City Council



BACKGROUND

Sales and use tax represents $29.2 million, or 15 percent, of projected General Fund revenue in the
City’s adopted operating budget for fiscal year 2017. Actual sales and use tax revenue was $29.9 million
for fiscal year 2017. This revenue includes sales and use tax for the City of Palo Alto and pool allocations
from the state and Santa Clara County.1

We contract with MuniServices LLC (MuniServices) for sales and use tax recovery services and
informational reports. We use the recovery services and informational reports to help identify
misallocation of tax revenue owed to the City, and to follow up with the California Department of Tax
and Fee Administration (formerly the State Board of Equalization) to ensure that the City receives
identified revenues. We include sales and use tax recovery information in our quarterly reports to the
Policy and Services Committee.

The California Revenue and Taxation Code, Section 7056, requires that sales and use tax data remain
confidential. Therefore, the City may not disclose amounts of tax paid, fluctuations in tax amounts, or
any other information that would disclose the operations of a business. This report, including the
attached Sales Tax Digest Summary, includes certain modifications and omissions to maintain the
required confidentiality of taxpayer information.

MuniServices prepares the Sales Tax Digest Summary and Economic & News Trends report (Attachments
B and D), which we share with the Administrative Services Department (ASD) for use in revenue
forecasting and budgeting. Sales tax information is reported on a calendar-year basis.

DISCUSSION

The Sales Tax Digest Summary covers second quarter sales for calendar year 2017, which are reported as
part of the City’s fiscal year 2018 revenue. In December 2017, ASD should receive information from the
state on aggregate sales and use tax receipts for the third quarter of 2017. Following are some highlights
of the sales and use tax information:
       •    Palo Alto’s overall sales and use tax revenue (cash receipts) for the second quarter of 2017
            decreased by $470,000, or 6.3 percent, including pool allocations, compared to the second
            quarter of 2016. Excluding one-time prior period adjustments of $182,000, the second quarter
            of 2017 decreased by $288,000, or 3.9 percent, including pool allocations, compared to the
            second quarter of 2016. For all Santa Clara County jurisdictions, sales and use tax revenue for
            the second quarter of 2017 decreased by $2.3 million, or 2.1 percent, compared to the second
            quarter of 2016.
       •    Statewide, most regions in California experienced an increase in sales and use tax revenue for
            the year ending in June 2017, with a one-year statewide increase of 2.8 percent.
       •    Palo Alto’s sales and use tax revenue totaled $28.9 million for the year ending in June 2017, an
            increase of 2.5 percent from $28.1 million during the prior one-year period.

          •    Excluding pool allocations and adjusting for prior-period and late payments, Palo Alto’s sales and
               use tax revenue for the second quarter of 2017 decreased by 3.5 percent compared to the
               second quarter of 2016 and increased by 1.8 percent compared to the prior year.

     Economic Influences on Sales and Use Tax

     The Economic News & Trends report discusses economic influences, including national and state
     economic trends, auto, gasoline, retail, e-commerce, restaurant and grocery trends, that may affect the
     City’s sales and use tax revenue.

     Preliminary estimates from the California Employment Development Department show that the
     September 2017 unemployment rate, which is not seasonally adjusted, was 3.3 percent in Santa Clara
     County and 2.2 percent in Palo Alto.

     DEFINITIONS

     In California, either sales tax or use tax may apply to a transaction, but not both. The sales and use tax
     rate in Palo Alto was 9.0 percent during the second quarter of 2017.

     Sales tax – imposed on all California retailers; applies to all retail sales of merchandise (tangible personal
     property) in the state.

     Use tax – generally imposed on consumers of merchandise (tangible personal property) that is used,
     consumed, or stored in this state; purchases from out-of-state retailers when the retailer is not
     registered to collect California tax or does not collect California tax for some other reason; and leases of
     merchandise (tangible personal property).

     Countywide/statewide pools – mechanisms used to allocate local tax that cannot be identified with a
     specific place of sale or use in California. Local tax reported to the pool is distributed to the local
     jurisdiction each calendar quarter using a formula that relates to the direct allocation of local tax to each
     jurisdiction for a given period.

     Examples of taxpayers who report use tax allocated through the countywide pool include:
        • Construction contractors who consume materials used when improving real property and whose
            job site is regarded as the place of business
        • California or out-of-state sellers who ship goods directly to consumers in the county from
            inventory located outside the state
        • Auctioneers, catering trucks, itinerant vendors, and vending machine operators and other
            permit holders who operate in more than one local jurisdiction but are unable to readily identify
            the particular jurisdiction where the taxable transaction takes place

SECTION 1: 2017 HOLIDAY NEWS AND PREDICTIONS

Projected Holiday Sales: Sales during the holiday season are likely to increase 3% to 4%. Online holiday retail sales will
grow by 12% in 2017, accounting for over one‐quarter of total US eCommerce sales for the year. Brick‐and‐mortar sales will
dominate, accounting for about 85% of purchases. (Kiplinger, National Retail Federation and Deloitte,
https://www.forrester.com/report/US+Holiday+2017+Outlook+Digital+Sales+Grow+Boosting+Total+Retail/‐/E‐RES140075)

Holiday Sales: Shoppers plan to spend $728.40 each, on average, on gifts and other holiday‐related items. 96% of the
shoppers intend to make a purchase from a retailer with both a physical and an online presence, and 91%, and 92% of
Millennials plan to buy something at physical locations. Some 40% say they plan to buy items online and pick them up in the
store. (International Council of Shopping Centers, 2017 survey of 2000 shoppers)

Online Shoppers: Plan to spend 70% more than store shoppers this holiday. Non‐store sales, which include online sales
and those from kiosks, are expected to rise 11% to 15%, to roughly $140 billion. In 2016, those sales climbed 12.6%.

Swap (Holiday) Presents On‐Line Before Final Purchase: Target’s “GiftNow” is allowing online shoppers to send an email
to the recipient to see if they want something instead of what was initially selected as a gift.

Self‐Giving: About 70% of shoppers admit that they bought a gift or two for themselves during the holiday season last
year. One common self‐gifting strategy is to offer bonuses with gift cards and holiday purchases. (National Retailers
Federation)

Small Business Saturday / November 25, 2017: Since its inception (founded by American Express) in 2010, the Saturday
after Thanksgiving has become the biggest sales day of the year for many small companies. On Small Business Saturday in
2016, 112 million shoppers spent a reported $15.4 billion at small businesses. https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small‐

Holiday Hiring / 2017: Employers are recruiting seasonal help early as tight labor market sparks urgency, especially for
processing the surge in e‐commerce sales. Amazon increased staff by 77% to 541,900 full‐time employees, largely because
of its purchase of Whole Foods; this does include the more than 120,000 seasonal hires for the holidays.

Auto Financing and Sales Trends
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds‐notes/auto‐financing‐during‐and‐after‐the‐great‐recession‐
20170622.htm (June 22, 2017)

National September Auto Sales: Discounting, demand following hurricane drive monthly performance. From a year
earlier: GM (12%); Toyota (15%); Ford (8.9%); Honda (6.8%) FCA (10%); Nissan (9.5%).

Loan Trends: Twice a Month Payments: Starting in December, MotoLease LLC will roll out a twice‐a‐month payment
structure for subprime lessors. Cutting Back on 84 Month Loan: U.S. Bank has been cutting back on its 84‐month loan
offerings. The company has seen an uptick in 30‐to‐89‐day delinquencies.

Hurricane Impact: “Moderate impact” on auto delinquencies in 3Q2017 due to the recent hurricanes; auto loans 30 to 59
days past due rose 87% to $71 million from the same time the year prior. The increase was primarily due to higher
delinquencies in the auto, home equity, and credit card portfolios in hurricane‐affected states. (Financial Services Group)

Auto‐Part Retailers: Underperformance is in part from a lull in new car sales in 2008 to 2010, which lessened the demand
for replacement parts. CarMax fared better than Advanced Auto Parts, Auto Zone and O’Reilly Automotive. Instead of
servicing or repairing vehicles, CarMax sells new and used cars and offers financing.

Recreation Vehicles/ Outdoor Experience: The nation’s largest network of RV‐centric retail locations, Camping World, will
actively seek opportunities to acquire quality dealerships.

SECTION 5:      GASOLINE

National Gasoline Prices: AAA shows (October 25, 2017) the national average price of self‐serve regular at $2.46 per
gallon. The average price at the pump has fallen for 15 of the last 20 days, by 7 cents. This is 12 cents less than a month
ago and 24 cents more that over a year ago. California Gas Average: $2.91 (July 16, 2017): $2.94 (May 10, 2017); $2.79
(May 10, 2016).

Gas Station with Convenience Stores: A & W: Opening new franchises, including gas station / convenience store
locations in Berkeley and Hayward. 7‐Eleven/ Top Rated Coffee: California’s top‐rated store is 7‐Eleven.
According to the recent GasBuddy footfall report, more than half (56 percent) of Americans who have visited a convenience
store in the past three months feel that the convenience stores make coffee drinks as good as coffeehouses.

SECTION 7:      RETAIL TRENDS

U.S. Retail Mall Vacancies in 3Q2017: Rose to 8.3% due to confirmed closings, including Sears and JC Penny stores. Toys R
Us, The Gap, Teavana and True Religion Jeans. (Reuters)

Warehousing “Showrooming:” Will fuel demand for more logistics space and services. Nordstrom Local is opening in West
Hollywood. Shoppers try on clothes and the merchandise can be retrieved by a nearby Nordstrom or through the website.
Manicures, wine and coffee are available. (https://shop.nordstrom.com/c/nordstrom‐local)

Pop Up Short‐Term Rental Space: Modular spaces with rotating up‐and‐coming retailers offer one solution to fill the gaps.

Ditching the “M word”: 20% of malls have removed the word “mall” from their name since 2014 (common replacements
are “shoppes,” “village” and “towne center.” (JJL survey)

Breweries Anchoring Major Developments Around the U.S.: Craft beer production in the United States has nearly tripled
over the past decade; breweries have become valuable anchors for large mixed‐use projects. (www.bisnow.com)

Luring the 26 Year‐Old Shopper: Companies such as Scotts, Home Depot Inc., Procter & Gamble Co. , Williams‐Sonoma
Inc.’s West Elm and the Sherwin‐Williams Co. are hosting classes and online tutorials to teach such basic skills as how to
mow the lawn, use a tape measure, mop a floor, hammer a nail and pick a paint color. This generation, with its over‐
scheduled childhoods, tech‐dependent lifestyles, etc., is different from previous ones. (WSJ, October 10, 2017)

Outlets: One reason for the stronger performance of outlet centers, is that they’re not weighed down by sagging anchors
like J.C. Penney, Macy’s and Sears. Rather, outlet centers enjoy a relatively balanced mix of retailers, and they’ve largely
escaped the recent spate of store bankruptcies and shutdowns.

Ikea to Acquire “Gig Economy” TaskRabbit: TaskRabbit connects people with freelancers willing to do odd jobs, run
errands, and to assemble Ikea furniture; TaskRabbit is SF based and is available in 40 U.S. cities as well as London.

Consumption Habits Impact Retail Space: Industry is vulnerable to store closures. Americans a whole are consuming less
food on a per‐capita basis, while millennials are increasingly snacking their way through the day. (WSJ, August 1, 2017)

SECTION 8:      E‐COMMERCE TRENDS

U.S. E‐Commerce Results for 2Q2017: Percent of Retail Sales: Increase of 4.8% for 2Q2017 from 1Q2017. Total Sales for
2Q2017: 8.9%. California’s e‐commerce sales comprise approximately 13‐14% the total sales, based on California’s portion
of the national economy. An estimated 40% of U.S. online spending goes to Amazon. (WSJ)

Luxury On‐Line Sales: The absence of high end products hampers Amazon’s push to be a force in the fashion industry;
estimated e‐commerce revenue for 2016: Burberry (8.5%); Tiffany (6%); Louis Vuitton (2.4%); Prada (1.2%).

Shopping Allowance Application for On‐Line Sales: Amazon welcomes teens with new parent‐controlled shopping
allowance application. (Fox News)

Segment Survival ‐ Impacted by E‐Commerce
http://img04.en25.com/Web/JLLAmericas/%7B88537be6‐f837‐429d‐b8ee‐
6c702f665056%7D_JLL_Retail_POV_Screens_to_Stores_Report_FNL_LR.pdf

Diners: Meal subscription services are set to push consumers away from traditional in‐person dining to dining at home.
Ordering online and picking up takeout will be a factor in e‐commerce penetration. Online Outlook: The immediacy of
freshly prepared food will keep this category entrenched in bricks‐and‐mortar.
Off Price Retailers: Consumers look for value when making their purchases, so the unique model of off‐price retailers like
Ross and TJ Maxx/Marshalls makes it very profitable to operate in the physical space., respectively. Online Outlook: E‐
commerce penetration is a negligible; 1.0 percent in this retail category, while same‐store sales growth in 2016 was 3.4
percent.
Dollar Stores: Appeal lies in convenience and low prices, a universal attraction to shoppers across all income levels.
Households with an annual income of more than $100,000 make up 19.0 percent of the revenue at dollar store chains,
compared to 23.0 percent from households with an annual income of less than $25,0006. Retailers in this category
are aggressively expanding, planning 1,250 new stores in the next 12 months. Online Outlook: Dollar stores are all about
saving money, and consumers across income levels appreciate value. This category will continue to flourish in the bricks‐
and‐mortar space.
Sporting Goods: Largely been undone by intense competition from mass merchandisers, online retailers and department
stores. High e‐commerce penetration. Dick’s Sporting Goods remains the prime retail player in this market. Online
Outlook: While a little more than half (56.0 percent) of consumers prefer to buy sporting goods in person, this is a diluted
product category, with sales taking place at mass merchandisers and online, as well as in specialty store.
Toys and Children’s Goods: Shift online, though bricks‐and‐mortar still dominates. Toys and hobby products saw a 16.0
percent jump in e‐commerce from 2015 to 2016, with 13.0 percent of sales occurring online. Online Outlook: While toy
stores and children’s retailers offer the ability to interact with the products before purchasing, online retailers for this
category offer huge time savings for parents.
Office Supplies: Consolidate rather than differentiate. Seen closures along with mergers (Office Depot and Office Max),
reflecting a consolidation of physical space. In 2016 e‐commerce penetration has reached 13.7 percent. Online Outlook:
Office Depot/Office Max is closing 300 stores while Staples is shuttering 70. Online competition is strong for this category.
Electronics: Same‐store sales in the category fell 5.9 percent in 2016, while e‐commerce penetration is 9.5 percent. Best
Buy is a standout. Best Buy is also hiring hundreds of sales people to sit down with consumers in homes and recommend
electronics to buy, part of a fee services; hope to drive sales of TVs and gadgets at a time when few people are visiting
shopping centers. Online Outlook: Only 33% of consumers say they prefer to buy electronics in store. Retailers like Apple
and Best Buy offer high‐touch experiences for draw to physical locations. Will continue to move online.
Book Stores: Large‐format bookstores have already made the move online. Books, along with gifts, are number one for e‐
commerce penetration with 24.8 percent of sales happening online. Online Outlook: Like music and video, the availability
of books in digital format has pushed sales online.
Furniture Showrooms: Consumers want to see and try out furniture in person. Online Outlook: Same‐store sales up 0.5%
in 2016, while e‐commerce penetration is at 19%. Physical retail will continue to dominate the category.
Grocery: Click‐and‐collect and delivery are attractive options for daily needs purchases. Continues to move to an omni‐
channel format, with delivery or pick‐up options. Online Outlook: 93% of consumers prefer to buy food and groceries in
person.
Big Box: Big box discounters like Target remain very popular. Same‐store sales growth was 0.2 percent in 2016. E‐
commerce penetration is at 4.2 percent, and set to grow as major players invest more in their omni‐channel strategies.
Online Outlook: Consumers still prefer to purchase many of their products in‐store (e.g., apparel, household goods, pet
supplies and sporting goods). This category will maintain a strong presence in the physical space.
