Summary Title: Mechanical Parking Studies For Downtown Surface Parking
Lots

Title: Informational Report on Mechanical Parking Studies for Lot D and
Other Surface Parking Lots in Downtown Business District

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Public Works

Recommendation
This is an informational report and no Council action is required.

Background
In December 2016, Council authorized a contract with Watry Design, Inc.
(“Watry”) to provide design and environmental review services for the Downtown
Parking Garage Capital Improvement Program (CIP) project (PE-15007).

Following the award of a contract to Watry, several conceptual options were
developed for the downtown garage. In April 2017, conceptual designs were
presented to Council which included a base option with five above-ground levels,
a retail option with five above-ground levels with retail space, and a basement
option with five above-ground levels and one basement level (no retail space)
(CMR 7942). Council directed staff to proceed with the full preliminary design of a
new parking garage with five levels of above-ground parking, one level of
basement parking, and retail space on the Waverley Street frontage. Council also
directed staff to analyze additional mechanical parking options without causing a
delay in this project.

Discussion
In May 2017, a mechanical parking study was completed by Watry that analyzed
mechanical parking options in the Downtown Parking Garage, adding additional

parking spaces, using a puzzle lift system and a stacker system. Options 1 through
5 below were defined and, for feasible options, compared to the self-park option:

Self-Park Option: Five levels of above-ground parking with retail and one
                  basement level (331 spaces);
Option 1:         Five levels of above-ground parking with retail and one
                  basement level with a two-level puzzle system (basement level
                  and pit) (388 spaces);
Option 2:         Five levels of above-ground parking with retail and one
                  basement level with a two-level stacker system (415 spaces);
Option 3:         Five levels of above-ground parking with retail and a three-
                  level puzzle system (ground level and pit) (364 spaces);
Option 4:         Puzzle system tower with more than a three-level puzzle
                  system;
Option 5:         Mechanical system under the basement ramp.

Options 4 and 5 were deemed nonviable due to the structural impact of an
extended story height and lack of available head room under the basement ramp
area, respectively.

The project cost-per-stall includes the mechanical parking equipment, and soft
and hard costs. The costs do not account for the annual operating maintenance
($40,000 to $50,000), mechanical parking equipment replacement at end of life,
and annual attendant costs ($102,000). The operating maintenance cost is a $30
per stall monthly cost for maintenance by the vendor. In staff’s discussions with
vendors, they stated that they are not aware of any instances in which mechanical
parking is being used for public parking without attendant operation of the
equipment, and they recommended that one or more attendants be on site
depending on the number of mechanical parking spaces. Including these
additional operating and maintenance costs over the lifetime of the garage raises
the cost per stall for mechanical parking options higher than the cost of a
traditional parking space.

attendant costs

Following the analysis of mechanical parking options for the Downtown Parking
Garage project, staff believed that costs might be lower in a dedicated mechanical
parking garage that did not have the inefficiencies of the proposed Downtown
Parking Garage layout. In April 2018, a Request for Information (RFI) for qualified
partners interested in developing mechanical parking projects on City-owned
parking lots in the University Avenue – Downtown Business District was posted on
the City’s eProcurement system. One response to the RFI was received from
Griffin| Swinerton Team in association with CityLift (“Griffin Swinerton”).

In the conceptual design included as part of the RFI response (Attachment A),
Griffin Swinerton chose Lot A at the corner of Lytton Avenue and Emerson Street
to illustrate the design philosophy, space count, cost, project delivery, and
operation of a public mechanical parking lift system. The conceptual designs in
the RFI included three separate parking structures and drive aisles, parking
platform widths of 9’-6” to accommodate nearly all vehicles, and building heights
that vary from three to five levels (20 feet for the 3-level, 26 feet for the 4-level,
and 32 feet for the 5-level). Each parking structure is 96-feet wide and fits 10
parking platforms. CityLift’s Puzzle Lift System (PLS) was chosen by Griffin
Swinerton for this approach.

Design Alternative                Number of Spaces                    Height
3-Level Parking Structure            124 - 140                        20 feet
4-Level Parking Structure            148 - 170                        26 feet
5-Level Parking Structure            180 - 210                        32 feet

Griffin Swinerton developed a preliminary cost model for a prevailing wage,
public-private-partnership (P3) project delivery which reflects current figures as of
April 2018 from both CityLift and Swinerton Builders. The project cost per stall
includes the mechanical parking equipment, foundation, an allowance for building
skin per square foot, roofing, electrical, plumbing, fire sprinklers, site work, and
signage. It also factors in general contractor’s costs. The costs do not account for
contingency, cost escalation, operating maintenance, equipment replacement or
attendant costs.

                       3 Level Puzzle Lift    4 Level Puzzle Lift    5 Level Puzzle Lift
Total Project Costs    $52,576 - $54,950      $54,585 - $57,126      $55,968 - $58,499

Similar to the mechanical parking options reviewed for the Downtown Parking
Garage project, Griffin Swinerton recommended attendants to operate the
parking equipment, and specified the number of attendants at different hours of
the day based on the number of garage spaces. Assuming the number of
recommended attendants for 200 stalls and using the pricing in the City’s current
valet contract, the attendant annual cost would be approximately $360,000.

Overall, staff determined that while the initial installation cost of mechanical
parking may be equal to or less than traditional parking garages per stall, on-going
maintenance costs and the requirement of attendants make the overall cost more
expensive. Mechanical parking also lends itself to residential and commercial
applications where users are familiar with the systems and use them frequently,
which could include future projects providing parking for City staff.

3.      Approach

Grifin|Swinerton in association with CityLift is prepared to design, permit, finance, and construct the mechanical
parking project in close collaboration with the City of Palo Alto. The Project would be delivered using a public-private
partnership (P3) model and structured as a turnkey, build-to-suit transaction. The following describes the integrated
approach of the Griffin|Swinerton Team in association with CityLift in designing a project that meets the City of Palo
Alto’s requirements; processing project approvals at the State and local level; and project financing and delivery using
Griffin|Swinerton’s open book, customizable, and fully transparent guaranteed maximum price (GMP) P3 structure.

3.1. Proof of Concept Design Approach

In the conceptual design included as part of this response, the Griffin|Swinerton Team led by CityLift chose Lot A at the
corner of Lytton Avenue and Emerson Street to illustrate the design philosophy, space count, cost, project delivery,
and operation of a public mechanical parking lift system. Lot A is in a busy node of activity for downtown employees
and retail patrons, so offers a good case study to analyze a high-density parking solution that would serve a variety of
users. Also, to directly address the City’s need for more public parking in the downtown core, the design concept
provides a parking-only solution as opposed to incorporating a mix of uses such as ground floor retail or other
commercial space, a design choice that is aligned with comments made by City staff during the Pre-RFI Teleconference
on April 11, 2018.

City of Palo Alto Planning and Zoning Guidelines
In preparing the response to this RFI, a member of the Griffin|Swinerton Team met in person with the Planning
Manager of the Development Services Center within the City of Palo Alto to discuss the Project concept, the
architectural review process, planning fees, the zoning designation, and the process overall. The following is a brief
discussion of the planning and zoning guidelines that materially impact architectural site planning and layout for
mechanical parking within Palo Alto.

Lot A is in a Public Facilities District (PF) zone and is adjacent to the Downtown Commercial District (CD) zone. The
conceptual site plan provided as part of this RFI response is consistent with the height, floor area ratio, setbacks, and
site coverage requirements under this zone. The PF zone restricts height to 50 feet and in the case of parking facilities
in a PF zone, sets floor area ratio, setbacks, site coverage requirements by the most restrict adjacent zone, in this case
the CD zone which permits buildings conforming to a more urban, dense design paradigm.

The recent March 2017 amendment to the Palo Alto Planning Code (Section 18.54.020) includes provisions for
mechanical lift parking. Section 18.54.020 permits the use of mechanical lift parking for off-street parking, and among
the planning code requirements are provisions for:
    • parking serving permitting building types (multifamily, hotel, industrial, institutional, etc.) or other uses
        approved by the Planning Director
    • required enclosures that screen parking from public view and shall be architecturally compatible with site
        conditions
    • parking spaces that shall accommodate mid-size sport utility vehicles and full-size cars (without going so far as
        to accommodate large sport utility vehicles)
    • submission requirements for analysis and reports of the mechanical parking solution (e.g. effectiveness,
        operational details, drawings, maintenance schedules, and potential impacts, etc.)
    • a requirement that 10% of parking spaces should be standard, non-mechanical spaces for all non-residential
        uses, which would apply to public parking solution.

The Planning staff representative that our Team consulted with also verbally indicated that City Planners will require
that ground floor exterior cladding be permeable and pleasing to pedestrians, rather than a solid, opaque exterior. All
of the aforementioned was taken into account in devising the conceptual site plans as part of this RFI response, in
addition to assumptions on site coverage of improvements, and the various quality levels of building skin/exterior
cladding that were input into the cost estimate within this response.

Parking Dimensions and Space Counts
The conceptual designs shown below included three separate parking structures and drive aisles, parking platform
widths of 9’6” to accommodate nearly all vehicles, and building heights that vary from three to five levels (20 feet for
the 3-level, 26 feet for the 4-level, and 32 feet for the 5-level). Each parking structure is 96-feet wide and fits 10 parking
platforms.

Puzzle Lift System
CityLift’s Puzzle Lift System (PLS) was chosen for this approach as it is the most versatile mechanical parking offering
and is ideal for new construction. These systems are widely used in residential, mixed-use, and public parking structures
in both garages and free-standing parking towers. The PLS is a semi-automated parking solution, where mechanical
systems move a car to its parking space, however putting the car into the systems as well as operating the system
requires a key fob and some action by an attendant (or a trained driver) which is well suited for a public parking solution
where individual safety and liability protection are of critical concerns. The PLS comes in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7-level
configurations, the steel frame doubles as the building structure, and Electric Vehicle (EV) charging can be
accommodated in the parking stalls.

Other key features of the PSL include:
 Project Type                   New construction or retrofit
 Building Application           Free-standing or garage
 Independent Access             Yes

Seismic Considerations
When introducing the mechanical parking system to the U.S. market, CityLift’s structural engineering team designed
the steel members specifically to be free-standing structures that would withstand a 200-year California seismic event.

A Resilient Parking Solution
Understanding that with the rapid advancement of transportation technologies and service offerings underway,
particularly with ride-sharing networks and autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies, we are entering a period of great
uncertainty with respect to parking demand levels over the next several decades. Therefore, all new parking solutions
which require significant upfront investment that would be repaid over a 20- to 30-year timeframe should be able to
address how the system will avoid potential obsolescence.

Rather than thinking about how CityLift’s PLS can be retrofitted to an alternate building use type should parking
demand be dramatically reduced in the coming years, the structural frame of the PLS can be deconstructed and recycled
in a manner that is far cheaper and easier than retrofitting the structure to a commercial building, for example. After
the bolts are removed from the steel members of the parking structure and materials are reused elsewhere or recycled,
a slab will remain which can be repurposed in any manner that the City prefers.

3.2     Entitlements and Permits

As the Griffin|Swinerton Team progresses through Schematic Design (SD), Design Development (DD), and Construction
Documents (CD) during Predevelopment, we will also need to secure a variety of project approvals as described in this
subsection.

Planning Approvals
In terms of the City’s planning approvals process, it is anticipated that the Project will go through an Architectural
Review Board process including community meetings, be reviewed by the Planning & Transportation Commission and
City Council review due to the newness of this mechanical parking as a public facility. It does not appear that the Project
will require a zoning change as the proposed use fits within current PF zoning regulations and planning code
requirements for mechanical parking.

Customary planning fees are anticipated, but it is still an open question as to whether or not the City will require
payment of development impact fees for the Project. Given that the Project contemplated is a public facility delivered
through a public private partnership (P3), the City would be effectively “charging itself” by levying impact fees.

CEQA Clearance
The City will be the lead Agency on processing the required CEQA documents with Griffin|Swinerton being the primary
responsible party to provide the necessary documentation for approvals. The scope, expense, and duration of the CEQA
process will be determined by whether the proposed mechanical parking project will be governed by a Mitigated
Negative Declaration (MND) or full Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to comply with the CEQA requirements for the
project. In embarking on this Project, Griffin|Swinerton would retain an Environmental Consultant experienced in the
CEQA guidelines and mandatory items to be included in an MND or EIR.

Technical studies that would be key in determining the scope of CEQA process include Traffic Study, Air Quality Study,
and Noise Impact Study, among others. Based on the technical reports and other data assembled, our Team would
collaborate with the City to expeditiously prepare an Initial Study for the project using the most recent version of
Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines. Once the Initial Study has been prepared, the CEQA documentation team
will have a better understanding of the type of CEQA document necessary to analyze fully project impacts in compliance

                                                            11
with City and State CEQA guidelines. An MND or EIR would be prepared in accordance with the requirements of CEQA
Guidelines in the State Public Resource Code.

In consultation with the City, our Team can assist the process by compiling of list of agencies and organizations who
will receive copies of all notices and environmental documents. This list will include the local jurisdictions, the State
Clearinghouse, agencies with known permitting responsibilities, and public agencies which may be affected by the
proposed project. Once the controlling CEQA report has been reviewed and accepted by the City, the appropriate
processing steps for approval will be initiated including the public review comment period.

Community Outreach
The main goals of effective community and stakeholder outreach address improving public awareness; minimizing
impacts to residents, businesses, and commuters; and ensuring a safe construction work zone. Griffin|Swinerton has
found that early and frequent involvement and input creates community connections to a project, provides a greater
understanding of project realities, and identifies potential issues before they become problems. Griffin|Swinerton
outreach activities occur pre-, during, and post-construction, including Outreach Plans, holding community meetings,
regular email updates to stakeholders and subscribers, and a dedicated project website/hotline/information channel
to solicit feedback.

Building and Other Permits
This Project will require extensive review by the various departments and divisions involved in both public and private
development projects throughout the City. After the Planning Division has approved the Project and the Project
proceeds through Design Development and Construction Documents, at least the following City review requirements
will apply:
     • Building Division – with overarching responsibility, review of complete building plans
     • Public Works Department – as the project involves site work in the public right-of-way
     • Fire Department – life safety and fire protection/sprinkler system are critical project components
     • Water Quality Control Division – sand oil interceptors will be required for this parking use
     • Water/Wastewater Utilities Division – primarily for fire protection/sprinkler service added
     • Electrical Utilities Division – for bringing electrical disconnects and service meters to the parking lifts

3.3. Public-Private Partnership (P3): Project Financing and Delivery

Griffin|Swinerton is pleased to provide a description of our approach to public-private partnerships (P3) that is
perfectly aligned with the City’s preferred transaction structure that was discussed with the City during the Pre-RFI
Teleconference on April 11. Our P3 structure enables the design, permitting, and construction of the Project as a
turnkey, built-to-suit transaction utilizing privately-financed tax-exempt bonds for 100% of project costs to match the
lowest cost financing available to municipalities.

The Project would be delivered using a public-private partnership (P3) model and structured as a turnkey, build-to-suit
transaction. The P3 legal structure involves a “lease/leaseback” arrangement with the City, where execution of a
Ground Lease (i.e. site lease) and Facility Lease Agreement (i.e. parking facility leaseback) occur simultaneously. As is
typical in our collaborative P3 projects, the Agreements will be jointly produced by the Griffin|Swinerton Team and the
City. The Griffin|Swinerton Team will undertake the financing and development of the parking facilities via a project-
specific not-for-profit company, or Single Purpose Entity (SPE), where City representatives may be designated as board
members of the SPE, should the City so desire, so that the City retains control and oversight of the Project at all times.
When the Project reaches substantial completion of construction and commissioning, Griffin|Swinerton’s role would
end. The City could elect to refinance the outstanding debt or keep the SPE structure in place to avoid additional

                                                           12
transaction costs. When the parking facilities are placed in service, the City would enter into separate contracts with
CityLift for servicing and maintenance of the mechanical lift system and a parking operator.

The diagram below illustrates the relationship of the Griffin|Swinerton Team with the City and the mechanics of our
project-specific financing structure.

By design, the onus of the financing is on the Griffin|Swinerton team to efficiently shift the risk of project execution to
the development team and accelerate project completion. The security for the private financing will be a leasehold
deed of trust (by way of the Ground Lease) supported by the Project’s lease revenue in the Parking Lease with the City,
where lease payments are equal to the debt service payments. Provisions in the Ground Lease and Parking Lease allow
the City, at any time, to take-out the financing, enabling the City’s preferred turn-key project delivery approach.

3.4. Operations and Maintenance

Following the organization in the RFI document, the approach to operations and maintenance is included in the
following Section 4.2.




                                                                                13
4.       Cost

4.1      Total Project Costs

The Griffin|Swinerton Team developed a preliminary cost model for a prevailing wage, P3 project delivery which reflect
current figures as of April 2018 from both CityLift and Swinerton Builders. Costs are preliminary, based on conceptual
designs and will be subject to change over time due to inflation and design refinements. The cost model estimates total
project costs, including the mechanical parking equipment, foundation, a range for building skin ($65 to $80 per square
foot), roofing, electrical, plumbing, fire sprinklers, sitework, and signage. It also factors in general contractor’s costs
and project soft costs.

Property Management/Operations

Ace Parking was consulted for property management, operations, and staffing details. Ace Parking has worked with
CityLift to manage select installations of its mechanical parking systems and is well versed in providing property
management services to public parking lots and garages for municipal clients.

•   Varied Levels of Parking Service – The increased density of parking spaces offers the City a variety of options for
    differentiated levels of parking service and parking space designations.
         o For Downtown Employees: Some parking aisles or space blocks could be dedicated to downtown
            employees on a first come, first service basis whose access is permissible via a special permit from the City
            (for a fee or free, depending). There could be assigned monthly spaces for an additional specialized permit.
         o For Downtown Patrons & Visitors: All or the non-employee remainder of the spaces could be first come,
            first serve for the general public (assuming a 2 to 4 hour time restriction). There is also an option for daily
            parking spaces for a fee.

•   Hours of Operation and Attendant Staffing – operations of parking facilities in downtowns like that of Palo Alto
    generally have peak hours in the morning commute, lunch rush, and evening commute hours. These hours would
    require greater staffing than in non-peak hours in the early morning and late night. The following is based on Ace
    Parking’s general guidelines for staffing peak and non-peak hours for parking facilities in busy suburban
    downtowns. The following theoretical attendant staffing plan assumes a lot has 150 to 200 cars.

    (714) 560‐5788
                                      and Parking Structure. The project consists of two, multi‐level parking structures
    STALLS                            of approximately 900 combined spaces and Transit Oriented Development in the
    375                               heart of the City’s historic Old Town. The facility is anticipated to include mixed‐use
                                      development consisting of both retail and residential uses. The structure arises from
                                      the 2005 OCTA authorization of Metrolink system expansion, including commuter
                                      rail service at the Orange Transportation Center (OTC). Current capacity is 375 stalls
                                      and the projected requirement is 900 stalls. This future demand requires an upgrade
                                      to a multi‐level parking structure, including significant below‐grade construction.

                                            as a fire lane. To provide way finding for transit riders accessing the station from

                                            sense of symmetry.

                                            Embracing sustainability, the design incorporates LED lighting, drought resistant
                                            landscaping and a solar option that provides enough energy to power the
                                            structure’s lighting and elevators. Each of these measures also substantially reduces
                                            maintenance costs. The design team also evaluated cost offsetting measures, such
                                            as outdoor advertising space, leasing coffee and snack kiosks and providing a
