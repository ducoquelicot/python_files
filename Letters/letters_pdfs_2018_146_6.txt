                    City of Palo Alto                                  (ID # 8998)
                    City Council Staff Report

Report Type: Informational Report           Meeting Date: 6/18/2018

Summary Title: CIP Projects Update

Title: Semiannual Update on the Status of Capital Improvement Program
Projects

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Public Works

Recommendation
This report is provided for information only and requires no Council action.

Background
The purpose of this report is to provide Council with an update on the status of
capital improvement program (CIP) projects. Prior to 2016, year-end and mid-
year financial reports included very simplistic status updates on CIP projects. This
is the fourth issuance of a report intending to provide more useful information for
Council. The report includes general fund and all enterprise fund projects. The
project budget information presented is from the FY 2018 capital budget, except
for the Council Infrastructure Plan projects, which include the FY 2019 proposed
capital budget amounts for the total project budget.

Discussion
Project Update Organization

The City has a robust capital improvement program, and a large number of
individual projects are in progress at any given time. The attached CIP project
tables are intended to give Council a quick overview of each project, including
budgetary information, the anticipated completion date, a brief description of the
project scope, the current status of the project, and upcoming activities including
Council actions.

The 2014 Council Infrastructure Plan is a major focus of staff’s capital
improvement program efforts. The following Infrastructure Plan projects are in
progress and are described individually in the project updates:
   • New Public Safety Building (PE-15001)
   • Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Plan Implementation (PL-04010)
   • New Downtown Parking Garage (PE-15007)
   • New California Avenue Area Parking Garage (PE-18000)
   • Charleston/Arastradero Corridor Project (PE-13011)
   • Fire Station 3 Replacement (PE-15003)
   • Highway 101 Pedestrian/Bicycle Overpass Project (PE-11011)

Future updates to Council will include General Fund CIP reports from the
Infrastructure Management System (IMS) detailing where capital investments are
being made and updating the status of the backlog of “catch-up” capital work.

The following are some of the key considerations for the information presented in
the project update tables:

    • The status information is current as of the June 2018 timeframe
    • The individual project tables align with the Capital Improvement Fund
      categories in the FY 2018-2022 capital budget: Buildings and Facilities,
      Parks and Open Space, Streets and Sidewalks, and Traffic and
      Transportation. Enterprise Fund projects follow the order of their
      respective Fund in the capital budget
    • Additional project information is available in the FY 2018-2022 capital
      budget
    • Cubberley Property Infrastructure Fund projects are included in the
      Buildings and Facilities table
    • Each project table is divided into a section for one-time projects and a
      section for recurring projects that have annual ongoing funding
    • Budgetary figures include staff salaries and benefits for projects to which
      salaries and benefits have been allocated

(PE-14018)          Project Status: This project will replace the existing boardwalk with similar alignment and configuration. Council
                    approved a design contract with Biggs Cardosa Associates in August 2016. The preliminary design and
                    environmental assessment of the project were completed in 2017. All applicable permit applications were
                    submitted to the regulatory agencies in 2017, and the project bids were received on May 22, 2018. To avoid the
                    nesting season for Ridgway’s Rails, a federally protected endangered species, the construction duration is
                    limited to the five month period from September 1st through January 31st. Construction will begin as soon as
                    September 1, 2018 and be complete in January 2019 pending Council award June 25, 2018. All required permits
                    are expected to be received in June 2018.

(PE-17006)          Project Status: This project provides funding for the design and environmental review of improvements to the
                    existing network of flood protection levees in the Palo Alto Baylands between San Francisquito Creek and
                    Mountain View. The project will be designed to provide 1% (100 year) protection from tidal flooding, including
                    the impacts of 50 years of future sea level rise. This project will be implemented as an element of the San
                    Francisquito Creek Joint Power Authority (JPA) SAFER Bay Project, which is designing improvements to the
                    Bayfront levees between Mountain View and Redwood City. Construction funding will likely be sought through a
                    regional ballot measure for a special tax or assessment in the affected communities.

Improvements        Project Status: This project will replace worn out or non-functioning exhibits at the Baylands Nature Interpretive
(AC-14001)          Center, including signage and graphics to make the facility more usable for science programs, public use, and
                    facility rentals. Replacement of exterior signage will be coordinated with the Baylands Nature Interpretive
                    Center Facility Improvements project in FY 2018 and with the Baylands Boardwalk Improvements in subsequent
                    years. The replacement railing designs for the Center and Boardwalk will accommodate new signs and exhibits.
                    The current funding levels allow for the reprinting the original exterior signs, but is insufficient to address the
                    current exhibits. Staff is seeking grant funds for new signs/exhibits. Design of the signs is 100% complete. The
                    designs were approved by ARB on Jan. 18, 2018. Fabrication and installation will be completed by July 2018.

                    public access for trails, recreation amenities, and interpretive messaging. Staff interviewed and selected a
                    consultant, AECOM, to create the plan. Staff and the consultant have created an existing conditions report,
                    formed a stakeholder and staff advisory group, held two stakeholder meetings, and one community meeting,
                    and have begun creating draft chapters of the report. The next step in the process is to work on conceptual
                    planning for Byxbee Park and for the former ITT property. Staff has updated the Parks and Recreation
                    Commission on the planning process, and will present to them again in June 2018.

                  Project Status: This project for Seismic Water System Upgrades includes seismic upgrades at the Montebello,
                  Mayfield, Corte Madera, Park, Boronda, and Dahl Reservoirs in compliance with the American Society of Civil
                  Engineers (ASCE 7) seismic codes. Work at the steel tank sites includes the installation of new concrete footings,
                  anchor chairs and tie-downs, installation of seismic shut off valves and control valves, flexible joints at the
                  inlet/outlet piping connections, relocation of various inlet and outlet piping, backup power supplies, and
                  reinforcement and/or replacement of interior tank columns. Seismic upgrade work at the Mayfield Reservoir
                  was completed in Summer 2013 and work on the Boronda Reservoir was completed in summer of 2016. All
                  remaining reservoirs were to be seismically upgraded as part of the Seismic Upgrade of four Steel Tanks and
                  three Turnouts’ Project. However, during construction at the Montebello Reservoir, it was found that the
                  existing roof, support columns and support beams, and floor coating needed total replacement due to their

                     poor condition. Given that all four tanks were constructed at the same time, staff assumes that the remaining 3
                     tanks are in the same condition. In order to determine the most efficient way to upgrade and/or replace the
                     remaining three reservoirs, upgrade work at the Corte Madera, Park and Dahl Reservoirs has been removed
                     from the construction contract. The City is currently under contract with an engineering consultant to study the
                     water system as a whole and make recommendations for upgrades and/or improvements.
