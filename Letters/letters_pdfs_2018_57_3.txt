Subject:              11/5 Council Agenda Questions for Item 7




 Dear Mayor and Council Members:

 On behalf of City Manager Jim Keene, please find below in bold staff responses to inquiries
 made by Council Member Tanaka in regard to the November 5, 2018 council meeting agenda.

 Item 7: Approval to Increase Compensation & Extend Term of Design Contract for Old
 Pumping Plant at RWQCP

 Item 7: Approval to Increase Compensation & Extend Term of Design Contract for Old
 Pumping Plant at RWQCP

           Q. 1. Who was negligent in this to require three amendments, the CONSULTANT who
           provided the evaluations or the public works engineers who vetted the
           CONSULTANT?

           A. 1. In rebuilding a treatment unit that is over 60 years old, there is much that is
           not visible to designers or construction crews. Only when construction commences
           do certain problems and impediments become exposed. We call these “unforeseen
           conditions” and they can cause delays and extra expenses. The first two
           amendments were no cost time extensions. That is, they delayed the work but did
           not increase design costs. Only the third one increased design expenses. All parties
           involved have been exercising due diligence and a proper standard of care in
           upgrading the raw sewage pump station, which was originally built in 1956. Please
           note that although the amendment attached to the staff report restates the
           consultant’s original scope of work, the amendment only addresses the time
           extension and budget increase for additional design work.

           Q. 2. Shouldn’t these issues been caught during the design workshops?

           A. 2. Some additional services design items, namely the motor control center slab
           elevation and the upgraded hazardous atmospheric gas monitoring system
           modifications, were items that arose after the design was complete. These items
           resulted from a discrepancy between datum levels in the City’s record drawings
           from 1956, and a plant standardization on gas monitoring that occurred after the
           design’s completion, respectively. The project’s additional services budget was
           sufficient to cover these expenses. The rest of the additional design work

                                                              1
        was needed to deal with difficult conditions that were revealed during
        construction; it provided critical and timely support of the construction work by the
        original design team. Due to the facility’s age (1956) as well as extensive unforeseen
        and unknown conditions (that are common when retrofitting an aging facility), the
        construction project has encountered numerous conditions requiring additional
        design work beyond that originally budgeted. Unforeseen and unknown conditions
        have been caused by leaks of raw sewage into the pump station wetwell that
        prevented proper dewatering during design; subgrade concrete corrosion that was
        not visible during design stage inspections; buried pipes containing asbestos that
        were not identified on the original design drawing records; and complex changes to
        electrical equipment made over the 60 years of pump station life.

        Q. 3. Did the consultant not know about the delay earlier?

        A. 3. The consultant did not know about the delay earlier. If the unforeseen
        conditions and the succeeding construction delays had been known to the
        consultant earlier, the consultant’s fees would have been adjusted to support the
        larger scope of work. Instead, the increased fees and time extensions are being
        addressed by the three amendments.

        Q. 4. Section 16, Option A states that the consultant shall protect, indemnify, defend
        and hold harmless CITY,... from and against any claims, demands, or liability of any
        nature, including all costs and expenses of whatever nature including attorney fees,
        experts fees, court costs, and disbursements that arise out of, pertain to, or relate to
        negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct of the CONSULTANT, its officers,
        employees, agents or contractors under this Agreement, under this optional
        agreement would the CONSULTANT be liable for any costs due to the delay of
        construction by its own subcontractors?

        A. 4. Staff has not identified any negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct. For
        clarification, the amendment is to the professional services agreement. Actual
        construction of the project by the contractor and its subcontractors is being
        conducted under a separate construction contract.



Thank you,
Judy Ng

                     Item


On Monday please approve the Public Safety Building the Application for Architecture Review.

The 2014 Infrastructure Plan identified the new PSB as the highest priority project for the city. The current police facility
which is about 70 years old is woefully outdated and seismically unsafe. Our surrounding cities such as
Mountain View and San Mateo have much better police buildings. The current facility impedes the ability to
attract and retain top police officers as well as reduces modern operational efficiency.

Any major changes such as trying to change the site location will effectively derail this project as happened with the Park
Boulevard site back in 2007 / 2008.

As council members you have an opportunity to continue to significantly contribute to improving the safety of this city
for its residents and workers for the next 50 years. Please support this action item on Monday. Thank you.

Hamilton Hitchings

Subject:             Public safety building


This matter is before council tonight. It appears there may be higher cost associated with it's construction. However
there are a myriad of possibilities with which to address this and making the project smaller should not be one of them.
As the City grows you want the new public safety building to be to be able to handle this increased demand.

Thank you

Hi all,


A friend na dI weere emailing about the impact on city funding of pensions. It appears likely this will seriously
hurt school funding and likely will bankrupt some cities.

This article gives a glimpse into the impact to California cities of the "catchup payments" in coming
years. See https://californiapolicycenter.org/much‐will‐cities‐counties‐pay‐calpers/

See above spreadsheet for Palo Alto's status.

What are you doing to control pension (and health care) costs?

                                                       The state of California and its local governments are

                                                       estimated to be as high as $583 billion. As a result,
                                                       several municipalities in the state now have the difficult

       Dan‐ I just saw the announcement on Oct. 30, 2018 that "The U.S. High Speed Rail Association has announced
that Dan Richard has been selected as the new Chair of the USHSR Board". Congratulations, and thank you for taking on
this important role.

         This is a further recommendation for you to be the Democratic candidate for President of the United States in
2020.

         Fresno, Ca.

        Dan‐ Here is info re settlement with Shafter:

 https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxvzLNWRlngvjPpvFSQHRrFBtdNw

        Devin Nunes is running against Janz, and Nunes is running really obnoxious ads about how Janz wants to raise
 federal taxes to get a federal "bailout" for Jerry Brown's high speed rail "boondoggle". The Republicans are just
 terrified of what HSR would do for the Central Valley.

        I think Nunes is on the ropes. It has come out that he has never held a real job. He became a politician at age 23
 or something. He does have a straight nose, good teeth, no acne, and a nicely shaped head. Those things count hugely
 in the Central Valley and that has kept him in Congress for years‐ that and millions from rich Republicans whose bidding
 he does in Congress. Janz ads show big private jets taking Nunes to exotic locales, exotic vacations all over Europe, how
 he claims to be a farmer but moved his farm to Iowa years ago, even this: He owns part of a winery in Napa or
 someplace and this winery owns a yacht. Some group rented the yacht and, out on SF Bay, the party allegedly included
 women who were paid to participate. Whether Nunes' constituent taxpayers paid for any protection or for any
 lubricants was never proven. This story seems to have faded, but voters no doubt remember it still. Nunes denied any
 involvement.

         Nunes is the archetype of the guy with no acne and a straight nose, and little else to recommend him, who rich
 Republicans back to do their dirty work. He, along with Kevin McCarthy, David Valadao, and Jeff Denham have done all
 they can in Congress to kill California HSR, as you know. Apparently, the rich Republicans who hire these guys fear
 having the exploited residents of the Central Valley see the Bay Area. And they must have a massive fear of having
 highly paid, well‐educated Silicon Valley types taking HSR into the Central Valley of California and buying homes here.
 That would expose people here to high tech workers, many of whom see through the Republicans. I find adults in
 Fresno who have never heard of Silicon Valley. The Republicans want to keep Fresno like a little town in Alabama in
 1920, when most people went to high school, if that, had no pensions, no health care, no hope, no knowledge of birth
 control and eight children. The doctor, the lawyer and the banker in town sent their sons off to the State university,

                                                            2
 and they then came home and continued the exploitation. Everybody else went to work for the gas company, or the
 grain elevator, when they "left school". HSR will start to modify that scenario in the Central Valley, and the Republicans
 do all in their power to prevent it.

       If the people of the Central Valley have any sense at all, they will fire Devin Nunes, David Valadao, Jeff Denham,
 and, especially, Kevin McCarthy on November 6. They will be better off if they just engage in an "incumbent removal"
 process wrt these guys. Just elect anybody else, and if the anybody else does a lousy job, fire them two years from
 now.

         As you know, Trump's new defense budget is $716 billion. With that gargantuan military, we provide a free
 defense for all of Europe, Japan, Korea, and a lot more. Those people then spend their defense money on high speed
 rail, affordable universities, magnificent universal health care, and a lot more. They view the American people as the
 biggest suckers on the face of the earth, but they are careful never to say that. If a war has to be fought in their neck of
 the woods, they just call the White House and young Americans are soon being slaughtered to defend some corner of
 Europe, or some hell‐hole on the rim of Asia. That needs to change, and the American people should change it at the
 ballot box. They deserve something better than an army of grey‐suited grafters in Washington, working with thousands
 of lobbyists from special interests, some of them foreign, doing all they can to enrich those interests and to ruin the
 lives of the American people.

      POV on PBS recently did a two hour program on "Dark Money", showing how the system works. I highly
 recommend it. The rotten system of campaign finance shown there was enabled hugely by the "Citizens United"
 decision of the Supreme Court.

       Here is a trailer for "Dark Money". The program itself is not on YouTube, for some strange reason. It is worth
seeing, and it will provoke change in our campaign financing system, I believe. Too bad it is not available to see for free
on‐line.

      Everybody wins under our current political system, except for the average American. They get a complete
 screwing, and it will only get worse unless we change the system. If the Republicans can damage or end Social Security
 and Medicare, they will do so. Defund Planned Parenthood, reverse Roe, outlaw abortion and contraception, destroy
 Obamacare, put university education out of reach for all but their own, stop high speed rail, maintain the current lousy
 public school system available to most Americans, destroy what private pension systems still exist, repeal
 environmental laws, encourage coal production and burning, bleed the people white to maintain a gargantuan military
 to defend the whole world, destroy what unions still exist, gut worker safety and other worker protection laws, enable
 the sale of dangerous drugs, such as opioids, to enrich Big Pharma, gut financial protection laws, gut consumer
 protection laws, including food safety laws, rig the system from top to bottom to enrich a handful of rich Republican
 scum and to ruin the lives of the average American.

         The people of California's Central Valley can do their part to improve our country by firing Devin Nunes, David
 Valadao, Jeff Denham and Kevin McCarthy convincingly on Nov. 6. Every Republican in this country should feel the heat
 as well, as the wrath of the American people is expressed at the ballot box.

Subject:          Lack of Housing



Stephanie Munoz, WILPF Peninsula Branch 650 248-1842 101 Alma, apt 701, PaloAlto
                                 Fresh Out of Housing
In advocating for low income housing, we have to keep in mind that when
the Thirteen Colonies successfully revolted against Great Britain, they did
not abrogate the preeminent right of the ruler to dictate the use of land,
they merely reallocated it to themselves. When the US conquered
California, and made California a State, they delegated that power to the
State, which delegated it to the counties and cities they created, which, in
effect, removed the resident cattle herders by demanding tax they were
unable to pay, so the land could be sold to farmers, traders and service
providers, capable of sustaining a money economy , and they kept on with
this practice after the Californio owners were evicted. Money is of interest
to WILPF because when you have a lot of it, and don't spend it on making
a better life for the people, you can buy munitions and feed and transport
soldiers. What WILPF is fighting is the tendency of a nation with a
fixation on being "the greatest" is to make land decisions that will add to
its money at the expense of basic human rights.
It's axiomatic that inflation results in loss of low income housing, but Palo
Alto is a special case because of some special historical circumstances.
Back in the 19th Century, the only son of an extremely wealthy and
politically powerful father, died of typhoid fever, and his mother
determined that the memorial to him would be a university dedicated to
higher education for the poor youth of California, but the two towns
nearest the farm where they intended to install this university objected to
being asked not to sell alcohol to the future students, so the family friends
                                                          1
all bought up nearby land and subdivided it to create the town of Palo
Alto. Less than a hundred years later, during the Cold War between the
US and the USSR, the USSR launched the first satellite, "Sputnik" and
scientists at the university perceived the possibility of combining their
land and expertise with the political power of the city and proximity to a
US airfield and research facility, NASA, to create a technical research
park, which the city obligingly rezoned from "residential", but without
replacing housing for the prospective workers elsewhere in the city--an
egregiously stupid planning error, which vitiated Mrs. Stanford's dream of
college for the poor youth of California, because public education in
California is funded by the property tax, and if you put the money making
entity here, and housing for the workers in a different town or even a
different county, the workers' children won't receive a good enough
education to qualify for Stanford. We now have PAUSD with enough AP
classes to constitute a fifth year of high school, while across the creek in
San Mateo county, Ravenswood School district doesn't even graduate all
its students. So the first mitigation for the jobs /housing imbalance would
be to require large companies to create rental housing in proportion to
their number of workers. If they don't think it up themselves, they won't
want to do it, but it should be becoming clear that they are already missing
out on some workers who balk at the high cost of housing, and that they
can stabilize their work force and contain its cost better if they provide a
safe haven where their recruits can rest their overtaxed heads without
having to drive to for hours to an exurban county.
Society at large-- taxpayers, if you will-- should be the first to realize that
this equation of job desirability with home opportunity, as soon as the
present wave of teachers retires, will become an urgent priority. We
absolutely have to have teachers; we're now paying them an average of
$100,000 a year, and it's not enough to buy, or even rent a home. Since, as
everyone knows, it's the cost of the land, which is in short supply,
continually driving the cost of housing upward, it would be insane for
school districts or cities to let go of land or convert it to any purpose other
than teacher housing until there is enough housing for all the teachers in
                                       2
the district. At first there will be too many places, but the surplus can be
very easily rented to other employees such as janitors or administrators, or
teachers from other districts, pending the maximum need.
The next question is "Doesn't this apply to other city and county workers,
also?" Yes, of course, but it doesn't impact the lives of everyone as much
as a lack of housing for teachers, and the city managers will probably
figure out that it is in their interest to provide worker housing.
Veterans
A special population numbered among the inadequately housed are
veterans. The obligation of our entire nation to furnish acceptable housing
should be paid by our nation as a whole, on no longer used military bases
both as standard housing with rentals gauged by ability to pay, and free
housing and positive care and tutelage for those whose military service
has impacted their ability to function productively in society at large. It is
really not a fair benefits-to-burden state /federal relationship that after the
states drag little savages kicking and screaming through twelve years of
education and indoctrination, the Army uses them for national world
dominance and then gives them back to the states unable to fend for
themselves. It's a national disgrace that we have homeless veterans.
Elderly
Another very large group which can fairly easily be converted from part of
the housing problem to part of the solution; are the minimum income
Social Security and SSI recipients. Although their pension income ($900.)
is small, so they could afford, at most, $600 in rent, it is nonetheless gilt-
edged, backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. No
matter how much a given plot of land can yield in income from a two or
three bedroom apartment complex, it can be made to yield the same
amount by multiplying the number of bedroom/bathroom suites and
stacking them one on top of another, if cities will permit it, which they
have not heretofore done'
This arrangement is quite acceptable to the city fathers when it can be
referred to as a "hotel", taxed as a "hotel tax" on rooms renting for
                                       3
hundreds of dollars a night, but not permitted when it is housing for city
residents. The fly in the ointment seems to be the automobile. The true
motivation of so-called "Nimbys" is that they don't want to share their free
use of the public street for parking, and, with all the pages and pages of
civic agonizing over the impact of the personal automobile on air quality
and traffic congestion, it has not occurred to anybody in transport
management that people might be rewarded for not having cars, or at least
not using them on a daily basis, by receiving prioritization for their
housing needs and sharing an in-house van that would have several set
departures to libraries, doctors, buses, trains, shopping centers, and other
common destinations, and be on-call, at a small fee, for individual
needs. The cost of the van would be negligible when shared by several
hundred residents as would the cost of the building, when spread over
many small investors. If the units were all with full gardened balconies,
they would be more acceptable to city fathers looking for beauty and also
for empty nesters who could rent their homes to larger families.
Elected officials usually claim that developers do not want to build this
type of housing, but they have no grounds for that claim because they have
never permitted it. We should begin by city sponsorship of this
investment; city ownership of the land on long term lease and initial
organization of holding companies to accept investment funds by pension
funds and private individuals, or to solicit investment by public banks.
A further incentive would be that after the lowest income retirees were
taken care of, the individual private investors would have the right to rent
one of these units.
When large tracts of land become available, cities should be given right of
first refusal on them. Since the creation of economy of scale housing is by
special dispensation, there should be no objection to their being rent
controlled, in the case of the elderly, increases would be limited to a basic
rental of no more than 2/3 of the social security pension. ("basic" meaning
not including extras like on-site storage space to accommodate former
homeowners downsizing from large homes, which might double the basic
rent).
                                      4
Once the first "working class hotel" is filled, and the anticipated demand
proven, we might consider the basic room and bath a module which might
be adapted to the needs of people who do not live alone or need a car for
some inescapable reason. They could be built so that two modules could
be joined for a family, or some tenants might rent space in a public garage,
so as to add to the low income family housing supplied by the excellent
organizations such as PAHC and Eden which are dependent on public
subsidy and thus limited to some degree by public policy at the state and
federal level. We have to learn from their expertise at conforming to
public policy formed by neighborhood expectations of attractive
appearance and convenience; for example, when Terman junior high was
closed, the objections of the neighbors were assuaged by the freed space
for both low income housing, discreetly placed at the back, and
community facilities.
Housing could (and should) be added to public buildings because it's
acceptable that public buildings be higher and larger than private
homes;city/county officials should at least consider addition of some
housing when planning new construction or renovation, and give the
public reasons why they decide against it.
The law should require new or remodelled police stations to furnish some
little sleeping place to put homeless men who cause trouble in the regular
shelter, not as a punishment, because they may not understand that their
behavior is wrong, simply as a mandatory alternative to their being in the
shelter. At present, it is public policy to make room in the shelters for
people who might be a danger to the public--it is the reason many women
prefer to avoid shelters. Of course there are anti-social women also, but
there are very few of them and they can usually
be controlled just by avoiding them.
We should be careful not to interfere with the light planes adjacent to
private homes, and have the same amount of landscaping and garden as
the surrounding neighborhood, either on their own site or borrowing from

                                     5
adjacent public open space and parks. Gardened balconies on the upper
stories might serve the need of accommodation to the prevailing FAR
Garages
All garage structures should have toilets and showers on every floor, with
hot water, to be partly paid for by night parking fees and partly by tax
funding for emergency shelter in case of earthquake, fire or flood; the hot
water may be coin operated.
Mini homes: house trailers, RVs and automobiles
It should be understood that cities' preference for value enhancement of
the land equates to discrimination against mobile homes in both
subdivision regulation and building permits, because they carry the stigma
of poverty. Many--perhaps most--of the mobile home owners so
cavalierly expelled from the land beneath their homes were, at one time,
both willing and able to pay the price to be owners of that little piece of
land, but the early owner was not allowed to sell off small pieces, nor were
the subsequent owners of the subdivided land allowed to set mobile homes
on it as principal residences, and often restrictive covenants and
"gentleman's agreements" forbade the sale of properties in certain places
to people of some races or religions, all in the name of property
values. Cities should not allow mobile home parks to be dismantled
unless and until there is some place for the trailer owner to put his
home. Cities also have the power to require upgrades costing many times
the original price of the home, and they should be required to allow you to
import a trailer onto your land if your home is damaged, or live in the
undamaged portion, instead of being allowed to raze it to the ground.
Owners should be allowed to use mobile homes as ADUs.
 In case the city might not be repressive enough, the state has a law that if
there is a change in occupancy use, the building must be brought up to
current seismic standards. That law should be abrogated; it exists only to
prevent preservation of large, solid old buildings for use as low income
housing.

                                      6
RVs should be allowed to park overnight on streets that are not strictly
single family residential, but they should pay a fee which would include a
pass for human waste disposal, and display a sticker showing they have
used this service within a certain period of time, or explain why not.
All but small companies should allow workers to live in RVs in their
parking lots.
There is a movement toward permitting tiny houses to exist; however, if a
structure without a bathroom can be considered a house, then a car can be
considered a house; not only is ownership widespread, but the State itself
has purchased hundreds of still usable cars to keep them from being
driven, Law should require that cities designate publicly owned property
that can be used for stationing some of these cars next to bathrooms like
the ones in state parks, and homeless people should be allowed to rent
these cars for sleeping for a small sum. The law should require that large
tracts of land be offered to the city or county for this purpose if they come
up for sale, the city to have right of first refusal at every price point.
Shelters
There aren't enough of them; they're always oversubscribed, you have to
get there early to have a place, and if there is none, you've spent a lot of
energy getting to someplace you now have to get back from. You can't go
to meetings, like city council, and speak your mind because you have to
check in by 7:00pm. And they're not cheap to run, they provide paid staff,
food, and linens. We need some bare bones back up shelters, some places
near people, like the transit centers (for safety) and with toilets nearby.but
a little bit out of the way, with some kind of backup wall. Or it could be an
unused room, like the basement of the post office, and someone could be
hired to monitor it.
Coordination. There are many housing committees, attached to various
churches and other goodwill organizations. We need a way of calling
each other on short notice to apply political pressure when needed.
ps
                                      7
The churches, instead of getting a little subsidy for providing shelters,
have to pay for permits, which, in the event, they may not get! We should
change that. Some homeless buy an all day pass and ride the 22 bus back
and forth all night; they wake them up and make them GET OFF
THE BUS (at 2am) at the terminus to walk over to the other, departure
side to get back on the bus. We should stop that, too.
Lastly, just as voters demanded that existing ownership of homes should
not be denied continued residence by excessive taxation, renters, who, is
this day are some 44% of the population, should be recognized as having
property rights. The workforce is just as necessary to society as the CEO;
as with the homeowners, it simply isn't fair—nor in the long run
practical—that they should be evicted wholesale when an opportunity
presents itself to make a lot more money from the land. There should be
no demolition of rental housing unless and until the replacement housing
is in place; eviction for just cause only should be mandatory, rights of
renters should be respected when properties are sold, and when there is
some rare occasion when eviction is really necessary, like the roof
blowing off or a fire, the landlord should pay relocation costs.
Rent control should be the normal course for all cities above a certain size,
even if is the type known as “rent stabilization” , without vacancy control
and not including single family homes, and limited to small increases, a
percent or two, year by year. Of course after thirty or forty years these can
mount up, and the landlord is entitled to pass through necessary expenses
like taxes and repairs not the fault of the tenant. When developments of
any kind are permitted, the city should require that there be 50% low
income housing, and when larger than single family or duplex home
property becomes available, for instance by a store going out of business
or moving its premises, the city or county should be given right of first
refusal so as to provide for low income housing.
The discriminatory Costa Hawkins anti rent control law, which made
owners of old rentals continue rent controlled while exempting newer and
therefore more expensive rentals, should be abolished, as should the law
                                      8
requiring seismic upgrades for change of occupancy, and the invidious
Urban Redevelopment laws.

                                  Fresh Out of Housing
In advocating for low income housing, we have to keep in mind that when
the Thirteen Colonies successfully revolted against Great Britain, they did
not abrogate the preeminent right of the ruler to dictate the use of land,
they merely reallocated it to themselves. When the US conquered
California, and made California a State, they delegated that power to the
State, which delegated it to the counties and cities they created, which, in
effect, removed the resident cattle herders by demanding tax they were
unable to pay, so the land could be sold to farmers, traders and service
providers, capable of sustaining a money economy , and they kept on with
this practice after the Californio owners were evicted. Money is of interest
to WILPF because when you have a lot of it, and don't spend it on making
a better life for the people, you can buy munitions and feed and transport
soldiers. What WILPF is fighting is the tendency of a nation with a
fixation on being "the greatest" is to make land decisions that will add to
its money at the expense of basic human rights.
It's axiomatic that inflation results in loss of low income housing, but Palo
Alto is a special case because of some special historical circumstances.
Back in the 19th Century, the only son of an extremely wealthy and
politically powerful father, died of typhoid fever, and his mother
determined that the memorial to him would be a university dedicated to
higher education for the poor youth of California, but the two towns
nearest the farm where they intended to install this university objected to
being asked not to sell alcohol to the future students, so the family friends
all bought up nearby land and subdivided it to create the town of Palo
Alto. Less than a hundred years later, during the Cold War between the
US and the USSR, the USSR launched the first satellite, "Sputnik" and
scientists at the university perceived the possibility of combining their
land and expertise with the political power of the city and proximity to a

Re: Lack of Notice for Veteran’s Day Observance


Elected Council Members:

I was disappointed to read in a local blog that the City had held some sort of remembrance for veterans at City Hall
without providing reasonable notice to the public about the event.

I looked at the City’s web-site, and there didn’t seem to be anything that looked like an announcement, or an after-event
press release. There are notices for events only of interest to foreign nationals, however. Certainly, the City should be
able to obtain a list of veterans who might be interested in attending these sorts of events. A simple e-mail would do the
trick of alerting them to when and where such events would be held.

There probably aren’t that many veterans living here in Palo Alto, although certainly those hospitalized in the VA Health
Care Center would increase that number considerably, should those numbers be included.

One can only wonder if the City is not willing to advertise this event in a meaningful way—what have it at all?

Subject:             Meeting of November 5, 2018


Hello Mr. Lait,

The purpose of this email is to summarize our meeting this afternoon.

Architect Peter Ko was incredulous that in your Determination Letter of October 16, 2018, you rejected the material,
color and craftsmanship detail as it relates to the concrete walls specially in view of the fact that there was no indication
of such objection in all previous meetings with Planning. Since the walls are structural and an integral part of the
construction drawings, changes to the walls would result in a major overhaul of the construction drawings that Ko
Architects have been working on since September 1, 2017. The construction drawings were submitted for Plan Checking
in March 2018 and had been reviewed, scrutinized and approved by numerous departments in the City. Any changes
would have to be recirculated to these departments, some of which take months and several iterations for
approval. The cost of such would be in the hundreds of thousand of dollars.

This rejection is specially egregious considering that Ms. Gerhardt would not consider scheduling the ARB hearings until
August of 2018. We had been requesting the ARB hearings formally and in writing since February 1, 2018. Previously
we requested for the ARB process to begin many times verbally since September 2017 when Mr. Ko took over the
construction document phase of the project.

Regarding the Council Hearing date, my attorney, Mr. Kassouni, will take your offer of having the item pulled and heard
by Council on the same day. His commute is several hours each way. Further, I would find it impossible to ask my
speakers to Council to appear more than one time. As stated at the meeting, December 10, 2018, would be preferred,
or November 26, 2018. We can also appear December 3, 2018, with a substitute attorney. Please call me to finalize this
date.

At the meeting I objected to your purporting the disapproval of the materials, colors, and craftsmanship details based on
my "refusal" to implement structural and design changes. This is gross overstatement as we made continuous and
repeated changes to get all departmental approvals including Planning's unending requests to satisfy and get the full
support of Ms. Gerhardt, Mr. Petersen and yours. Your approvals are clearly stated in all three staff reports for ARB
Minor Level which reviewed the color, materials and craftsmanship details.

Further, the fact that you were proposing to yet again take the project to the ARB is a waste of valuable time and
resources as its recommendation is not required for your approval. You mistakenly stated that ARB's recommendation
is needed before you would approve color, material and craftsmanship detail which you classified as “minor” and
submitted to 3 ARB Minor Level Reviews.

I also want to remind you that ARB has never recommended approval since the project was appealed by Michael
Harbour. The project was meticulously presented and rejected at least 16 times at Major ARB hearings before it was
approved by Council. ARB failed to recommend the project an additional 3 times after Council approved this project. At
all these hearings Mr. Harbour tanked the project from every angle including mass and compatibility both of which were
previously approved by Council and not subject to the 3 ARB Minor Level review hearings on August 16, 2018,
September 20, 2018, and October 4, 2018.

                                                              1
For the record, I requested that Ms. Gerhardt be removed from this project for many reasons including her deference to
Michael Harbour's opinions and her untimely response to our repeated requests for ARB hearings.

Please call me to finalize the Council hearing date for my appeal.

Thank you.

Elizabeth Wong

NEW YORK, Oct. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ —
      Five new published studies support previous research linking fluoride to thyroid
disease; ADHD; overdosing formula-fed infants and bias in government reports.
Another reveals pregnant Canadians have higher urine fluoride levels in fluoridated vs.
non-fluoridated areas which previous studies linked to offspring’s lower IQ, reports New
York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation, Inc. (NYSCOF).
1) Fluoride exposure coupled with iodine deficiency is linked to thyroid
 disease, report researchers in Environment International (December 2018). They report that
this is the first human population-based examination of chronic low-level fluoride exposure
on thyroid function that considers residents’ iodine status.
“I have grave concerns about the health effects of fluoride exposure,” said lead author Ashley Malin, “And not
just from my study but the other studies that have come out in recent years,” (quoted from Bienkowski).
2) “Higher levels of fluoride exposure during pregnancy were associated with global
measures of ADHD and more symptoms of inattention [in offspring],” researchers report
in Environment International (December 2018). This is consistent with a growing body of evidence
linking neurotoxicity to early-life fluoride exposure, they report.
3) “Significantly more infants, particularly those under six months old, will exceed the UL
[Upper Limit] when consuming formula reconstituted with 0.7 ppm [fluoride] water, increasing their risk
of developing dental fluorosis.” (Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry, 2018).
“The primary adverse effects associated with chronic, excess fluoride intake are enamel and skeletal
fluorosis.” (NAS 1997).
The CDC encourages the addition of fluoride chemicals into public water supplies to reach 0.7 ppm without
adequately informing parents about the consequences of fluoride overexposure.
4) Organizational bias compromised the integrity of fluoride research from the
beginning and persists today (Medical Hypotheses, December 2018) The authors identify ten
major flaws in a recent US National Toxicology Program (NTP) fluoride experiment as an example of how
institutional bias can skew science.
5) Canadian pregnant women have double urine fluoride levels in fluoridated vs. non-
fluoridated areas (Environmental Health Perspectives, October 10, 2018). Previous Mexican
research links urine fluoride levels in pregnancy to offspring’s lower IQ. The Canadian and Mexican women’s
fluoride levels are similar which causes concern.

Subject:               Airplane Worse and Worse


Hi all,

I thought we had gotten some recognition from the FAA and some agreement to reduce noise over Palo Alto. Instead
they have come up with a new plan called PIRAT which may be great for Santa Cruz and San Mateo Counties but even
worse for Palo Alto. I agree with the letter below.


Subject: PIRAT

I appreciate Ed Shikada’s update to Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the actions city staff are taking to
address airplane noise.

Based on Palo Alto’s previous experiences and to avoid omissions I ask the City to challenge the FAA in the strongest
possible way, including:

         Take appropriate legal options, if any
         Work with other potentially impacted Cities (when interests are aligned) in order to strengthen the actions
         Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge areas

In addition, I urge you to work with Anna Eshoo of (most likely) Diane Feinstein to have them also exert their influence
on the FAA to remedy their new and worse impacts to Palo Alto.

Best regards.

Dear Council Members,

I appreciate Ed Shikada’s update to Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the actions city staff are
taking to address airplane noise.
Based on Palo Alto’s previous experiences and to avoid omissions I ask the City to challenge the FAA in the
strongest possible way, including:

      Take appropriate legal options, if any
      Work with other potentially impacted Cities (when interests are aligned) in order to strengthen the
       actions
      Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge areas

I care about this ‐ I teach music in a sound‐proofed studio, and I can hear the planes and they make it difficult
for my students (and myself) to really hear the low sounds they need to hear (it's a physics thing, if you're
interested I'll give you details) for really accurate tuning.

Sincerely,
Virginia Smedberg

Subject:               Subject: PIRAT -- in the time it has taken me to write this....


I have been subjected to the noise of 6 airplanes, headed toward SFO. And I am inside. Behind insulated walls and
triple paned, closed windows. It's 11:06 a.m. on a Monday. Fairly innocuous timing. But 6 airplanes in ~ 3 minutes?

How long must Palo Alto residents suffer this?

While I appreciate Ed Shikada’s update to Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the actions city staff are taking
to address airplane noise, I think enough is enough and it's been a long long long time w/ no measurable changes. I
would prefer quiet skies. Based on Palo Alto’s previous experiences and to avoid omissions I ask the City to challenge
the FAA in the strongest possible way, including:

         Take any and all appropriate legal options,
         Work with other potentially impacted Cities (when interests are aligned) in order to strengthen the actions
         Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge areas


If we can spend 9 M blowing up south Palo Alto's streets with ridiculous roundabouts and road furniture all in a misguided
bid for increased bike "safety" that ends up DIRECTLY endangering my four bicycle riding kids, how is it we cannot
manage to dredge up whatever funds are needed to make Palo Alto a quieter place for ALL residents?

Please. Be my favorite city council yet. Do something = efficacious.

Cheers,

Ref: PIRAT
As many are aware, in addition to impacts from other airports SJC, SQL and PAO, Palo Alto and MidPeninsula cities are
impacted by three SFO published procedures. Procedures are the FAA directives that document waypoints and altitudes
for pilots and planes to follow. The SERFR procedure is used for Southerly arrivals, BDEGA is for flights from the North,
and the Oceanic procedure is for flights from the West. We noticed the new procedure PIRAT on the FAA procedures
implementation website on October 23, and immediately alerted the City. PIRAT is being published to replace the Oceanic
procedure.

Aside from the concern that FAA has not yet returned to continue working with communities (as they committed to) on
their Initiative to address SFO noise, FAA is publishing PIRAT with a Catex, which is the lowest level of screening for
impacts on the ground. To qualify for a Catex, 2012 Nextgen legislation requires demonstrable noise reduction; however,
the changes with PIRAT contain significant changes from Oceanic which do not appear to decrease noise. For example
Oceanic is currently available for use by certain operators but PIRAT will permit all SFO operators to use the procedure.
Also, after a waypoint called “ARGGG” in Woodside, PIRAT thereafter opens Mid Peninsula cities for Air Traffic Control
vectoring of PIRAT flights. We have heard from an expert (who does analysis of vectoring for projects around the country)
that vectoring ends up happening over the same areas (as opposed to random dispersion), so the communities who will
be vectored over, by Pirat, need to know what are the likely repetitive paths; at what altitudes, and what volume of planes
to expect. The Catex was unfortunately not disclosed to the public when originally signed in July, which is yet another
problem.

Given the serious and unresolved noise concerns since 2014, we don’t think it’s appropriate for FAA and SFO develop or
publish new procedures and plans which claim “no harm” and in such a non-transparent manner - without data analysis
for the public, projections, or without any public involvement. The Phoenix CATEX was challenged successfully for many
of the same problems exhibited by PIRAT.


                                                                 5
PACC voted in May for staff to come back with a “fast track” process to ensure that petitions for review are filed on time.
As staff and PACC prepares the fast track process for PIRAT, we expect the City to use the "comments" opportunity due
November 13 to already challenge FAA and thoroughly express community concerns.

Local officials and SFO have a MAJOR role in helping us get FAA attention. We need the City and elected officials to urge
FAA to take PIRAT to a higher level of review, or a more robust process with community input. With EXTRA attention to
the night and 4:30 AM flights on this procedure which urgently need ALTERNATIVES OVER THE BAY!!

            Dear Friends,

            We are forwarding here an IMPORTANT email alert and call to action from Council member Lydia Kou
            about a new SFO arrival procedure PIRAT. Please note our highlights.

Message from Council member Lydia Kou:

Many people find airplane noise to be a huge nuisance, especially if the airplanes are flying
over your home almost every two minutes. Recently, changes were introduced to a flight
procedure named PIRAT which essentially directs a flight path over a number of cities,
including Palo Alto.

Below is a screen shot of live air traffic showing the PIRAT ground path used
recently. It moved arrivals further south and positions the turns back to SFO over
Stanford, Palo Alto, Mountain View and East Palo Alto. Suffice it to say, this puts the
track and the noisy turn directly over us.




Residents alerted City Staff and at the 10/29 City Council meeting, Acting City
Manager Ed Shikada provided an update on a planned FAA procedure called PIRAT.

https://youtu.be/nqAXYvg1UIU?t=313

I am pleased to hear Staff is moving toward addressing this by the fast approaching
11/13 “Comments period” deadline.

Because details matter, I’m asking you to send an email to the City Council
ASAP with the following points:

Hi Lydia,

though I support anyone who suffers, i have only heard the
the airplanes a couple of times. i live across from the loving hands nursery school in Midtown
at Marion and middlefield.
how many people have the airplanes hit ? as cars go, we have a thousand ++ car accidents here a
each year with over one third resulting in INJURIES.
yet, only two council members care very much. 33 of my friends wrote you folks.
we deserve speed enforcement and safety and PEACE from the speeding noise. in our case, it wasn’t just one person
writing 90+++% of the complaints.

it is so scary to exit our driveways also.

can you please consider, advocating for traffic calming on our residential arterials,
 like you might for other citizens who pay these high taxes for our homes.?

as for who to vote for, i can sure use some suggestions. i do support mr. filtheth.
thank you,

minutes. Recently, changes were introduced to a flight procedure named PIRAT which essentially directs a flight p
number of cities, including Palo Alto.


Below is a screen shot of live air traffic showing the PIRAT ground path used recently. It moved arrivals further sou
positions the turns back to SFO over Stanford, Palo Alto, Mountain View and East Palo Alto. Suffice it to say, this p
and the noisy turn directly over us.

Residents alerted City Staff and at the 10/29 City Council meeting, Acting City Manager Ed Shikada provided an up
planned FAA procedure called PIRAT.




                                              18
I am pleased to hear Staff is moving toward addressing this by the fast approaching 11/13 “Comments period” deadline


Because details matter, I’m asking you to send an email to the City Council ASAP with the following points:

Dear Mayor and Council Members:
  I am writing to you so that you have time to file an appeal against the FAA in their new PIRAT procedure. You have
about 1 week left to do something about the deteriorating state of my home and City due to all the Foreign carriers
flying into SFO. As you probably know, SFO is increasing throughput from Asia which is only making the noise worse! I
see the markings of the underbelly of planes from Hawaii, Tel Aviv, Singapore, China, Japan, Australia and
others. Please stand up and file an appeal to any categorical exclusions that the FAA maintains to deny any type of
environmental laws supported by your constituents.
  Fast Track process should mean you have enough time to file appeals.

Sincerely,
Kerry Yarkin

Dear Council,

I appreciate Ed Shikada’s update to Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the actions city staff are
taking to address airplane noise.

Based on Palo Alto’s previous experiences and to avoid omissions I ask the City to use the comments due
November 13 to challenge the FAA on the use of a categorical exclusion for PIRAT in the strongest
possible way, and

     File for a petition for review if FAA offers no answers to various concerns about NEPA process
      and FAA following own rules
     Work with other potentially impacted Cities (when interests are aligned) in order to strengthen the actions
     Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge areas
     Provide updates to concerned citizens and ensure that all communications to FAA receive Council's
      input before making binding and irrevocable decisions that limit future options.

A proper resolution for PIRAT would be to ask for the new roundtable to review it in the new yearn in the
context of follow up to the Select Committee recommendations. This procedure has SERIOUS night and
early morning impacts which should please not get a "pass" or an unchallenged "no impact" record
of decision.

Thank you,

Jennifer Landesmann


PS: the Catex was not made public when it was first published. Procedure was due to have a publish date
of November 8, suddenly we find out it has a record of decision signed since July? That alone should be
grounds to petition for review.

Will it be a decade before any action is taken?
Is the FAA just waiting for P.A. to get tired and to away?
Or until everyone who lived here when NextGen was implemented has died or moved away?

Do NOT stop working on this issue.

Dear Palo Alto City Council Members:

Please review the following and do whatever possible to prevent the PIRAT flight path from making things worse than
they already are.

The email below is in error because I am seeing air traffic from all four directions, and from all three major airports, flying
over my house in Midtown, per the stop.jetnoise app. In other words the FAA is not sticking to specific flight paths for
specific destinations and airports, it is routing air traffic over Palo Alto from any source to any source. Since 2015, the
jet noise at my home is terrible and I'm extremely frustrated and angry about it. The response from the city has been
underwhelming.

Sincerely yours, Anne Gregory

As many are aware, in addition to impacts from other airports SJC, SQL and PAO, Palo Alto and MidPeninsula cities are i
by three SFO published procedures. Procedures are the FAA directives that document waypoints and altitudes for pilots
planes to follow. The SERFR procedure is used for Southerly arrivals, BDEGA is for flights from the North, and the Ocean
procedure is for flights from the West. We noticed the new procedure PIRAT on the FAA procedures implementation w
October 23, and immediately alerted the City. PIRAT is being published to replace the Oceanic procedure.

Aside from the concern that FAA has not yet returned to continue working with communities (as they committe
their Initiative to address SFO noise, FAA is publishing PIRAT with a Catex, which is the lowest level of screen
impacts on the ground. To qualify for a Catex, 2012 Nextgen legislation requires demonstrable noise reduction
however, the changes with PIRAT contain significant changes from Oceanic which do not appear to de
noise. For example Oceanic is currently available for use by certain operators but PIRAT will permit all SFO o
to use the procedure. Also, after a waypoint called “ARGGG” in Woodside, PIRAT thereafter opens Mid Peninsula
Air Traffic Control vectoring of PIRAT flights. We have heard from an expert (who does analysis of vectoring for projects

Given the serious and unresolved noise concerns since 2014, we don’t think it’s appropriate for FAA and SFO
or publish new procedures and plans which claim “no harm” and in such a non-transparent manner - without d
analysis for the public, projections, or without any public involvement. The Phoenix CATEX was challenged su
for many of the same problems exhibited by PIRAT.

PACC voted in May for staff to come back with a “fast track” process to ensure that petitions for review
filed on time. As staff and PACC prepares the fast track process for PIRAT, we expect the City to use the "comments" o
due November 13 to already challenge FAA and thoroughly express community concerns.

Local officials and SFO have a MAJOR role in helping us get FAA attention. We need the City and elected officials

The City of Palo Alto has a serious problem with PIRAT and the GBAS landing system.

I appreciate Ed Shikada’s update to Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the actions city staff
are taking to address airplane noise.
Based on Palo Alto’s previous experiences and to avoid omissions I ask the City to challenge the FAA in

    Provide updates to and receive Council’s input before making binding and irrevocable decisions that
      limit future options

Please remember that the City of Palo Alto did not take a strong enough lead on the original NEXTGEN
changes and look at what happened. We do not even have a seat on the SFO Roundtable and can’t vote.
Yet, we are the primary peninsula city that has to bear the burden of incessant flights and toxins. Now the
other cities have taken a NIMBY approach. It is imperative that the City take an active and aggressive
approach to remedy a terrible situation that has the potential to get even worse with PIRAT. Please make
an impact on SFO’s future GBAS landing system. Please be PROACTIVE and truly represent the people
of Palo Alto in this critical matter.



I wish we had more people on the council like Lydia Kou who has taken an active interest in a problem
that has definitely compromised the quality of life in Palo Alto. Give her all the support she and others
need to influence the future of the GBAS landing system. Do not take another passive approach and let
history repeat itself.

Dear Mayor Kniss and Members of the City Council,

I understand that the the FAA has recently altered the ground path for incoming flights, moving the arrivals farther
south with the turnback occurring over our area. As you know, this is likely to once again increase our exposure to
aircraft noise.

Based on Palo Alto’s long-standing concern about this problem I ask the City to challenge the FAA in the strongest
possible way, including:

                 Taking appropriate legal options, if any
                 Working with other potentially impacted Cities (when interests are aligned) in order to
                  strengthen the actions
                 Enlisting specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge
                  areas

When I moved to Palo Alto 30+ years ago, the sound of a jet doing the “turnback” over our home was so unusual
that I once ran outside to see where the plane was going to crash! Now, of course, it’s a rarity when we have a few
minutes of quiet!

I am pleased to hear that Staff is working on this. Please continue to press ahead on this important quality of life issue.

Dear Palo Alto City Council members.

Regarding the planned PIRAT procedure, as a Palo Alto homeowner whose home is already
directly under a busy flight path to SFO, I appreciate the actions city staff are taking to address
airplane noise.

Based on Palo Alto’s previous experiences and to avoid omissions I ask the City to challenge the
FAA in the strongest possible way, including:

     Take appropriate legal options, if any
     Work with other potentially impacted Cities (when interests are aligned) in order to

     Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge
      areas
     Provide updates to and receive Council's input before making binding and irrevocable
      decisions that limit future options.

My quality of life in my College Terrace home where I have lived for the last 28 years has been
severely and negatively impacted by NEXT GEN. I seriously hope something can be done to
mitigate the almost constant air traffic that occurs day and night over my home and my Palo
Alto neighbor' homes.

Thank you,

I'm writing to you (again) to express concern over the air traffic over my neighborhood. Many of us have been
significantly affected by increased air traffic and noise ever since the changes implemented in 2014 by the FAA. I hope
you will take all appropriate legal (and other) action to protect the citizenry from arbitrary and detrimental decisions by
the FAA. I don't know enough about PIRAT to understand its likely impact, but given the FAA's history, I have little trust
in them.

Our quality of life has suffered enough‐ if you can't fix the problem, at least don't allow them to make it worse!

Spread the traffic around, put more of it over the bay, require the planes to fly higher when over the populated areas‐
all these would help alleviate the problem.

Thanks for reading

Daniel Lilienstein

Now after suffering for several years with no action being taken to protect Palo Alto and Stanford from loud, low flying
aircraft, here comes another procedure that affects Palo Alto and again the city council and its employees didn’t seem to
know anything about it until a private citizen brought it to their attention.
And the deadline for comments is right upon us. Let us not let this pass like you did the last time.

Thank god we elected Lydia Kuo. At least she cares about what concerns her constituents unlike several of the other
council members.

So I and many others are writing to the city council for the umpteenth time asking for help in challenging these changes.

• Take appropriate legal options, if any • Work with other potentially impacted cities (when interests are aligned) in
order to strengthen the actions • Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable
challenge areas • Provide updates to and receive Council’s input before making any binding and irrevocable decisions
that limits future options.

Please help Palo Alto citizens live a more peaceful and healthy life.

   Dear City of Palo Alto Council Members.

   Ed Shikada’s to update to Council on the latest proposed FAA regulation proposals related to the
   planned PIRAT flight procedure and its potential/likely impact on the citizens of Palo Alto was very
   timely. I appreciate the actions city staff are taking to address airplane noise problem. As he
   pointed out, the response and questions to the FAA on the new proposal is time sensitive with input
   required by November 13th to have any benefit.

   It is important that the Council receive updates on progress over the next 9 days to avoid
   missing the deadline and so the Council has time to provide guidance to the city staff on their
   response to the FAA.

   I have spoken several times at the City Council meetings on this topic and I strongly urge the City of
   Palo Alto to:

        Take appropriate legal action to make sure the FAA focuses on the noise and pollution impact
           of the current and proposed flight patterns,
        Work with nearby potentially impacted cities in order to strengthen input to the FAA on the
           PIRAT proposal
        Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable options for
           challenging the minimal environmental impact review

   Thank you for you continued attention to this matter.

Subject:             Rinconada Masters and TeamSheeper - message from a concerned Palo Altan


Dear Members of the Palo Alto City Council,

My name is Don Williams, and I am writing in support of the Rinconada Masters. I am a Palo Alto resident and graduate
of Paly (’84) with a long history of using Rinconada pool. In fact I learned to swim at Rinconada Pool in the early 1970s,
swam there with Palo Alto Swim Club through the mid‐1980s, and joined Rinconada Masters there in 1989. As such, I
am both part of the taxpayer base that pays for the upkeep of Rinconada Pool and more important, one of the large
community of pool users that pre‐dates TeamSheeper.

I am concerned that TeamSheeper is not respecting this existing community of users, and Rinconada Masters in
particular. In a contract dispute over who needed to cover Rinconada pool after the 7‐8:30 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday
time slot, TeamSheeper took a position clearly inconsistent with the language of the contract, and was ultimately forced
to back down. However, their behavior became less friendly and more aggressive after that disagreement. Their
objective now seems to be force Rinconada Masters out of the pool we have called home for decades.

Rinconada Masters has a long and storied history as a Palo Alto community team. It was one of the first masters’
programs on the Peninsula, hosts a well‐regarded annual swim meet as well as other team events, and is unique among
local masters’ programs in its broad array of swimming levels, from very beginning to advanced. Moreover, Carol
Macpherson, its Founder and head coach, is a superb stroke coach who has helped many swimmers greatly improve
their strokes and thereby achieve their full potential.

The reasons I understand TeamSheeper identified for recently choosing not to select Rinconada Masters as the masters
team subcontractor are suspect. They claim there is a “safety” issue in that Rinconada Masters does not always have
two certified lifeguards on deck. However, Rinconada Masters has run practices having one lifeguard for decades
without safety issues, and moreover I have been at lap swimming sessions run by TeamSheeper within the last six
months when they only had one lifeguard on deck. They state Rinconada Masters does not communicate well, and are
not team players. However, communication is a two‐way street, and there has been little if any from TeamSheeper,
particularly since the above‐mentioned contract dispute. And Rinconada Masters as a team has a strong collaborative
and community spirit, which suggests the issue with being a “team player” does not rest with us. We are ready and
willing to collaborate with TeamSheeper, but their conduct suggests they may not be interested in doing so.

Rather than helping balance competing interests in this difficult situation, and putting the needs of the community of
Rinconada Pool users first and foremost, unfortunately it appears that some members of the City Staff may be more
focused on assisting TeamSheeper to achieve its commercial objectives. In particular, it is extremely surprising that the
City’s RFP process resulted in only one bid, from TeamSheeper, and frankly calls into question the integrity of the
contract award process. It is also surprising the extent to which some members of the City Staff have acted as
TeamSheeper’s mouthpiece and advocate in this process, characterizing pool users’ responses as far more favorable
than has actually been the case—and enabling TeamSheeper itself to avoid having to answer questions regarding its
motivations and conduct. Moreover, at the Parks and Recreation Committee Meeting of October 23, Jazmin LeBlanc
flatly stated that the City could not require TeamSheeper to select Rinconada Masters as the masters
subcontractor. This is incorrect as a legal matter, since the City could clearly condition award of the contract to
TeamSheeper on selection of Rinconada Masters, as it did so one year ago. Finally, it strikes me that Ms. LeBlanc’s
“doomsday scenario” of TeamSheeper walking if they are required to work with Rinconada Masters and the City shutting
down aquatic programs as a result is highly unlikely. First, it is not in TeamSheeper’s economic interest to walk. They are

                                                             2
trying to use this threat to force Rinconada Masters out, but if they are an economically rational actor then presumably
they will stay. Second, even if TeamSheeper does walk, the City can almost certainly find a replacement (despite City
Staff’s protestations), or take back running the programs itself, as the City did for many years. In short, to quote from
one of the Palo Alto online comments to a recent article on Rinconada Masters, “[t]he proper role of City Staff should be
to represent the concerns of the community to Mr. Sheeper‐‐ to be community advocates‐‐ and to make sure he irons
out issues/ creates win/ win solutions. Their role should not be to represent Mr. Sheeper to the public.”

My understanding is that TeamSheeper intends to replace Rinconada Masters with its own masters team, which, if true,
would represent a clear conflict of interest. And yet the history of TeamSheeper’s operation of the Burgess pool and
interaction with the SOLO Aquatics program there, which Tim Sheeper purportedly attempted to eliminate in favor of
programs under his direct management, gives indication that exactly this type of behavior may be taking place here.

The appropriate way forward in this situation is not to give TeamSheeper everything it wants, as some members of the
City Staff appear to favor, but rather to balance the interests of the existing Palo Alto community of Rinconada pool
users—including Rinconada Masters—with those of TeamSheeper. Collaboration will be key to finding such a balanced,
middle of the road way forward. Clearly it will take some effort for Rinconada Masters and TeamSheeper to clear the air
and figure out a way to work together. From everything I’ve seen, Rinconada Masters stands ready to make this effort. I
hope that TeamSheeper is as well—but regardless, I implore the City Council, as the body representing us Palo Altans, to
ensure that they do so.

Sincerely,

Don Williams

Thank you for the update on the flight procedure PIRAT.

I strongly urge the Council to confront the FAA in all possible ways, including
legal action, on this issue. And work with neighboring cities to strengthen
our hand, whenever it makes sense. Consider hiring specialized aviation legal
counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge areas.

Airplane noise is a big deal for my family and we must tackle this issue head‐on.

I am glad Ed Shikada has updated the Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the
actions being taken by the city staff.

Since the FAA has not previously listened to our noise issues and taken actions to
mitigate them, it is very important to challenge the FAA in the strongest and focused
way possible.

Take legal options
Work with other impacted cities, when our interests are aligned, to strengthen our
actions.
Enlist specialized aviation legal council to review PIRAT, and identify challenge areas.

Many nights I have planes over my home every 10 minutes, sometimes seems like

All, I appreciate Ed Shikada’s update to Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the actions city staff are taking to
address airplane noise. I ask the City of Palo Alto to challenge the FAA in the strongest possible way, including legal
options and to work closely with neighboring cities in order to strengthen our stance. We lost the battle over
the insanely loud music we hear from Shoreline Amphitheater because previous council members let it drag on for years
(now decades) don’t let this happen again. Don’t wait or spend time and money using consultants, step up to the plate
and take action before its too late.

Subject:             PIRAT --planned FAA procedure for western (a.k.a. Oceanic) arrivals for SFO and OAK airports



Dear City Council Members,

I very much appreciate your support and the efforts of City management and staff to address the major
airplane noise problem that Palo Alto residents continue to endure since the first official implementation of
NextGen over 3.5 years ago. It was great in particular to hear Ed Shikada provide an update to Council on the
planned PIRAT procedure.

Regarding PIRAT, I urge the City to challenge the FAA proposal. The FAA has not done a proper environmental
review even though the procedure will definitely shift more traffic over mid‐Peninsula cities, and in particular
Palo Alto:

       today western arrivals to OAK typically fly across the peninsula at the level of the San Mateo bridge.
        PIRAT will bring these arrivals to the level of the Dumbarton bridge. PIRAT shifts ground paths.
       western arrivals are particularly disturbing to residents because several occur between 4 and 5 AM
        while residents try to sleep.
       PIRAT is an OPD (Optimized Profile Descent) that will concentrate traffic over a very narrow
        corridor. We all very well know what OPDs do regarding noise on the ground. Look at SERFR.

Furthermore, the proposed procedure is in complete contradiction with the FAA repeated statement that they
do not shift noise. Shifting ground paths will shift noise.

Specifically, I would like to request that the City

       engage specialized aviation legal counsel to identify all viable arguments for the PIRAT procedure that could be
        used to challenge the FAA in court.
       pursue legal action against the FAA if reasonable legal grounds exist ‐‐cities who have pursued litigation against
        the FAA seem to be getting more results than we do.
       collaborate with other potentially impacted Cities ‐‐there is strength in numbers.
       update and seek Council's input before making strategic or irreversible decisions that may limit the City future
        options

Thank you again for your support and efforts on this very important matter that affects many residents, every day and
night, all year long.

Best regards,

marie‐jo fremont

Council,

Thank you for your sustained support to address the airplane noise problem experienced by your residents.

I appreciate Ed Shikada's update on the planned PIRAT procedure and the actions staff and Council are taking to address this.

PIRAT may have significant consequences including the “shifting of noise" of OCEANIC arrivals to OAK over Palo Alto. The new
procedure is an OPD (Optimized Profile Decent) which means higher concentration of flights and increased noise. The net is
more airplane noise moved to Palo Alto.

To avoid miscues and to ensure the City challenges the FAA in the strongest way possible, please provide the original
consultant’s analysis to and receive Council's input before making binding and irrevocable decisions that limit future options.
If applicable, all or some of these materials may need to be confidential versus publicly available. Take appropriate legal
options if it is determined there is a strong position based on the specialized legal aviation counsel’s review and inclusion of all
viable challenge areas to PIRAT. This procedure will likely impact several cities and Palo Alto should proactively work with
them where our interests are aligned and to strengthen the overall position. A regional or multi‐city approach may be what is
needed to address the regional NextGen problem.

It is reassuring that technical and legal consultants are engaged and that the City is working towards the 11/13 comment
period deadline. This also prepares the City to address the 60 day deadline for actions if so determined as part of its Fast Track
process.

Thank you,
Darlene Yaplee

Subject:            Rinconada Masters Swimming




       Greetings Council Members,

       My name is Chris Kanazawa and I grew up in Palo Alto, moved away for college, and returned in 1991 at
       which point I started swimming with the Rinconada Masters program. I have swum with the program
       continuously since that time.

       I urge you to reconsider the aquatics contract that is currently under review, which would award Team
       Sheeper complete control of the Rinconada Pool. The contract would allow Sheeper to bring in his own
       Masters team (which of course means more money for him) instead of renewing Rinconada Masters
       subcontract (which he has already stated he will not do). The Rinconada Masters team has a rich history
       and is one of the original masters swim programs on the peninsula. Our team consists of young and old,
       ex olympians and novices, national champions and non‐competitive swimmers. We have two excellent
       coaches, Carol MacPherson and Terri Baxter, who encourage and help us with all aspects of our
       swimming lives. They keep us motivated and engaged. The only reason Sheeper could possibly have to
       get rid of our team, is to bring in his own team and increase his profits. This would be a shame since
       Rinconada is a community pool and the city of Palo Alto (and hence us taxpayers) pays for its heating
       and maintenance. We do not need another Team Sheeper Masters program, there is already one in
       Menlo Park.

       I am also including, below, one of the comments from the the Palo Alto online story regarding this issue.
       If history is any indication, we should be worried about this takeover. It appears to be written by a
       Menlo Park resident who has witnessed first hand the way it all played out for them. It should be noted
       that Sheeper was already running the Menlo Masters program so had no need to eliminate that, just the
       SOLO youth swim team.
       ———————————————

       It might be helpful to provide Palo Alto residents with a few lessons learned from Tim Sheeper taking
       over the operation of Burgess Pool in Menlo Park.

       First, City Staff should not be the mouthpiece of Mr. Sheeper and the media should insist on speaking to
       him directly about his decisions. In Menlo Park, Mr. Sheeper was successful in not directly defending his
       decisions and ascribing that role to Cherise Brandell/ City Staff. The proper role of City Staff should be to
       represent the concerns of the community to Mr. Sheeper‐‐ to be community advocates‐‐ and to make
       sure he irons out issues/ creates win/ win solutions. Their role should not be to represent Mr. Sheeper
       to the public.

       Second, Palo Alto is in a difficult situation in that they put out an RFP and had only Mr. Sheeper
       responding. Once the third party Rinc Masters program is eliminated / taken over by Mr. Sheeper, the
       city will be even more dependent on him for his services. Palo Alto could be more creative in looking for
       a service provider; recall that Menlo Park never initially put out an RFP for Burgess Pool‐‐ the city simply
       asked Mr. Sheeper if he would like to run it. (Which to his credit, he successfully created a model for. He
       did not have an example to look to.) Palo Alto could create a new Tim Sheeper‐‐ find a private
                                                             9
coordinator who manages the different service providers (e.g. the lesson program could be offered to
Kings Academy and Masters and Swim Team already exist). The city could approach Stanford for ideas
on how their SCRA facility was run with the help of PASA for programming. Tim Sheeper does a good job
at providing services; the problems come when he has the monopoly and uses that to eliminate beloved
community programs and create problems between user groups.

To that previous point, a third lesson from Burgess is that it is important that community user groups
are brought together to cooperate. Unfortunately, in Menlo Park, there are examples of Mr. Sheeper
pitting user groups against one another to help facilitate the elimination process. For example, during
his attempt to eliminate SOLO Aquatics from Burgess, he posted fliers on all of the doors alerting lap
swimmers that SOLO was attempting to eliminate their lap swimming time and urging lap swimmers to
protest that. The result included on‐deck issues of lap swimmers yelling at swim team families (I
witnessed one first hand.) If lap swimmers in Palo Alto are feeling they need lanes during Master swim
times, then the Masters need to cooperate to provide some lanes. Mr. Sheeper’s role should be to
facilitate that process. If he cannot, then the City should reconsider if he is the best service provider for
Palo Alto.

Given that safety concerns seem like they could be easily addressed by requiring Rinconada Masters to
hire an extra lifeguard, the taking over of the Rinconada Masters program seems to be most likely about
money. In Menlo Park, Menlo Masters participation costs between $85 ‐ $185 a month depending on
the membership level. Multiply an average cost by twelve and by hundreds of swimmers and it is clear;
Mr. Sheeper makes a great deal more money by running the program himself with only the hourly cost
of lifeguards and coaches. His supporters routinely point out that he is a businessman and this is simply
good business. This would be a fair point if Mr. Sheeper had built the pools. However, the pools are built
and maintained by the city residents, and this is a public / private partnership, not a private business
opportunity in which he took the risk of building a sports facility like SportsHouse. Priority should
therefore be given to the community groups who are historically based and beloved by the city.

What to do?

Concerned Palo Alto residents need to get individual city council members to understand what is going
on. Only through vocal outpouring in Menlo Park was the City Council able to incorporate some level of
protection for SOLO Aquatics in Mr. Sheepers contract. The City Council directs City Staff, and therefore
concerned residents need to make their voices heard to the council.

Dear City Council;

Low and loud air traffic already interrupts our sleep. We have lost the peace in our yards and homes; even with the

Dear City of Palo Alto Council Members:

I was so happy to hear Ed Shikada’s update to the Council on 10/29/18 regarding the City staff addressing the FAA’s
planned PIRAT procedure. I was so happy that he was aware that it is a time sensitive item with a deadline of November
13, 2018, and that he stated that staff is following up with technical consultants and legal counsel. Given the possible
negative impact of PIRAT on the citizens of Palo Alto, I urge the Council members to make sure the City of Palo Alto
challenges the FAA to take PIRAT to a higher level of review. The City of Palo must:
     Take appropriate legal action to ensure the FAA focuses on the noise and pollution impact of the current and
        proposed flight patterns and includes an environmental review process in proposed changes like the PIRAT
        procedure
     Work with nearby potentially impacted cities to strengthen input to the FAA regarding the PIRAT proposed
     Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge areas
     Require that the FAA provide updates to the Council and receive the Council’s input before making binding and
        irrevocable decisions that limit future options.

Thank you so much for your continued attention to addressing the unconscionable airplane noise problem in our city.

I appreciate Ed Shikada’s update to Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the actions city staff are taking to address airplane
noise. I heard these new large flights yesterday evening, every few minutes, and was not excited about it :(

(Just as I'm writing this, there is one at 3800 feet overhead, but it's from Portland into SFO.)

I'm probably one of the few people who paid attention to airplane noise before I bought a house here about nine years ago, and I
am pretty upset about what has happened to our skies. We cannot enjoy open windows much of the time now.

Please put some teeth into our complaints. I am all for legal actions ‐‐ I'm not sure what else can really get their attention. And do
collaborate with other cities who are also impacted, and rely on experts who can identify options for us.

Thank you,

‐‐ Sherry Listgarten.

Subject:             PIRAT


Dear Councilmembers:

It was with great dismay that I learned about the changes to shift the PIRAT flight path south, over Palo Alto. We are
already inundated with airplane noise over our Green Acres neighborhood. Something must be done to stop the
intrusive noise caused by these flight paths.

The FAA must be challenged:

       with any available legal options the city may have
       with help from other cities that share our concerns
       with the help of legal experts who specialize in aviation
       with transparency to the public.

For the FAA to implement changes to flight paths while completely ignoring the communities that are impacted by them
is just wrong. We can't let these changes go unchallenged.

I understand there is a "comment period" deadline of November 13th. Please don't let this opportunity pass us by.

Thank you,
Yolanda Scheffold

Please make sure that city staff is taking action to address airplane noise. Because of the city’s previous experience,
please pay attention to your residents and challenge the FAA as strongly as possible. It seems appropriate that you:


       Sue the FAA ‐ follow examples of Phoenix and other cities who have had success using legal actions to change
        NextGen airplane noise impacts
       Contract with expert aviation legal counsel to review FAA process and the new PIRAT route ‐ challenge them in
        every way you can to protect the city’s and region’s residents from aircraft noise pollution
       Collaborate with other cities who are also suffering from the changed aircraft routes
       Don’t make any decisions that impact future options for City Council actions



I am so tired and worn down by the constant airplane noise directly over my house, day and night, destroying
my sleep and ruining my quality of life.

Thanks,

In case you somehow hadn’t noticed or been bothered by the airplane noise yourself...

noise.

Based on Palo Alto’s previous experiences and to avoid omissions I ask the City to challenge the FAA in the strongest possible way,

Which last avenue seems most promising…given that the arrogant FAA has shown itself completely obdurate one this issue.

Dear Council,


Thanks so much to Ed Shikada for initiating timely and meaningful action related to the FAA’s new PIRAT
route proposal.


We have been left taking the lion’s share of the aircraft noise so many times in the past that it is wonderful to
see Council approaching this aggressively.


I respectfully request that Council:


- Take all appropriate legal action related to PIRAT. We need to know in detail how it will affect us.
- Work with other nearby cities who understand the importance of sharing the noise burden.
- Continue to work with specialized legal counsel.
- Continue to monitor FAA proposed actions and be prepared to react promptly to changes.


Thank you again for helping with this.

Hi,
I live in Palo Alto in Barron Park. We have a low flying, deafeningly loud jet passing over our home every 2 minutes on
average. They fly so low that being in the backyard is traumatizing so I don't go outside in the back anymore.

When the planes pass over my home I can identify the airline and see the windows and other small airplane parts which
one should not be able to see from the ground when not on a runway. I have developed tinnitus from the jet noise. The
jets are supposed to stop during the night but they wake me from sleep in the night, wake me in the morning, and I can't
go to sleep without earplugs. I can't leave the window open on warm nights and don't generally open them during the
day anymore due to the plane noise. When my husband I go for a walk in the neighborhood a plane passes over
deafeningly loud and easy to see up close and personal every two minutes. We have to hold our ears.

The quality of life in Palo Alto has plummeted due to the jet noise that suddenly showed up in this way from one day to
the next several years ago. Before that I don't think I ever gave airplane noise a thought at all. I'm not a general
complainer. I don't care about traffic, parking, construction in Palo Alto. This is a nice place to live. For me, the
predominant and overarching issue has become unrelenting jet noise which shatters my life and shatters the peace for
my family and neighbors every single day.

I'd like to know what action you plan to take to protect the health and well being of our community. I work a few miles
south in Los Altos and it is nowhere near as low and deafeningly loud there. It feels like my neighborhood or South Palo
Alto has been sacrificed.

Waiting to hear back,

Hayyah Muller, M.D.

Dear City Council,

flying over Palo Alto, they find that instead of using the patio, they have their windows closed all the time and are using the air

Subject: PIRAT

I appreciate Ed Shikada’s update to Council on the planned PIRAT procedure, and the actions city staff
are taking to address airplane noise.
Based on Palo Alto’s previous experiences and to avoid omissions I ask the City to challenge the FAA in
the strongest possible way, including:


       Take appropriate legal options, if any
       Work with other potentially impacted Cities (when interests are aligned) in order to strengthen the
        actions
       Enlist specialized aviation legal counsel to review PIRAT and identify all viable challenge areas

     *Provide updates to and receive Council's input before making binding and irrevocable decisions that
limit future options.

With the increase in noise including air traffic, these measures are necessary to help keep Palo Alto livable and desirable
place to live.
Thank You,
Barbara Millin

Hello City Council. I am writing about a new route, PIRAT, that is apparently being established over
south Palo Alto. I understand that the large oceanic flights used to go into the bay on a route farther
north, but now the FAA is planning to direct these farther south over Palo Alto. Here is the info I
received about it, via my Greenmeadow neighborhood group, see below. I ask that you to take action
against this change There is an 11/13 comments deadline. Thank you.

I would like Palo Alto to challenge the FAA in the strongest ways possible regarding PIRAT.
That would include working with other potentially impacted cities, getting specialized aviation legal counsel to
review PIRAT and to determine all possible and viable areas to challenge, and finally to take appropriate legal
actions.

Palo Alto city council members,

The following is a copy of a previous letter to the city council sent a couple of years ago. I
feel that the problems have only worsened since and I have not seen anything to make me
believe that the city is taking an aggressive approach to this issue.

are taking to address airplane noise.

My family has lived and worked in Palo Alto since 1954. To say the changes have been
dramatic would be an understatement. Some of these changes were inevitable, some were
beneficial, others not so much.

 We were the owners of the Village Cheese House from 1959 until 2008 and have had the
wonderful experience of knowing many generations of thousands of families as the years
passed by. I attended Fairmeadow, Wilbur and Cubberly, our three kids El Carmelo, Jane
Lathrop, and Paly. So I think we have a fairly good perspective of the the issues that effect
life here in Palo Alto.

It may sound like an exaggeration but I feel that the jet noise issue is one the most
important and urgent problems to have affected the city in all our years of living here. The
incessant cacophony of roaring, screeching, whining, whooshing sounds that are assaulting
us all day and all night are ruining our sleep, health, and general enjoyment of life. One,
two, sometimes three jets at a time are crossing directly over our heads at all times. Most of
the people that live here do not have central air conditioning and depend on leaving doors
and windows open to take advantage of the beautiful weather we are blessed with.

As I laid in bed last night between 11:00 - 12:30 pm no less than 35 planes not only
prevented me from going to sleep but I’m sure raised my already fragile blood pressure to
                                                         1
levels that were not conducive to my well being. This happens almost EVERY NIGHT since
next gen has been put into effect !!

 I belong to sky posse and have attended almost all the meetings and the FAA completely
ignores the fact that Palo Alto is the most affected city and offers absolutely no relief. In fact
we are being informed that current proposed changes WILL MAKE IT WORSE. Even if the
noise doesn’t ruin our lives here in Palo Alto the health effects on all of us and especially
our children who remain in the city all day long is in jeopardy. These planes are spewing
unburnt jet fuel all over our city much like the days of old when we had to stay indoors
while helicopters flew back and forth a few feet above the rooftops, like a scene from
Apocalypse Now, spraying insecticides for the Mediterranean fruit fly. I told you I go way
back.The pollution falling directly on to us is probably greater than any other source.

The fact that no one from Palo Alto is on the select committee is not only a slap in the face
to us all but should be investigated to the fullest.



I BEG YOU TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO STOP THIS ! I AM AT WITS END ! There
must be a legal remedy that the city could pursue, Please.



Thank You.

Richard, Claudine, Bernetta, Cynthia, Jeff, Anne, Staehnke

Subject:              Plastic blight at the top of Arastradero Open Space Preserve


To the Palo Alto City Council,

  Re the private estate being constructed above Arastradero Open Space Preserve,
that the City Council under Mayor Greg Scharff unanimously voted to approve in 2017 :

There is a vast slope of plastic sheeting, fencing and other equipment highly visible
from Meadowlark Trail, from the top of Acorn Trail, from the panoramic viewpoint area,
and also from the picnic table by the horse hitching post up there.

=> See photos below, taken yesterday November 1.

This plastic sheeting has been in place for many months now.

Whether or not the plastic is temporary and is to promote seeding or landscaping
(possibly to hold the slope soil in place ?), it is, and has been, an enormous eyesore to hikers.

That slope has probably held itself up for centuries with the help of native grasses and oak trees.

Does this plastic-covered slope conform to city codes, with respect to
visual impact on an open space park and its popular trails ?

Please, is this visual blight on our park squared with the city's laws ?

Thank you,

               Dan‐ I sent the email below to three TV stations here yesterday and I watched the news at 11 here
         today to see if they reported the HSR Station District meeting to their viewers. I watched Ch. 30 ABC
         until 11:50 AM and not one word was spoken about it.

               I swung over to Ch. 24, the NBC affiliate in Fresno. At 11:15 AM, they reported the meeting, gave
         the time and location, but then the male anchor yelled this: He may have a high school diploma, and so,
         to make the rich Republican station owners, his scumbag employers, happy, he yelled "They've been
         working on this project for years, so it'll be interesting to see what they do there". The equally qualified
         female anchor sitting next to him then smiled in total agreement with this slur, like she knows how
         corrupt and wrong the high speed rail authority really is. What he said there was not in the copy he was
         reading, but the station owners are fine with him slandering high speed rail with this editorializing. Ch.
         24 should lose its broadcast license for this crap. They encourage the morons they hire to read the news
         to slander HSR at every opportunity, and this fuels the opposition to HSR among the ignorant here.

              So there you have it. The rich Republican scum who own the TV stations in corrupt little Fresno do
         all in their power to stop high speed rail in California. I guess Fresno has been famous for corruption for
         a very long time, and you see it in their fight to stop HSR. This is a corrupt little burg, but then somebody
         with your long experience in California politics would know that. I moved here in 2000, and it took me a
         while to catch on.

               Keep 'em broke, barefoot and pregnant. Do all in your power to keep them exploited. High speed
         rail coming through Fresno will start to threaten that, and they don't want it.

     Mr. Dan Richard
     Chairman of the Board of Directors
     California High Speed Rail Authority

     Dan‐ Here is information from "Morning Roundup" today in Fresno. I may attend this re the
Fresno HSR Station District. City people and HSR people will be there, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, with two
presentations.



      http://fresnostationdistrict.org/About%20the%20Project.html

            I'm all for this, and I think HSR will be a huge boost for Fresno. Fresno is of two minds on
HSR though. The "word on the street" (among people here who have barely heard of Silicon Valley) is
that HSR is a boondoggle, a huge waste of money, and will never get built. That mind set is provoked
and maintained by the rich Republicans who own the local TV stations here. Fresno, 165 miles from
Palo Alto, might just as well be in west Texas. Actually, HSR is Fresno's only hope of entering the 20th
century.

                                                    2
      So is that not odd? Local politicians see some minor potential for Fresno in being 45 minutes
from Palo Alto and 1 hour 20 minutes from San Francisco (!), but the rich Republican TV station owners,
who must be their pals, do all they can, abusing their broadcast license, to subvert the project.

       Despite all of that, everyone in Fresno seems to want the HMF here. That is the one thing about
HSR that many here feel would be transformative for Fresno. It would indeed be, but they are missing
the bigger picture.

       I hope that the new Fresno station will be easy for self driving vans and buses to get to, probably
via Hwy. 41, from thousands of new homes west of 99 for the highly educated, high income SV types
who will commute in here on HSR. HSR and City officials should work to make that possible. The Fresno
station will need loading areas or even ramps to accommodate this traffic in the morning and evening.
A LOT of Uber and Lyft traffic and lots of these buses and vans will frequent your new Fresno station,
and you probably won't need a lot of long‐term parking space, if any. With ride hailing, why would
anyone local drive to the station and pay to park his car all day? I'm sure the station planners at HSR
are on to that.

         As you have heard, Waymo by Google has now been granted permission to operate self driving
vehicles on public streets in California without a driver on board. For sure, when HSR starts running in
Fresno, such vehicles will transport HSR riders around Fresno to and from the station. That, BTW, will
be a huge boon for HSR. Not having to pay to park a car all day, and having to put it at risk, will
stimulate ridership on HSR. Again, you won't need loads of parking at your HSR stations. That was a
fear of Palo Alto officials re having a HSR station at the current Caltrain station at Alma Street, and I
think they vetoed such a station because of that. There is not much space for parking at that station
and they cited that in declining a HSR stop. Perhaps they can reconsider since they won't need parking
there. The Alma St. station is the station for Stanford University, and to have HSR skip that just seems
wrong‐headed. "Sorry, you can't get to the Stanford campus directly via HSR. You have to get off in
Redwood City or something".

     I will be most interested in what they say and show tomorrow at the meeting in Fresno. I hope
your people there talk a LOT about thousands of high income Silicon Valley employees commuting to
Fresno in 45 minutes on HSR, and Fresnans commuting up there for good jobs. It will double home
values here and then double them again. Avg. price for a house in San Jose is now $1 million. In 1955,
we bought a big, new house in Willow Glen, 3 bed, two baths, big living room with a fireplace, and a big
family room with another fireplace, for $17,000. I watched them build it. That is when California's
schools were #1 in the U.S.

        So again, I hope your people tomorrow don't just focus on the station and the quarter mile
around it. The bigger story by far is what HSR will mean for backward, poor little Fresno, the poorest
big city in California. Even beyond Fresno since HSR would enable SV to throw up big production
facilities in the Central Valley. It will bend out those blinders, help break the strangle‐hold the
Republicans have here, and give Fresnans access to the riches of Silicon Valley, through employment
there, and here. And easy access to San Francisco. And, when you build south of Bakersfield, the same
access to Los Angeles. All of that will be transformative. In past information meetings in the Central
Valley, and I attended ~7 of them, none of that was ever mentioned. Please send the word to your
people who will be on hand tomorrow, that that larger story is the one Fresnans need to know about. A
cohort of richer, far better educated, non‐violent, law abiding Silicon Valley people joining the Fresno
ecosystem. That gentrification will help drive out the scum who prey so freely on Fresno now. I saw
that happen in East Palo Alto in the late eighties.

      Thank you for the presentation tomorrow in Fresno.

Subject:             Rinconada Pool - New Fee




Dear Mayor Kniss and City Council members,

Last week I spoke at the open session about Team Sheeper's bid to replace Carol McPherson's Master Swim program
with one of his own. I noted my personal desire to keep Carol and her "Swim for Fitness" program (because of my
special needs son who is finally learning to swim).

To be clear, I am happy with how Team Sheeper runs the Rinconada pool in most regards. The life guards are pleasant,
helpful and the facilities (maintained by the city) are as good as I've ever seen in my 40+ years of swimming at Rinc.

However, there is one issue which seems to be mostly overlooked. Swimmer friends that I know are not aware of this...

Team Sheeper will increase the daily swim fees

 AND

add an ANNUAL fee of $50.

I believe an annual fee would be prohibitive and exclusionary. Many of us appreciated Mayor Kniss' remarks last week
following the Pittsburgh Synagogue massacre, highlighting Palo Alto's desire to be a welcoming and open city. Team
Sheeper's plan to charge an annual fee flies in the face of those comments. It would seriously impact or exclude many
of the people who use Rinconada pool for a limited time over the summer months. An annual fee feels like an exclusive
club, with intention to keep out the riff‐raff. Last I checked, Rinconada was a public pool. Let's keep it that way,
please. As other people have commented, Palo Alto is already paying for the maintenance of the facility. I understand
Team Sheeper needs to make a living, but do we have to limit the pool to only people who happen to be wealthy
enough? Doesn't seem fair, or feel like the Palo Alto Mayor Kniss described.

Could we please work with Tim Sheeper? Could we ask him to keep on Carol and eliminate the annual fee?

Thanks for reading this,
Ann Protter

Subject:           Rinconada Masters Swimming Program - Untimely Demise



Palo Alto City Council,

While not a Palo Alto resident, I have been a Rinconada Masters Swimmer for at least 25 years. I started
swimming there when I worked in Palo Alto, and over the years have developed many close friendships with
other members of the team.

Swimming has been an important part of my life for 60 years, starting with swimming and water polo when I
was in high school, followed by the same activities while I was at Stanford, and picked up again later in life
with Rinconada Masters. While I was young (I am currently 76), I focused on the competitive aspects of the
water. Now, I look at swimming as the mainstay of my physical and mental health. It is fantastic for keeping
the body and mind healthy, and is an excellent stress reliever.

With that as background, I want to note that as a non-resident, I can choose to swim with any masters program
in the peninsula. So, if some dire situation should arise that drove me away from Rinconada Masters, I will find
other places to swim. I would be sorry to see that happen, because as I look around at other programs, I see that
the Rinconada program, besides from being an historical legacy as being one of the founding masters programs
on the peninsula, it has one of the best programs for people like me, who want to stay healthy in both mind and
spirit. It has the best number of workouts that fit the needs of its diverse swimming community of working
professionals, and retired citizens. It's workouts are also attuned to that same diverse community. Based on
Team Sheeper's workout schedules at
Burgess pool, I am sure this kind of scheduling will no longer exist.

I share the concern of our members, and those of the Lap-Swimming community, as well, that should Team
Sheeper be allowed to take over complete control of the Rinconada pool and its programs, this treasure of a
program will eventually disappear. My concerns have
been raised by how I have viewed the transition of the Burgess pool over the past few years.

I was originally quite impressed with how Team Sheeper transformed Menlo Park's pool into a thriving
enterprise filled with a variety of activities including a masters program and lap swimming. As time passed I
have seen more profitable activities take over the pool
while access to the pool for the masters program and lap swimming has diminished. I assume this is because
the other programs are more profitable.

While I have no problem with a private enterprise making a reasonable profit, I do have a concern about that
being done at the cost of a public resource, such as the Rinconada Pool, whose mission should be to provide a
service to the public, rather than simply be a revenue source for a private enterprise.

I am also concerned that some of Team Sheeper's justifications for replacing the current Rinconada masters
program with a different program, perhaps even his own, are quite flimsy. As I understand some of Team
Sheeper's complaints: Rinconada has not communicated well with it; Rinconada has not provided adequate life
guards; and Rinconada has not shown respect to Team Sheeper. While I am not personally involved with these
issues, it seems unlikely to me that after working successfully with the City of Palo Alto for several decades
                                                        1
where these issues were non-existent, that they should suddenly appear when Team Sheeper came into the
picture. I hope you and your staff
have thoroughly investigated those issues, and determined their veracity/accuracy.

Thank you for your time in reading my letter and investing your time on this issue. I hope the City Council will
continue to look deeply into this issue and make sure, before taking any final action, that there is ample
justification for ending its successful relationship
with the Rinconada Masters Program.

Subject:          Future of the Rinconada Masters



To the Palo Alto City Council:

As elected officials, you have been temporarily granted and entrusted with certain
powers that the rest of us do not have. One of these is the sole right to determine the
future of the Rinconada Masters -- whether you will allow us to continue as a
venerable Palo Alto institution or whether you will consign us to oblivion. The
decision is in your hands.

In 1973, Palo Alto had the foresight to institute the Rinconada Masters, one of the
first adult swimming training programs of its kind in the entire United States. We
swimmers sincerely hope that the legacy of this city council will be to prevent the
destruction of what your predecessors had the wisdom to create.

Subject:           Comment on the Riconada Pool Contract



Dear City Counsel,
I feel compelled to write to you about the Rinconada pool after reading the article in the Palo Alto Weekly
entitled “Rinconada Masters may be forced out of the pool.”
(https://paloaltoonline.com/news/2018/10/24/rinconada-masters-may-be-forced-out-of-the-pool)
I was a bit disturbed by indication in this article that the point of view of a Rinconada Masters team was the
main voice being heard by the City Counsel and want to make sure that other voices are also heard.
The article mentioned that Menlo Park-based Team Sheeper is negotiating a new five-year deal with the city to
manage the Rinconada. I want to voice my support for Team Sheeper and the idea of them managing the pool
for the next 5 years.
My view, when thinking about the Rinconada pool is that we need to consider 3 main values, Safety, Full
Utilization, and Inclusion. I think that Team Sheeper is our best bet for making sure each of those values are
held.
First, I think that safety is the most important thing and anyone utilizing the pool, with no exception, must
always follow the recommendations of the independent aquatics expert who identified the need to have two
lifeguards around the pool, with at least one on deck. There is no justification for shortchanging safety.
Second, I applaud what Team Sheeper has done to allow for better utilization of the pool. When I first moved
here, it was impossible to find easy consistent times to lap swim, there were no swim lessons for kids on the
weekends, and no swim summer camps. I am delighted by how much more the pool is being used and for how
much more of the year it is being used. Frankly, we went to Menlo Park for many pool services, because
Rinconada, a valuable local resource, was not easily accessible. I think we are on the right track in now having
a full set of programs in place and I love that my daughter was able to go to a summer swim camp in Palo Alto,
instead of the only option being Menlo Park.
Finally, we do need to consider inclusion. Everyone, from kids to masters, must have a place. The specifics do
not need to stay the same, but everyone should have some accommodation. The article mentioned that a
master’s program will continue. Times change, and it is sad when things change, but no one is entitled to
everything remaining identically to how it was always done, particularly at a community resource. It appears
Team Sheeper will include something for everyone, and something for more people, which is what I want to
see.
As a homeowner and resident for the last 11 years, I want to applaud the Parks and Recreation staff for finally
recognizing that they could not effectively utilize the Rinconada pool and that they needed help. I think the
solution being reviewed, a long-term contract with Team Sheeper, is the right direction for our city.
Thank you for considering my option.

Subject:             Tax Bases


Has the council ever considered way to extract revenue from remodeling/residential building projects? Compared to
when I was growing up, traffic law enforcement is almost nonexistent, permit parking enforcement is nonexistent ‐ I
know because I just tried and failed to get it enforced; pool, animal services and street sweeping have been contracted
out. Our city services are barely managing to survive, yet we live in possibly the wealthiest community in the country.
Where’s all the money going? Into houses. If someone has enough spare change to spend $5million on a “remodel,”
you’d think there’d be a way to slap a tax on that.

People swarm to Palo Alto for it’s “quality of life,” and then refuse to understand they have an obligation to support that
quality. Any time council wants to step up and help them make that connection would be good with me.

According to the Daily Post (Nov 3‐4), your group and the CA Apartment Association have contributed $$ to Cormack’s
city council campaign.

What sleaze.

Keep your nose out of our politics.

Subject:          Vote YES On Prop 12 ~ Be The Voice for Animals!




             With Proposition 12, California voters face choices
                      on farm animal confinement.

                            Measures like Prop 12 are crucial,
                      since not a single federal law protects animals
                            during their lives at factory farms.




           To understand what Proposition 12 means for farm animals, it
              helps to understand a ballot measure California voters
                             approved 10 years ago.



                                                    1
That was Proposition 2, which banned the confinement of veal,
 pigs, and egg‐laying hens in spaces too small to allow animals
 to turn around, lie down, or stand up and extend their limbs.
    But that measure didn't set specific space requirements.
                  Prop. 12 would do just that.

    This is your opportunity to "be the voice" for animals.
                  Vote YES on Proposition 12.
