                    City of Palo Alto                                          (ID # 9463)
                    City Council Staff Report

Report Type: Informational Report                 Meeting Date: 11/5/2018

Summary Title: CAPER for the CDBG Program for FY 2017

Title: Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) for
the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program for Fiscal Year
2017

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Planning and Community Environment


Recommendation
This is an informational report and no Council action is required.

Background
The preparation and submittal of a Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report
(CAPER) is a requirement of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for
the receipt of Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. The attached
document, Attachment A, was submitted to HUD on September 28, 2018, following the
required 15-day public review period. It is being provided to the Council for informational
purposes only.

Discussion
This CAPER represents the third year of the City’s Five-Year Consolidated plan covering the
period 2015-2020 and summarizes the accomplishments under the CDBG program for the
period July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. As required, the CAPER consists of specific program
narratives, an assessment of annual performance, and an assessment of progress toward
meeting goals and objectives contained in the Consolidated Plan.

Finally, this CAPER summary report is intended to inform the public on how the CDBG funds
administered by the City of Palo Alto during the 2017-18 Fiscal Year have been expended and
describes the extent to which the purposes of the grant program have been carried out. The
amount funded to specific activities is reported the year they are funded. However, due to the



City of Palo Alto                                                                       Page 1
nature of certain projects, it is common for projects to overlap program years and
accomplishments are reported when the project has been completed and in some cases when
the units become occupied.

Summary of Accomplishments
CDBG funds were used for public services and economic development activities. Palo Alto has
five primary CDBG program activity areas in which to allocate funds: Public Services, Planning
and Administration, Economic Development, Housing, and Public Facilities. Funds were
allocated in accordance with the goals and objectives set forth in the 2015-2020 Consolidated
Plan. The major accomplishments include the following:

    •    Continued implementation of the Workforce Development Program which led to 32
         previously unemployed individuals reentering the workforce;
    •    Assisted 20 individuals in investigating their fair housing complaints
    •    Services received by 614 homeless individuals at the Opportunity Services Center
    •    Assisted 369 seniors in Long-Term Care
    •    Services were provided to 142 persons through the SRO Resident Support Program by
         Palo Alto Housing
    •    Assisted 6 people with domestic violence services; and
    •    Improved access to 130 persons to decent affordable housing.

Attachment A, provides a detailed description of the various programs and project
accomplishments within the fiscal year.


Resource Impact
The total investment of CDBG funds in Palo Alto approved for Fiscal Year 2017-18 was
$901,415. Of this amount, $85,014 was directed to public service activities, $336,400 for
Economic Development, $365,529 for housing and public facilities rehabilitation, $32,012 for
Fair Housing Services, and $82,460 was allocated for administration activities.

Environmental Review
For purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), this action itself is not a project; therefore, no environmental impact
assessment is necessary.

CR-05 - Goals and Outcomes
Progress the jurisdiction has made in carrying out its strategic plan and its action plan. 91.520(a)

Below is a description of the progress the City of Palo Alto has made in achieving the goals outlined in its strategic plan and annual action. In
fiscal year 2017-18, the City achieved the majority of its annual goals & is on track to meet most of the five year goals outlined in the
Consolidated Plan.

Unforunately, due to factors outside of the City’s control, the City did not meet the Affordable Housing goal to rehabilitated 103 housing units.
The reasons are described later in this report & the City is working with its subrecipient to ensure that work on the programs moves forward.

Comparison of the proposed versus actual outcomes for each outcome measure submitted with the consolidated plan and
explain, if applicable, why progress was not made toward meeting goals and objectives. 91.520(g)

Categories, priority levels, funding sources and amounts, outcomes/objectives, goal outcome indicators, units of measure, targets, actual
outcomes/outputs, and percentage completed for each of the grantee’s program year goals.

Assess how the jurisdiction’s use of funds, particularly CDBG, addresses the priorities and specific objectives identified in the plan,
giving special attention to the highest priority activities identified.

The City of Palo Alto was able to achieve many of its goals outlined in the 2017 Action Plan and 2015-2020 Consolidated Plan. In total, the City’s
CDBG program assisted 1316 persons access needed services. Of these persons, 925 were extremely low-income, 70 were very low-income, 169
were low-income & 152 were moderate income.

The City’s subrecipient (Community Working Group/Opportunity Center Housing Development Corporation) received $220,000 in FY 17-18 to
rehabilitate 88 affordable rental units at Opportunity Center for individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. The
project encountered unexpected issues involving changes within the organization. As a result, the project was delayed and no work was
completed in FY 17-18. However, the City worked diligently with the sub-receipent over the last year to ensure that the project moves forward.
The Rehabilitation work phase began in September 2018 & is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The City will work with the
                                                                              CAPER                                          2

subreceipient to ensure that accurate accomplishment data is secured & that the information is entered into IDIS and reported to HUD.

In addition, the City of Palo allocated a total of $145,529 in CDBG funds for the Minor Home Repair Program in FY 17-18. After discussions with
the City’s HUD representative, the program was developed under the Housing Rehabilitation category. Although a number of non-profits
expressed interest when the City solicited proposals for a program administrator for the Minor Home Repair Program through its CDBG NOFA
processs in November, 2017, no applications were received.

After the initial NOFA was closed, the City staff reached out to local nonprofits regarding the program & decided to reissued a Notice of CDBG
funding availability on February 9, 2018 with completed applications due February 22, 2018. The City received one application.

Upon review of the application, the CDBG staff awarded the Minor Home Repair Program contract to Habitat for Humanity of the East Bay
(Habitat) in May 2018. Habitat has many years of experience administrating similar programs throughout the Bay Area.

Given that the Minor Home Repair Program is new, Habitat is focusing on conducting marketing and outreach to engage the community and
increase awareness of the program. Thus far, about 10 residents have contacted Habitat, of which 4 are in dialogue to complete applications and
4 have completed applications & are in the process of being verified for program approval.

Due to the factors described, the City did not meet its annual goal of providing repair assistance to 15 households in FY 17-18. The City and
Habitat will work diligently to serve as many income qualified households as possible in FY 18-19 in hopes of achieving the annual goal.

Narrative

The City considers the provisions of all types of housing assistance on a citywide basis consistent with
the policies of the Comprehensive Plan. Palo Alto does not have specific target areas for housing
activities; instead the City attempts to provide housing affordable to lower-income persons throughout
the City.

Minority concentration includes areas in the City where the concentration of racial and ethnic minority
population is 10% or higher than their total citywide representation. There are only a few areas that are
considered to have a concentration of minority populations or low-income residents in Palo Alto. The
CDBG Program defines low-income concentration as any census block group where 51% or more
residents earn 80% of MFI or less. An exception exists for a jurisdiction that does not have any areas
meeting this definition, such as Palo Alto, which includes the highest quartile of all areas in the City in
terms of degree of concentration, is used. However, Palo Alto does not qualify activities under the LMI
area benefit category.




                                                                                                           5
Leveraging

Explain how federal funds leveraged additional resources (private, state and local funds),
including a description of how matching requirements were satisfied, as well as how any
publicly owned land or property located within the jurisdiction that were used to address the
needs identified in the plan.

Palo Alto leverages federal & private housing funds to the greatest extent feasible consistent
with the goals identified in the 2015-2020 Consolidated Plan. Moreover, the City continues to
encourage non-profit organizations to seek other local, state, & federal funding for both
housing & non-housing community development activities.

HSRAP: The City of Palo Alto provided $ 1,464,146 General Funds during fiscal year 2017-2018
to address primary human service needs in the community. These funds include multi-year
agreements with others allocated by HSRAP and administered by the Office of Human Services
in the Community Services Department. Funded projects addressed the Human Relations
Commission’s priority needs in the following categories: early child care and education, youth
programs, senior nutrition and social services, homelessness, and basic needs such as health
care and mental health. Additionally, a total of $65,000 was allocated to Project Sentinel and
$50,000 to Youth Community Services for Youth Connectiveness in addition to the $1464,146
General Funds during fiscal year 2017-18.

HOUSING IN-LIEU: The City of Palo Alto maintains a local housing fund consisting of two sub-
funds: the “Commercial Housing Fund” and the “Residential Housing Fund.” Palo Alto, under
Chapter 16.65 of the Municipal Code, requires commercial and industrial development projects
to pay a housing mitigation fee. The fees are deposited in the “Commercial Housing Fund”, and
the accumulated fees and interest earned on the fund are made available for the creation of
new low and moderate-income housing units under the “Affordable Housing Fund Guidelines”
adopted by the City Council. As of June 30, 2018, the Commercial Housing Fund had an
available balance of approximately $6,485,545.

Pursuant to Program H-3.1.2, the Below Market Rate Program of the City’s Housing Element,
Palo Alto collects housing in-lieu fees from residential development when it is infeasible to
provide below market rate units on-site. These fees, along with interest earnings of the Fund
and other miscellaneous revenues related to housing, are placed in a special fund; “the
Residential Housing Fund”. This fund is used to provide funding for acquisition or rehabilitation
of low and moderate-income housing, but may also be used for assistance to new housing
construction projects. As of June 30, 2018, the Residential Housing fund had an available
balance of approximately $4,369,274.
                                                                                                 6
These are the only local sources of funding and subsidies available for affordable housing within
the City. They are used to provide matching funds, pay for expenses which exceed HUD income
and cost limits, to fund the cost of features and amenities classified as ineligible under federal
housing programs, pre-development expenses, feasibility studies, site acquisition, and other
similar purposes.

Discuss the difference between goals and outcomes and problems encountered in meeting
these goals.

As mentioned previously, the City’s subrecipient, Community Working Group/Opportunity Center
Housing Development Corporation, received $220,000 in FY 2017-18 to rehabilitate 88 affordable rental
units at Opportunity Center for individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of becoming
homeless. The project encountered unexpected issues involving changes within the organization. As a
result, the project was delayed. However, the City worked diligently with the sub-receipent over the last
                                                                                                        8
year to ensure that the project moves forward. The Rehabilitation work have began and is expected to
be completed by the end of 2018.

Discuss how these outcomes will impact future annual action plans.

As discussed previously, the rehabilitation work at Opportunity Center and the Minor Home Repair
Program has begun. The Opportunity Center rehabilitation work is expected to be completed by the end
of 2018. The FY 2017/18 CAPER includes 88 units from the Opportunity Center rehabilitation project
that were detailed in the 2018 Annual Action Plan. This goal will be meet but it was delayed. There is no
future impact to the City’s annual plans.

The FY 17/18 goals for the Minor Home Repair were also not meet due to factors outside the City’s
control. The program is underway and the City and subreceipient, Habitat for Humanity, are hopeful
that the program will be able to achieve the FY 17/18 and FY 18/19 goals in the near future.

The City anticipates meeting all of its goal highlighted in the 2015-2020 Consolidated Plan despite not
meeting last year’s annual goal.

Include the number of extremely low-income, low-income, and moderate-income persons
served by each activity where information on income by family size is required to determine
the eligibility of the activity.

health and emotional health issues. The SRO Resident Services Coordinator works closely with residents
with severe mental health issues to ensure compliance with treatment guidelines and to reduce the risk
of relapse. PAHC continued to expand the health and wellness program by collaborating with other
non-profit organizations to host a health and resource fair. The goal of the event was to provide
information and resources on topics of the areas of health care, counseling, transportation programs,
social services, and food programs. During the program year, nutrition and fitness coaching services
were initiated to provide residents with information, guidance and support as to how to develop an
exercise and plan programs in order to improve their health and quality of life.
                                                                                                         10

CR-30 - Public Housing 91.220(h); 91.320(j)
Actions taken to address the needs of public housing

The Housing Authority of the County of Santa Clara (HACSC) owns and manages four public housing
units, which are all located in the City of Santa Clara.

Actions taken to encourage public housing residents to become more involved in
management and participate in homeownership

While the majority of their units have been converted to affordable housing stock, HACSC is proactive in
incorporating resident input into the agency’s policy-making process. An equitable and transparent
policy-making process that includes the opinions of residents is achieved through the involvement of
two tenant commissioners, one being a senior citizen, on the HACSC board.

HACSC has been a MTW agency since 2008. In this time the agency has developed 31 MTW activities.
The vast majority of its successful initiatives have been aimed at reducing administrative inefficiencies,
which in turn opens up more resources for programs aimed at LMI families.

As mentioned previously, there are no public housing facilities in the City of Palo Alto.

Actions taken to provide assistance to troubled PHAs

Not applicable.

CR-35 - Other Actions 91.220(j)-(k); 91.320(i)-(j)
Actions taken to remove or ameliorate the negative effects of public policies that serve as
barriers to affordable housing such as land use controls, tax policies affecting land, zoning
ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limitations, and policies affecting the
return on residential investment. 91.220 (j); 91.320 (i)

The City of Palo Alto has undertaken a number of actions to eliminate barriers to the development of
affordable housing including participation in a county-wide effort to provide additional affordable
housing units; programs in the 2014-2023 Housing Element Update to increase the supply of affordable
housing; and the development impact fees for housing.

Housing Trust Silicon Valley (Housing Trust):The Housing Trust, formerly the Housing Trust Fund of
Santa Clara County (HTSCC), was created to provide additional financial resources to address the
County’s affordable housing deficit. The Housing Trust’s mission is to make Silicon Valley a more
affordable place to live. Loans and grants are issued to increase the supply of affordable housing, assist
first-time home buyers, prevent homelessness and stabilize neighborhoods. Palo Alto was among the
contributors during its founding and has continued to allocate funding. A provision was added to ensure
the City’s funds be used exclusively for qualifying affordable housing projects within the City of Palo
Alto. The most recent included $200,000 from the City’s Residential Housing Fund for Fiscal Year
2014/2015.

Participation in the Housing Trust has increased the available housing funding for a number of Palo Alto
Projects as summarized in the table below. In addition, the Housing Trust has invested over $100,000
assisting 16 households to purchase homes in Palo Alto through its first-time homebuyer program.




                                                                                                       14
2015-2023 Housing Element Update: The Palo Alto Housing Element, which is part of the City’s
Comprehensive Plan is the chief policy document describing the City’s housing needs and the policies
and programs the City will use to meet those needs. The 2015-2023 Housing Element Update has been
certified by the California State Department of Housing and Community Development.

Development Impact Fees for Housing: The City’s impact fees are comprised of four categories:
Housing, traffic, community facilities, and Parkland dedication. The City recently completed Nexus
Studies for Residential and Commercial Development. The studies served as a basis for an update to
both residential and non-residential housing fees and became effective on June 19, 2017. The housing
fee for non-residential development is $20.37 per square foot for retail and hotel uses. The fee for
commercial uses increased to $35 per square foot. The fee rate applies to all net new commercial
square footage on a site. Full payment is required at building permit issuance with some exemptions
including hospitals and convalescent facilities, private education facilities, public facilities and private
clubs, lodges and fraternal organizations.

Actions taken to address obstacles to meeting underserved needs. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)

The City’s CDBG program diligently works with other purveyors of funding to provide the most value per
dollar. This is actualized by partnering with other City resources such as HSRAP and leveraging dollars
invested in site acquisition for low-income housing with a multitude of other funding sources. However,
Palo Alto is at a disadvantage in removing or eliminating obstacles to meeting underserved needs due to
the consistently shrinking amount of CDBG funds available in recent years. To address this, the City
supplements its CDBG funding with other resources and funds, such as:

· The City’s Human Service Resource Allocation Process (HSRAP) provides approximately $1,464,146
from the General Fund in support of human services. The HSRAP funds, in conjunction with the CDBG
public service funds, are distributed to local non-profit agencies.

· The Palo Alto Commercial Housing Fund is used primarily to increase the number of new affordable
housing units for Palo Alto’s work force. It is funded with mitigation fees required from developers of

· The Palo Alto Residential Housing Fund is funded with mitigation fees provided under Palo Alto’s BMR
housing program from residential developers and money from other miscellaneous sources, such as
proceeds from the sale or lease of City property.

Actions taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)

Lead poisoning can cause permanent damage to the brain and many other organs, and can result in
reduced intelligence and behavioral problems in young children. More than 80,000 children younger
than 6 years old living in the United States have lead in their blood that is above the level of concern set
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A significant number of these children are in
families of low income and are living in old homes with heavy concentration of lead-based paint and
lead-contaminated dust and soil in the environment.

The City’s housing and CDBG staff provide information and referral to property owners, developers, and
non-profit organizations rehabilitating older housing about lead-based paint hazards. There is no
information that indicates lower income households are more likely to be exposed to lead paint hazards
in Palo Alto than are families in the general population. The City’s 2015-2020 Consolidated Plan has a
more detailed discussion of lead based paint in the City. Any house to be rehabilitated with City
financial assistance is required to be inspected for the existence of lead paint and lead paint
hazards. The City will provide financial assistance for the abatement of such hazards in units
rehabilitated with City funding.

Actions taken to reduce the number of poverty-level families. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)

The City, in its continuing effort to reduce poverty, prioritized funding agencies that provide direct
assistance to the homeless and those in danger of becoming homeless. In FY 2017-2018, these programs
included the following:

The Workforce Development Program provided a transition from unemployment and homelessness to
regular employment and housing through case management, job training, mentoring, housing, and
transportation assistance.

-Downtown Streets Team is a nonprofit in the City that works to reduce homelessness through a “work
first” model. Downtown Streets Team utilized their community connections to provide training and job
opportunities to homeless people, specifically in the downtown area. The Downtown Streets Team has
helped over 789 team members maintain employment for 90 days or more and housed 842 individuals,
including 610 team members since its inception. The Downtown Streets Team has initiatives in Palo Alto,
Sunnyvale, San Jose, and San Rafael.

As mentioned previously, the City provided LIFEMOVES OPPORTUNITY CENTER with $37,328 in CDBG
funds in FY 17/18. The Opportunity Services Center provided services to homeless individuals and those
at-risk of becoming homeless. Services include drop-in services, showers and laundry facilities, lockers,
light snacks, information and referral, transportation assistance, a clothes closet, medical and psychiatric

                                                                                                          16
screening and referral, inter-faith chaplaincy, and fellowship. During the program year, the Opportunity
Center served 614 unduplicated individuals. 431 unduplicated individuals received case management,
housing/job search, referral and mentoring services; and 6,648 shelter nights were provided.

Actions taken to develop institutional structure. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)

The City is striving to improve intergovernmental and private sector cooperation to synergize efforts and
resources and develop new revenues for community service needs and the production of affordable
housing. Collaborative efforts include:

·    Regular quarterly meetings between entitlement jurisdictions at the CDBG Coordinators Meeting
and Regional Housing Working Group

·    Joint jurisdiction Request for Proposals and project review committees

·    Coordination on project management for projects funded by multiple jurisdictions

·    HOME Consortium between member jurisdictions for affordable housing projects

Recent examples include the effort by the County to create a regional affordable housing fund, using
former redevelopment funds that could be returned to the County to use for affordable housing.

Another effort underway involves the possible use of former redevelopment funds to create a
Countywide pool for homeless shelters and transitional housing. These interactions among agencies
generate cohesive discussion and forums for bridging funding and service gaps on a regional scale.

Actions taken to enhance coordination between public and private housing and social service
agencies. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)

The City benefits from a strong jurisdiction and region-wide network of housing and community
development partners, such as the County and the CoC. To improve intergovernmental and private
sector cooperation, the City will continue to participate with other local jurisdictions and developers in
sharing information and resources.

In addition to the actions listed above, the City will continue to coordinate with the City’s human
services funding efforts to comprehensively address community needs.

Identify actions taken to overcome the effects of any impediments identified in the
jurisdictions analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. 91.520(a)

The City makes every effort to affirmatively further fair housing in compliance with the adopted Analysis

                                                                                                         17
of Impediments. During Fiscal Year 2017/2018, the City continued to support actions to affirmatively
further fair housing through a subrecipient agreement with Project Sentinel, a non-profit organization
dedicated to assisting individuals with housing problems discussed in detail below. The following is a list
of actions taken to affirmatively further fair housing:

    •   HCD has certified the City’s 2015-2023 Housing Element update
    •   The City targeted the majority of its CDBG and local housing funds to increasing and preserving
        the supply of affordable housing
    •   The Office of Human Services regularly met with the County of Santa Clara Housing Authority to
        place homeless individuals with section 8 vouchers
    •   Affordable housing information and referral services were provided by the Office of Human
        Services

During Fiscal Year 2017/2018, the City continued to support actions to affirmatively further fair housing
choice through a subrecipient agreement with Project Sentinel, a non-profit organization dedicated to
assisting individuals with housing problems. Project Sentinel responded to and investigated 20 cases of
housing discrimination in Palo Alto during the fiscal year.

CR-40 - Monitoring 91.220 and 91.230
Describe the standards and procedures used to monitor activities carried out in furtherance
of the plan and used to ensure long-term compliance with requirements of the programs
involved, including minority business outreach and the comprehensive planning
requirements

Under the CDBG Program, the City conducts desk reviews and on-site monitoring of subrecipients. Last
year the City completed on-site monitoring of three non-profit organizations. Since the City operates
under a two-year funding cycle there are some subrecipients that receive funding for two years and are
only required to have one on-site monitoring during this time. Typically, subrecipients who have had
trouble implementing projects or have been identified as having compliance issues in a previous
monitoring are selected for the annual monitoring. There were no major deficiencies identified during
the previous monitoring. The City will be conducting on-site monitoring of four subrecipients in the next
two to three months consistent with the Subrecipient Monitoring Plan.

Citizen Participation Plan 91.105(d); 91.115(d)

Describe the efforts to provide citizens with reasonable notice and an opportunity to
comment on performance reports.

A notice regarding the availability of the draft CAPER was emailed to interested organization and
persons. In addition, a notice informing the public of the availability of the CAPER was published in the
Palo Alto Weekly on August 31, 2018.

 The draft CAPER was available for public review and comment for a 24-day period, beginning August 31,
2018 and concluding on September 24, 2018. Copies of the draft report were available at the City’s
Planning Department reception desk, the Development Center, and on the CDBG website. Finally, the
Human Relations Commission held a public hearing on Thursday, September 13, 2018 to take public
comment and discuss the CAPER. The City Council will receive a copy of the final CAPER along with any
public comments received in early November.
