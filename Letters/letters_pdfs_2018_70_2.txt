Dear Mayor and Council Members,

I have spent the last year going to meetings of the Committee to House the Bay Area (CASA) and
SV@Home to hear their discussions about the obstacles to building more housing for low-income and all
residents. I have also closely followed the housing work plan initiated at the request of council. Prior to
that i served on the CAC where we discussed the city Housing Element.

Here is a summary of what i have learned.

1) Housing is expensive to build and costs are continuing to rise for a number of reasons--both for BMR
and market rate units.

2) Projects must pencil out if they are going to get built. This is true for both non-profit and market rate
developments. Perhaps the greatest public misunderstanding on this issue relates to the requirements of
equity and lending partners. Often the public tends to blame developer profits instead for high rents.

Lenders require that rents cover debt service costs with a safety margin. This has nothing to do with
developer or owner profits. It is a condition for getting loan financing, which is critical to most projects.

Equity partners require a a return on their investment that competes with other returns they can get with
alternative investments.

Most if not all projects cannot go forward if they do not meet financing partner requirements.

3) Both of the above factors create the incentive and requirement for units that can command high rents
for market rate projects. Non-profit developers must have costs low enough that their financing partners
qualify for tax credit financing.

4) All parties (CASA, SV@Home and the city housing work plan) have identified cost and other barriers to
building housing that must be addressed if our city or any city can meet its housing goals.

5) The above factors are why our Housing Element, while technically identifying sites that could house
enough units to meet our housing goals to 2023, is not a plan for success AS FEW OF THE IDENTIFIED
SITES ARE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE.

6) The above mean that zoning must change. The council has recognized this with the two recent overlay
zones and the proposals for increased FAR and housing incentives in the housing work plan.

7) Costs such as fees and parking as well as density limits constrain our ability to have developers bring
forth projects (market rate and BMR) that meet the requirement of their financing partners.

                                                         
8) Finally, sites on which a meaningful amount of housing can be built are often rare and, therefore,
precious if we are to meet our housing goals.

I hope you will keep these factors in mind as you do the pre screening Monday night on the San Antonio
housing proposal.

The project provides a meaningful number of new units comparable to projects on the Wilton and VTA and
some El Camino sites.

The project provides a mix of unit sizes

The project meets the BMR requirement

The project meets city standards for parking, which will be underground.

I do understand that in an ideal world the council was hoping to meet the Comp Plan goal with a minimum
of new housing on San Antonio. But we do not live in Palo Alto with an excess of active housing proposals.

From my perspective as a resident this project will make a meaningful contribution to meeting our housing
goals and give a welcoming signal that Palo Alto is open to new housing proposals for the council and
community to review.

CERTAIN ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN LEASE FINANCING DOCUMENTS


Dear City Council:

Please remove agenda item #16 from tonight's City Council agenda, and
please cancel tonight's Public Improvement Corporation meeting, because
the agenda item description for item #16 on the City Council agenda and
the agenda description for the only item on the Public Improvement
Corporation agenda fail to provide an adequate description of the subject
to be discussed in violation of the Ralph M. Brown Act.

I have reviewed the publicly posted agenda after 11:00 am today and
learned that there have been no revised agendas posted within 24 hours of
the two meetings that correct the inadequate agenda item descriptions.

Agenda item #16 refers to the "California Avenue Parking Garage", but
there is no parking garage on California Avenue that is the subject of the
agenda item. Therefore, the public has no way of knowing the parking
garage location by reading the agenda item description. 

The only agenda item on the Public Improvement Corporation agenda refers
to "Certain Lease Financing Documents" and "Certain Actions with Respect
Thereto". Therefore, that agenda item description is similar to the issue
considered by the California Office of the Attorney General in Opinion No.

purchase would not satisfy the disclosure prerequisite for a closed
session regarding the purchase of any one or more of such parcels."

Tonight's Public Improvement Corporation agenda description for agenda
item #1 uses the vague word "certain" that gives even less information
about the subject of the agenda item description than the agenda item
description that the Opinion of the Attorney General found to be
insufficient.

The Opinion's reasoning is independent of whether the meeting is a
closed session or an open session, and is independent of whether the
subject matter is real estate negotiation or is the construction and
financing of a parking garage.


Who Benefits, Who Pays, and Where is the Money?

The purpose of building a parking garage in a commercial business district
is to enrich investors, realtors, landlords, mortgage lenders, title
companies, architects, planning consultants, and builders who benefit from
the increasingly intensive use of land.

Consistent City of Palo Alto policy has been to require those who benefit
from constructing such parking garages to pay for the garages by forming
an assessment district to charge commercial property owners for the cost
of the garage.

Exceptions are often included in the calculation of assessments to enable
those in the assessment district to collectively pay less that the full
cost of the garage.

The determination of the number of parking spaces for the commercial
properties served by the garage often fails to account for the additional
employees that need parking when more employees are crammed into a given
space.

Residents become the victims of the under-estimation of parking spaces by
having their neighborhood streets serve as parking lots for commercial
district employees.

The victims are then required to pay for the parking garage itself by
having City services cut to provide the funds to make up the shortfall in
garage funding caused by the assessment process that is designed to
generate less money than the garage costs.

Now staff wants to make the residents situation worse by not forming an
assessment district that would require commercial property owners to agree
                                     
to fund the garage before you approve the construction and financing
tonight.

Voters are being led to believe that the proposed tax on this November's
ballot will pay for a long list of infrastructure projects, including new
parking garages in two commercial business districts, that would require
more money than the tax measure could possibly raise.

Now, when the election is still three weeks away and nobody knows if the
voters will approve the tax measure, you are being asked by staff to take
actions that are estimated to cost the City over $2.4 million a year for
30 years without staff including in its report (ID # 9689) the source
of $39.5 million in garage costs before you even know how much the garage
will actually cost.

Does staff really believe that your approval of the construction and
financing of the garage before the election will increase the number of
votes in favor of the tax measure on the ballot?


Distractions and Conclusions

Some people believe you should build housing on the site designated for a
parking garage in the University Avenue Commercial District, while the
same people ignore the debate about whether sites that could have more
offices should instead be rezoned for exclusive residential use.

Other people believe you should focus on the design and location of
bicycle lanes instead of addressing the root cause of traffic congestion
and unsafe conditions which is too much development of offices; a lack of
parking in commercial districts for the occupants of those offices; and
the failure to require those who benefit financially from the garages to
pay for them, while residents have to subsidize that development when
their neighborhoods are turned into commercial parking lots and their
services are cut to provide the funds needed for garages that are
for someone else's financial enrichment.

When these agenda items return to you on agendas that include agenda item
descriptions that comply with the Brown Act, I urge you to not be
distracted by side issues, but rather focus on issues of benefit, costs,
and funding sources that are the key issues in the garage construction and
financing debate, and that are directly related to the key issues in this
November's City Council election that include the amount and annual rate
of development, the mix of development between residential and non-
residential uses, the appropriate allocation of revenue raising measures
between residents and businesses, and the equitable division of City
expenses between infrastructure and services.

You should wait until after the November election results are certified in
December before you act on these two agenda items.

Dear Council Members and City Staff,

As we approach the implementation phase of the plans for a new parking garage for the California
Avenue area, I and my my neighbors and I neighbors would like to express our appreciation for your
support for this project in its entirety with no shortcuts. As commercial activity and traffic has increased
in this area, the need for parking has gone up with negative effects on the bordering residential
neighborhoods until the enactment of the recent residential parking permit program.

We would now like to suggest as part of the process of actually constructing the garage that an
agreement be reached that the number of commercial employee permits issued in Evergreen Park and
Mayfield be reduced. This new garage is being funded by the taxpayers, and at least some of its benefits
should flow back to the residents. We urge you to include, as part of the project’s guidelines, a
commitment not later than April 1, 2019, to reducing the negative effects of employee parking in
residential neighborhoods such as traffic congestion, parking “bunching” on selected streets/blocks, and
a lower quality of life.

Unfortunately, my neighbors and I hear rumors are that some[delete some] other City agencies are
thinking of using the new garage as an excuse for permitting additional office space and housing
projects that do not include sufficient parking for their needs. Deliberately increasing the demand for
public parking spaces at the expense of the residential areas is not acceptable. It is contrary to the
explicit statement in the Comp Plan. Businesses and developers should bear the cost of their
construction projects. New projects should not be allowed to impose additional costs on residents, and
should be precluded from purchasing permits in City lots and garages. We already have proof that
requiring businesses to bear the costs of their own operations will not decrease interest in development
in Palo Alto. Our experience with the College Terrace residential parking permit program has
convincingly demonstrated that when businesses and developers know the rules, then can and will
adapt.

Again, I thank you for your commitment to the construction of this garage to relieve the pressure for
parking in the California Avenue area that has been created by many new construction projects and by
changes in the workforce that now occupies many of the older buildings. Please continue to support the
Comprehensive Plan commitment to encouraging commercial activity in the City, but not at the expense
of residential neighborhoods.

Carol Scott
Resident of Evergreen Park

RAIL SYSTEM NOISE AND VIBRATION CONTROL
George Paul Wilson
   Wilson, Ihrig & Associates, Inc., 5776 Broadway, Oakland, California 94618, USA

Abstract
    Control of noise and vibration emitted by steel wheel and rail transportation systems has a long history of designs and
techniques, some of which were dismal failures and some which worked very well. Many of the early efforts had a valid
technical base for the design, however, there were also many based on intuition or ideas with great expectations, but which
had no real technical basis. In the last four decades the technology and materials used for rail noise and vibration control,
particularly for the control of groundborne vibration from rail systems, has developed and benefited from thoughtful
technical analyses and application of simple engineering principles. These also were not always successful in all respects
but provided for a continuing development of the technology with ever-improving success and performance. Included in
this presentation are a review of the development of rail noise and vibration control systems, including the lightweight,
undamped concrete floating slab track for reduction of groundborne noise and vibration, and of the development of
structurally integrated sound barriers with absorption materials for control of airborne sound. The presentation includes
anecdotes and discussion of some of the unexpected results from new design installations, an outline of design progress and
application extensions, and review of the concepts and designs which are successful and currently in use by rail systems
located in many different parts of the world.

marketed in other countries as a quiet system, the
pneumatic rubber tire system was never adopted by Paris
Metro as a feature for new installations, and was used
only for renovation of older subways.
    One of the studies initiated by the BRRT was an
evaluation of pneumatic rubber tire systems compared to
steel wheel and rail to determine whether or not there
was sufficient noise and vibration benefit to justify
adoption of pneumatic rubber tire rather than steel wheel
technology.       The evaluation included the Transit
Expressway vehicles on a test track in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania and the Paris Metro rubber tired lines. The
result of the study was the finding that, when compared
on an equal train speed and equal passenger carrying
capacity, the rubber tire system created the same or
greater noise levels in the vehicle and at the wayside for
surface guideways. The only benefit was reduced

    Much of the early work on development of rail
fixation methods which would reduce the noise and
vibration compared to either standard ballast and tie track
or wood sleepers embedded in concrete, as used for most
systems installed prior to the 1960's, was concentrated on
the development of resilient rail fixation fasteners
(baseplates). As part of its technology development
program, the San Francisco BART system during the
design development period constructed a test track and
obtained three "laboratory" cars for assessment of various
aspects of the transit technology, including noise and
vibration. The test track included ballast and tie and

modern light rail systems do have resilient wheels, not

    The initial assessments indicated several locations
along the WMATA route where mitigation beyond that

necessary. Initially, the planners and consultants for the
system thought that a floating slab track type of
mitigation would be needed at stations, but not in other
locations. An objective analysis showed that there were
many locations requiring added mitigation but only a few
instances where track through stations needed the
mitigation.

     With the selection of elastomer, the design of the
WMATA floating slabs was determined, including the
decision to cast-in-situ continuous slabs with pinned
moment connections between individual sections as the
concrete was poured. While these floating slabs were
successful in reducing the groundborne noise and
vibration, they also radiated airborne noise due to
bending waves in the continuous slabs. For standard
track the low frequency radiated noise was a barely
noticeable addition to the noise generated by the train
propulsion equipment. However, at special trackwork,
the noise was thunderous, audible in the cars and at
station platforms where a crossover was located near the
station. The main problem encountered was that for
some sections the contractors were allowed to substitute          Figure 7          TTC double-tie discontinuous floating

The polyurethane pads turned out to be hydroscopic and
lost their mechanical stiffness when exposed to water.
The failed pads had to be replaced, a process which was
difficult and expensive due to the continuous poured-in-
place slab configuration.
     In 1974 the TTC opened a new Yonge Street
Extension with only the resilient rail fasteners for
mitigation. This line went further into residential areas
than previous lines and resulted in a huge amount of
complaints about groundborne noise and vibration. This
led to extensive research and development programs both
to improve the existing new line and to identify better
mitigation for future new subway lines. One of the TTC
track engineers proposed precast concrete sections as a
lower cost alternative to the continuous floating slab.
The configuration proposed also provided for access and
easy replacement of the isolation pads. With revisions to
optimize the acoustical performance, the design was
developed into what is known as the double-tie or
discontinuous floating slab track.                                Figure 8          Photo of TTC double-tie system in

floating slab was at the Melbourne Underground Loop,
MURLA, subway. The four lines of the Loop are in
close proximity to a number of noise sensitive facilities.
Therefore, an extensive study was completed by
Victorian Railways over the period from 1973 through
1978. This study included a trial installation at the
Jolimont Cutting to provide in-service testing and
evaluation of the proposed floating slab track system.
While the intermediate mitigation of resilient booted tie

was not adequate at others. To avoid the complication of
multiple transitions and multiple types of trackwork to be
maintained, it was determined the entire Loop network
would be the double-tie floating slab. The system was
completed and opened in 1981.

    The new extensions of the Hong Kong MTRC and the
new line constructed for the Kowloon Canton Railway
Corporation, KCRC, have required creative combinations
of structure-borne noise control and sound barrier
technology. The environmental requirements for these
new facilities are among the most restrictive in the world.
At first it was thought that achieving the design goal of
64 dBA at 25 m for a train at 140 km/hr would require a
covered viaduct with floating slab track. However, using
the floating slab track design principles developed and
refined from experience with each new system combined
with a new approach to sound barrier wall design enabled
creating an overall design achieving the low wayside
noise level without a complete cover over the guideway.
    The overall design approach for the 21 km KCRC
viaduct was the use of concrete guideway and girders,
floating slab track to minimize structure-borne noise
radiation from the guideway and integral sound barriers,          Figure 10         Photo of KCRC viaduct completed

    With the technology and materials now available for
rail system noise and vibration control, it is possible to
install new facilities in locations or along alignments
which in the past would have been considered
unfavorable because of the noise and vibration impacts.

REDUCING RAILWAY NOISE POLLUTION


                                   STUDY



    Abstract

    12 million EU inhabitants are affected by railway noise during the day
    and 9 million during the night. This study lists measures, funding and
    regulations to reduce it. The introduction of modern rolling stock will
    lower noise most significantly. In the short run, the replacement of cast
    iron by composite brake blocks on rail freight cars is most important.
    Developing a regulation scheme for a staged process towards low-noise
    rolling stock is the heart of a rail noise abatement strategy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

According to Member State reports compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in
2010, railway noise affects about 12 million EU inhabitants at day time, with a noise
exposure above 55 dB(A), and about 9 million at night time, with a noise exposure above
50 dB(A). In fact, the real figures are undoubtedly higher since the EEA’s European noise
mapping initiative concentrates on agglomerations with over 250,000 inhabitants and on
main railway lines with over 60,000 trains per year. The railway noise problem is
concentrated in central Europe, where the majority of the affected citizens live and the
volume of rail freight transport is highest (primarily Germany, Italy and Switzerland, but
traffic density is high also in Poland, Austria, the Netherlands and France, and noise
mapping indicates that significant population is affected in Belgium and Luxembourg).

Noise is an annoying phenomenon, contaminating the environment and adversely affecting
the health of people exposed to high ambient noise levels above 70 dB(A) – or even less.
The discussion about railway noise has become very important in several European
countries as railway transport increases and plays a more important role in greening
transportation. For implementing the sustainability goals formulated in the EC 2011
Transport White Paper and the Greening of Transport package, the environmental impact
(carbon, energy, noise, etc.) of railway operations needs to be minimised to maintain rail’s
position as a green transport mode – and thereby promote a modal shift to rail, to reduce
the environmental impact of transport overall.

In order to analyse the noise situation in Europe, following current EC legislation, the
Member States have to provide noise maps and noise action plans. Noise action plans
describe the measures taken to lower environmental noise for identified affected
inhabitants. However, legal conditions differ widely across Europe as Member States have
different limits or threshold limits for environmental noise emissions, and usually these
limits are tested only when building new infrastructure or during major redevelopment.

In general, three different sources of railway noise are identified:

   x   Engine noise
   x   Rolling noise
   x   Aerodynamic noise.

Railway noise is largely a problem of freight trains and trains containing older wagons or
engines, and is a particularly severe problem during the night. Rolling noise is generally
higher from poorly maintained rail vehicles, and from trains running on poorly maintained
infrastructure. Aerodynamic noise is particularly relevant for high speed lines where, in
most cases, noise limiting measures like noise barriers are implemented; noise barriers
reduce the impact of rolling noise, but are usually too low to have any effect on noise
originating at the pantograph. Engine noise is most relevant at lower speeds up to about 30
km/h, rolling noise above 30 km/h and aerodynamic noise dominates above 200 km/h. The
most important noise source is rolling noise, which affects all kinds of train.

To reduce railway noise pollution, passive measures at the place of disturbance can be
distinguished from active measures at the noise source. The most important passive
methods used to reduce the impact of railway noise on the environment are noise
protection walls and insulating windows, and for the most part action plans and

investments of the Member States concentrate on these methods. However, they are only
locally effective, requiring huge investments to protect wider parts of railway networks.

In contrast, source-driven measures lower noise across the whole railway system if they
are widely introduced. As an example, the problem of noisy rail freight cars can be reduced
by the replacement of cast iron brake blocks by composite brake blocks. This is currently
being investigated by the railway industry and would affect about 370,000 old freight
wagons. Also, wheel absorbers, aerodynamic design of pantographs and noise insulation of
traction equipment (e.g., locomotive engines) are measures to reduce noise at source.
According to the current Technical Standard for Interoperability (TSI Noise), rolling stock
which was introduced since the year 2000 (including engines and passenger coaches or
passenger power cars) are required to lower noise emissions by about 10 dB(A) compared
to the equipment of the 1960s and 1970s.

In the authors’ opinion, noise should ideally be reduced at the source because these
measures have a network-wide effect. Where track infrastructure causes increased noise
levels (e.g., structure-radiated noise from viaducts or curve squeal in narrow radius
curves), or where the local environment is particularly sensitive to noise (e.g., areas of
natural beauty or urban environments with residences very close to the railway line) then
additional trackside noise mitigation measures may be necessary. Such measures include
friction modifiers, rail dampers, floating (or isolated) slab tracks and of course noise bunds
and barriers in various heights. Vehicles and track should all be maintained to eliminate
unnecessary sources of noise, e.g., corrugation.

Retrofitting of existing rail freight cars with composite K- or (if approved) LL-brake blocks is
the most cost-effective measure on the vehicle side. Additional measures on the vehicle
side are wheel absorbers, vehicle-mounted friction modifiers (most effective in urban or
sub-urban networks) and (for high-speed trains) aerodynamically optimised pantographs
(e.g., shielding or coating). These measures are effective network-wide. Additional research
could be made for modified wheel constructions as they are very effective but experiences
with accidents lead to reluctance to use new wheel constructions replacing mono block
types.

On the infrastructure side, friction modifiers, rail dampers and slab track are cost-effective
measures for reducing noise. In densely populated environments and highly trafficked
railway sections, the use of noise barriers or coverings cannot be avoided. However, if
there is a wide introduction of vehicle-related measures, the number of noise barriers or
covers can shrink significantly.

Additionally, wheels and rails need frequent monitoring and maintenance to reduce noise.
The surface quality of wheels and rails is a key factor determining rolling noise and
deteriorates naturally over time; severely damaged surfaces (out of round wheels or
corrugated tracks) are a major noise source.

The European Parliament and European Commission try to encourage the Member States to
take more action to reduce railway noise, e.g., by introducing noise-dependent track
pricing schemes. Such economic incentives (rail track charging differentiated according to
noise emissions) can help to:

    x   stimulate the use of low-noise technology for the rolling stock;
    x   foster the use of routes which avoid hot spots for noise;
    x   foster noise-reducing operational routines and speeds in sensitive areas.

    ____________________________________________________________________________________________

On the regulative side, the Japanese top-runner scheme1 is an example to come to a long
term reduction of noise. The TSI Noise is an appropriate basis for noise regulation in the
medium and long term. Presently, the standards for noise emissions are valid for new or
modified vehicles only. In the medium and long-term view the TSI can become compulsory
for all vehicles. The noise levels in TSI Noise should also be lowered from time to time
according to technical development similar to the Japanese example.

In principle, there are three approaches to a noise-dependent track pricing, and each can
be configured as a mix of bonus and penalty components:

      1. The train-related noise emissions can be measured at critical points in densely
         populated areas and/or low distances to residential zones and then allocated to the
         trains causing the noise. The noise mark-up for the track charge then would vary
         with the local noise level and eventually with the noise exposure of the residential
         population.

      2. The wagons can be classified into noise categories and charged with a noise mark-
         up or granted with a bonus according to the noise category. The train operator
         would pay the charge to, or get the bonus from, the infrastructure manager, and
         pass the bill or grant the bonus to the car owner or operator.

      3. Trains can be classified on the basis of the rail car types from which they are
         composed. In the case of freight trains, the emission category of a train could vary
         with every change of the train composition in marshalling yards.

The first approach would directly correspond to the polluter-pays principle, but causes high
transaction costs for implementation and control. The second approach is the most simple
and easy to implement, but neglects the nature of rail noise; a high percentage of noise-
reduced cars is required in order to achieve a substantial reduction of train-related
emissions. The third approach does not require a sophisticated payment system but needs
a functioning (eventually international) information system for wagon control.

The charging schemes can be embedded into appropriate legislative regulations to set a
clear framework for long-term activities to reduce railway noise. The following instruments
for regulation are possible:

      x   Limits for stationary and pass-by noise for freight wagons and locomotives;

      x   Operation and maintenance rules;

      x   Noise-limiting technology for new rolling stock according to the Japanese top-runner
          scheme. This scheme aims at reducing energy consumption and climate impact by
          dynamic setting of emission targets on the basis of current best practice (“top
          runners’ performance”);

      x   Retrofitting programmes for vehicles currently in service (phased obligation
          schedule).

Noise depending track access charges (NDTAC) should be introduced to encourage the
vehicle owners to invest in noise reduction measures. At the first stage they should focus
on rail freight wagons but the scheme can include other vehicles or measures later or focus
on noise limits without regard to measure to reach the limit.

Importantly, NDTAC should be realised so that no burdens for competitiveness for the rail
sector appear. Investment and higher operational costs should be covered. NDTAC should
be harmonised in the Member States and each vehicle operating in a national network
should be included (also foreign vehicles). To meet the fact that significant noise reductions
are only to be achieved if trains are completely equipped with low noise equipment, the
NDTAC should favour trains which are nearly fully equiped with these vehicles. To avoid
losses in competitiveness lower TAC for low noise vehicles a substantial part should be
financed by the Member States. To motivate an early switch to low noise vehicles or
retrofitting of existing freight cars also direct funding of investments should be considered
for a few years.

Summary of recommendations

As rail freight wagons commonly travel across wider international distances, it is essential
to harmonise noise legislation policies across Europe. As a result the authors recommend
focusing on the following actions:

    x   Retrofitting the existing freight wagon fleet with low noise braking systems
        especially by replacing the cast iron by composite brake blocks as the most
        important and effective first step of source related noise reduction measures.

    x   Establishing funding schemes to cover the retrofitting and additional operating costs
        of the new noise reduction technologies to avoid a reduction of the rail sector’s
        competitiveness; a substantial part of costs should be covered by the Member
        States, since quieter trains will reduce the need for, and therefore the cost of,
        infrastructure noise mitigation measures.

    x   Introducing rail track charging systems which differentiate the train charges
        according to the noise category of a train. The noise classification of a train should
        be determined by the wagon with the highest noise emission level.

    x   Making activities concerning NDTAC or noise limit regulation depending on the same
        actions in road transport to avoid losses of competitiveness for the rail sector.

    x   Making noise limits by TSI Noise ([TSI Noise 2011] also compulsory for existing
        rolling stock 10 or 12 years after introduction of funding schemes and noise limits
        for new rolling stock.

    x   Adjusting limits of TSI Noise in a phased process for a medium and long-run future
        to foster the development of new noise reduction technologies.

    x   Monitoring and maintenance of noise development due to abrasion to assure low
        noise levels also during operation over long periods.

1.          DEFINITIONS AND EFFECTS OF NOISE

                                       KEY FINDINGS

     x   Noise is sound which is unwelcome but the annoyingness depends on the
         individual.

     x   Noise can be harmful.

     x   The noise pressure level is measured in dB(A) (deci Bel) with a logarithmic scale.

     x   10 dB(A) increase of noise represents a ten-fold increase of noise pressure.

     x   A change of 3 dB(A) is detectable by the human ear, with it representing a
         doubling of noise pressure.

     x   Local resistance against railway noise increases especially in Central Europe
         where most rail freight transport is realised.

     x   The majority of rail transport is realised in France, Germany and Poland.



1.1.        Noise and railway noise

Noise is sound that is unwelcome, because of its volume or structure, and can be harmful.
Since not everyone responds equally to sounds and the perception is dependent on
constitution and mood, noise also contains a subjective component. Therefore, there is no
fixed value at which a sound is perceived as noise.

Rail noise is sound emissions arising from the operation of trains and trams. There are a
wide variety of sources and causes of rail noise, such as locomotives accelerating, freight
wagons braking, squeal noise in curves, vibration from rail corrugation and out-of-round
wheels, vehicle coupling in shunting yards, and even the pantographs of high-speed trains.



1.2.        Measurement of noise

Sound is vibrations in the air around us causing our eardrum to vibrate. The human ear is
sensitive to frequencies in the range 20 Hz – 20 kHz. These vibrations in the air cause
pressure changes, and the change in pressure is called sound pressure. Sound, and
therefore noise, is measured by measuring the sound pressure. How loud we perceive the
sound depends on sound pressure level and duration, but also on frequency and bandwidth.
Psychology also affects our perception and tolerance of sound. Besides sound pressure
level, the duration of the sound, the time of day, the composition and frequency of the
sound must be considered in the assessment of noise. Also, the tonality ("squeak") and
impulsiveness ("hammer") play a role.

The measurement of sound pressure level, usually referred to as volume, has the physical
unit Bel. Normally the term decibel (dB) (i.e., one tenth of a Bel) is used. The additive (A)




                                             15
Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies
____________________________________________________________________________________________

behind the unit dB expresses that the noise measurement is A-weighted (a filter defined by
IEC 61672:2003 norm), i.e., tuned to the perception of the human ear.

While the human ear can perceive an increase in sound volume as sound energy increases,
the relationship is logarithmic. If two identical 10 dB noise sources are placed together, the
perceived increase is not a doubling of the volume but rather a 3 dB increase. If ten such
noise sources were placed together, the increase would be 10 dB – multiplying the sound
energy (and thus the real exposure) by a factor of ten, multiplies the perceived sound
volume by a factor of two.

As such, a sound level increase from 45 dB to 55 dB may not look like much on paper, but
it represents a ten-fold increase in sound energy and its impact on human health. Humans
are usually able to sense a change of 3 dB in sound level, which corresponds to a factor-of-
two change in sound energy, but that is about the limit of sensitivity. Measures to reduce
noise levels by less than 3 dB would, by themselves, be of no real value.

Sound can also be transmitted as vibration through the ground and directly into the body,
and this is also a form of noise pollution.

Three standard measures of average sound pressure level, defined by ISO 1996-2:1987,
are Lday, Levening and Lnight, where day is typically 07.00 – 19.00, evening is 19.00 – 23.00,
and night is 23.00 – 07.00; these are long-term average A-weighted measurements of all
days, evenings and nights, respectively, over the course of a year. Lden is a weighted
average of these three, adding 5 dB(A) to Levening and 10 dB(A) to Lnight; this is defined in
Annex 1 of European Commission Directive 2002/49/EC. The UK uses also LAeq,16h which is
an average of Lday and Levening.



1.3.         Effects of noise

The faintest audible sound is at 0 dB(A); the pain threshold is about 120 dB(A). If it is
louder than 120 dB(A), there is a risk of injury. At a detonated blast of 150 dB(A) the
eardrum can rupture.

Noise exposure during sleep such as night flight noise is regarded as particularly critical. So
night noise causes health hazards already at individual levels below 45 dB(A), if the
difference between the individual level and the background noise is more than 3 dB.

Noise above 55 dB(A) is considered as noise pollution. If noise above this level lasts for an
extended period of time, the efficiency and well-being of a person will be reduced. Noise in
the range 65 to 75 dB(A) causes stress to the body. This can lead to arterial hypertension
(high blood pressure), cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction (heart attack).
Noise can also provide for a reduction of gastric secretion and be the cause of stomach
ulcers [WHO JRC 2011].

In the workplace, above 85 dB(A), a contractor is responsible to ensure his employees have
suitable hearing protection available. If the noise level is over 90 dB(A), employees must
wear hearing protection.

1.4.              Results of noise mapping

According to Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise, all Member
States have to provide noise maps and noise action plans (for details see section 2.2 on
page 29).

The report on the implementation of Directive 2002/49/EC [EC 2011] summarises the
number of affected people by environmental noise in the first round of strategic noise
mapping (see Table 1).

The European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Topic Centre on Land Use and
Spatial Information (ETC LUSI) publishes noise maps on the internet according to Directive
2002/49/EG. The maps are available at [NOISE 2011]. The maps present the population in
each country affected by rail noise (distinguishing agglomerations from main lines outside
agglomerations). Also, affected population by industry, main road traffic and aviation can
be identified. A spreadsheet 2 shows detailed and aggregated figures according to data sent
until 30 June 2010. In Annex I of this study (pages 120 - 121) the results of noise mapping
for the rail sector are shown for all countries inside and outside agglomerations.

According to EEA data, the following states in Europe are mostly affected by railway noise
according to the share of their population that is affected by railway noise with more than
55 dB(A) LDEN: Austria (9.3%), Slovakia (9.0%), Switzerland (7.5%), France (5.5%),
Germany (4.3%), Czech Republic (3.8%), the Netherlands (3.8%) and Latvia (3.0%) (see
Figure 1).

The following Figure 1 shows the share of affected people in each European country
according to the figures delivered by the states to fulfil the requirements of Directive
2002/49/EC.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Analysing the figures in Annex I, it can be seen that about 85% of people affected by
railway noise (over 55 dB(A) LDEN or 50 dB(A) LNIGHT) are located in the following six
countries in Europe: Germany, France, UK, Austria, Poland and Switzerland. About 60% are
located in Germany and France.

If only areas outside agglomerations are considered the figures change significantly. In this
case the six countries mentioned above represent 89% of affected people. The share of
people affected in agglomerations and outside agglomerations differ very much between
the countries. In Germany about 75% of affected people live outside agglomerations
whereas in Poland this share is 0 (Switzerland: 15%, Austria: 59%, the UK: 17%, France:
44%).

Although the number of people affected by rail noise is about eight times smaller than that
affected by road transport noise, the total number remains high. In total 11.8 million
inhabitants are affected by railway noise during the day (LDEN) and 9 million are affected at
night time (LNIGHT). The limit in noise mapping remains much higher than the
recommendations from WHO (see Table 2 page 24).



1.5.       Environmental groups and affected inhabitants

On 7 May 2011, about 1,000 protesters came together in Rüdesheim to protest against the
rail noise in their hometowns along the middle Rhine Valley. They carried banners
demanding a speed limit of 50 km/h in settlement areas and a ban on night trains, word-
playing with the “Deutsche Bahn” as “TaliBahn” and blocking the railway line for 40
minutes. The protests were organised not only by a number of local initiatives, but also by
communities and district administrations.

The main discussion is currently about freight trains as they are identified as the main
source of noise, and they mostly operate at night.

A recent survey [Schreckenberg et al. 2011] showed that 45% of the inhabitants along the
middle Rhine region are highly annoyed by rail noise, compared to only 13% by road noise.
The reason is easy to understand: The topography forces the trains to pass through a
narrow valley between Koblenz and Bingen. Four tracks, two on either side of the Rhine,
cause unbearable noise disturbances in the ears of the inhabitants. Noise maps published
recently show noise levels (LDEN) above 65 and 70 dB(A). These extremes are caused by
400 trains per day, oncoming trains, old infrastructure, and noise reflections on the steep
valley and on the water. Additionally, the EU plans for a European freight corridor from
Rotterdam to Basel will double the number of freight trains of presently 150 per day to 300
per day. Further protests are expected. Further details concerning the Rhine axis will be
elaborated in Section 4.2.1, page 85.

This is not the only protest at the Rhine against rail noise. The plans to increase capacities
on the upper Rhine valley caused massive protests from Offenburg to Basel, where
presently around 10 local action groups are active. In Offenburg, 45,840 objections were
made against the infrastructure plans of Deutsche Bahn, and finally the planning was not
approved by the regional administration. As a result, DB started negotiations about a rail
tunnel under Offenburg and an alignment with the motorway. In other towns, groups
protest against the visual impact of “ugly noise protection barriers” and demand a covered
deep-level track near settlements.

The local action groups are supported by a number of environmental NGOs that operate on
a national or international level. The wide range of demands concerning rail noise may be
summarised as follows:

    x   Freight trains should bypass settlement areas or be guided through deep-level
        tracks, tunnels or fully enclosed tracks.
    x   Equal priorities for noise reduction on existing tracks and new construction projects
        are required.
    x   Regarding the legal framework, the equivalent continuous sound pressure level
        should be complemented by a maximum level measurement combined with
        frequencies (in other words, peak sound levels and noise frequencies should be
        considered, not just averaged sound levels).
    x   Set noise emissions ceilings on railway tracks, in relation to land use and population
        density. Reduction of the permitted night time noise level to 45 dB(A).
    x   Introduce protection against vibrations into relevant laws and regulations.
    x   Set a speed limit of 50 km/h for trains in settlement areas.
    x   Revise the noise standards for new railway rolling stock (TSI Noise).
    x   Establish a binding framework for the use of market-based instruments to ensure
        the polluters pay for their noise costs, including road charges and a framework for
        rail track access charges which will create an incentive for fast and prioritised
        retrofitting of rail wagons with quiet brake blocks.

Analyses of transportation data from EUROSTAT show that in 2009 almost 27% of the total
rail transportation volume in Europe affected Germany. This underlines the importance of
central Europe as a transit region as well as an industrial region and presents the reason
why the discussion, or even the battle, concerning noise is the strongest in Germany.
Poland in the second place has a share of rail freight volume of 12% and France in the third
place has 9%. Concerning passenger transport, Germany has a 20% share and France
21%.

Analyses of the noise mapping results show that the problem is most severe in France,
Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland.

These two aspects are the reason why data, comments, available studies and national
policy activities concentrate mostly on central Europe and, there, especially on the German
speaking countries and the Netherlands. Regarding the main rail transportation axes in
Europe, Germany, Austria and Switzerland are affected by a large volume of transit
transportation. This will even rise according to transportation volume forecasts.

The future development of rail freight transport will potentially extend noise problems to
other countries through which the TEN-T Corridors pass and which will see rising rail
transportation volumes. However, the measures to reduce railway noise which are
proposed in this study can help to prevent problems in corridors where transportation will
rise in future.

2.           LEGAL FRAMEWORK

                                        KEY FINDINGS

     x   WHO recommends environmental noise limits between 32 and 42 dB(A) at
         night to avoid risks for health.

     x   About 1 million years of healthy life are lost every year in the EU due to noise
         reasons.

     x   National noise limits or thresholds differ very much between the Member States
         and exceed the WHO recommendations.

     x   Noise limits are mostly only binding for new build infrastructure.

     x   Directive 2002/49/EC requests the Member States to provide noise maps and
         noise action plans. This has been fulfilled for the first round of noise mapping
         which covers main railways, roads, airports and agglomerations. The second round
         (realised until 30 June 2012) will include smaller railways, roads, airports and
         agglomerations.

     x   12 million inhabitants are affected by railway noise above 55 dB(A) at day time
         and 9 million inhabitants are affected by railway noise above 50 dB(A) at night
         time (major infrastructure and agglomerations).

     x   The Recast of the first railway package will request the Member States to
         introduce noise depending track access charges to compensate investments
         for noise reduction measures for railway operating companies.

     x   The TSI Noise sets noise limits for new rolling stock.

             environmental noise
In this section some recommendations and thresholds for environmental noise will be
introduced.

2.1.1.       WHO recommendations on environmental noise

WHO published in 2011 a study about the burdens of disease from environmental noise
[WHO JRC 2011]. The study used a quantitative risk assessment approach for the
estimation. One result of the study is that, about 1 million years of healthy life are lost in
the EU every year due to noise reasons.

Already in 2009 the WHO working group for preparing guidelines for exposure to noise
during sleep published recommendations for thresholds of environmental noise levels [WHO
2009]. The recommendations are shown in Table 2.

According to the recent UIC study [CE Delft et al. 2011], the social costs of transportation
noise are estimated at about 35 billion Euro across the EU plus Switzerland and Norway in
2008, of which about 90% are related to passenger cars and trucks. The costs of rail noise
amounts to 953 million Euro or 6% of total noise costs and distributes rather evenly to
passenger and freight traffic.

2.1.2.        Limits or recommendations for maximum noise limits in the Member
              States

The European Environment Agency published a comparison of LDEN limits of 14 Member
States 5 in November 2010 [EEA 11/2010].

    Although the effect has been shown to occur or a plausible biological pathway could be constructed, indicators
    or threshold levels could not be determined.

    Note that “environmental insomnia” is the result of diagnosis by a medical professional whilst “self-reported
    sleep disturbance” is essentially the same, but reported in the context of a social survey. Number of questions
    and exact wording may differ.

    The EEA report does not specify which 14 Member States provided the information.

A standardisation might be useful in order to avoid health risks at the same level in every
Member State and to balance competitiveness of all industrial sectors (including transport)
as all Member States have to meet the same conditions.

The figures required as well as recommended by Member States are often much higher
than the recommendations of the WHO. Some national limits or recommendations for
environmental noise are introduced as examples below.

Table 3 shows recommendations for values of threshold for action plans for environmental
noise reduction according to the German Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt)
(2006). These figures are not obligations so that the residents cannot claim any specific
mitigation measures from these recommendations, if they are affected by environmental
noise above these limits. Introduction of measures is a voluntary measure by public bodies.

On the other hand, the levels introduced by German Federal Emission Regulation
(Bundesimmissionsschutzverordnung) are required for new built or modified transportation
infrastructures; environmental noise levels have to fall below the values mentioned in [16.

British standards give acceptable noise levels for properties, and requirements for noise
insulation. However, there are no relevant formal limit values in force in England with
regard to environmental noise from railways. The Noise Insulation Regulations, defined in
British Standard; Sound insulation and noise reduction for buildings [BS 8233:1999], define
a threshold level as part of the eligibility criteria. Furthermore, there are guideline levels to
be found in Planning Policy Guidance that provides guidance on land use with respect to
noise from railways.

Environmental impact is considered as part of the planning permission process for
construction, etc., in the UK. Planning Policy Guidance 24 [PPG 24 2006]: “Planning and
Noise” provides guidance to local authorities in England on how to minimise noise impact
(The Scottish Office issues Planning Advice Note 56 “Planning and Noise” with similar
categorisation of noise levels.). [PPG 24 2006] defines exposure categories for residential
development. These categories define action depending on noise level categories.

Table 7:     Noise exposure categories for dwellings

CATEGORY                                             DESCRIPTION

                Noise need not be considered as a determining factor in granting planning permission,
A               although the noise level at the high end of the category should not be regarded as a
                desirable level.

                Noise should be taken into account when determining planning applications and,
B               where appropriate, conditions imposed to ensure an adequate level of protection
                against noise.

                Planning permission should not normally be granted. Where it is considered that
                permission should be given, for example because there are no alternative quieter sites
C
                available, conditions should be imposed to ensure a commensurate level of protection
                against noise.

D               Planning permission should normally be refused.
                                                                          Source: PPG 24 2006, Annex 1.
Noise levels corresponding to the categories are shown in Table 8.

Sweden has decided long-term goals for noise limits in 1997. Indoor levels should not
exceed 30 dB(A) (LDEN) and 45 dB(A) LNIGHT. Outdoor levels should not exceed 55 dB(A) LDEN
and 70 dB(A) as a maximum on a patio [Blidberg 2011].

According to Royal Decree 1367/2007 in Spain, noise action plans are to be made
according to the following table [Sierra 2011].

Bedrooms in houses located in the 60/60/50 noise contour have to meet 40 dB(A) LDAY, 40
dB(A) LEVENING and 30dB(A) LNIGHT.

Thresholds for noise action planning differ between countries. The differences are even in
classifying noise protection areas. In Germany, action plans which lead to a maximum level
of noise in defined areas are only required for new built and modified infrastructures.

    Aircraft noise: daytime values accord with the contour values adopted by the Department for Transport which
    relate to levels measured 1.2m above open ground. For the same amount of noise energy, contour values can
    be up to 2 dB(A) higher than those of other sources because of ground reflection effects.

Austria requires noise action planning for certain environmental noise levels, depending on
the source of noise. UK recommendations do not require any action, except in the
workplace or for new built and modified infrastructures, and levels depend on use of the
rooms; local authorities have a number of legislative powers to control noise emission.
Mostly the obliged figures are based on the highest level of the German Federal
Environment Agency recommendations.

These examples of legislation rules or national recommendations differ from the WHO
recommendation and are often only relevant for new or modified infrastructure.

The result of this comparison shows that reducing environmental noise is a very important
action for the environment/health of the population. Many people are affected by rail noise
that exceeds the lowest level the WHO Recommendation according to [WHO 2009]
demands.

2.2.          Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC

The Environmental Noise Directive [Dir. 2002/49/EC] has the following aim 7 :

      x   “Monitoring the environmental problem; by requiring competent authorities in
          Member States to draw up "strategic noise maps" for major roads, railways, airports
          and agglomerations, using harmonised noise indicators LDEN (day-evening-night
          equivalent level) and LNIGHT (night equivalent level). These maps will be used to
          assess the number of people annoyed and sleep-disturbed respectively throughout
          Europe”

      x   “Informing and consulting the public about noise exposure, its effects, and the
          measures considered to address noise, in line with the principles of the UNECE
          Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and
          Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, known as the Aarhus Convention, and
          signed on June 25, 1998.

      x   “Addressing local noise issues by requiring competent authorities to draw up action
          plans to reduce noise where necessary and maintain environmental noise quality
          where it is good. The Directive does not set any limit value, nor does it prescribe the
          measures to be used in the action plans, which remain at the discretion of the
          competent authorities.”

      x   “Developing a long-term EU strategy, which includes objectives to reduce the
          number of people affected by noise in the longer term, and provides a framework
          for developing existing Community policy on noise reduction from source. With this
          respect, the Commission has made a declaration concerning the provisions laid
          down in article 1.2 with regard to the preparation of legislation relating to sources of
          noise.”

According to the Directive 2002/49/EG, all Member States have to provide noise maps and
action plans for noise reduction.

Directive 2002/49/EC from 1 June 2011 [EC 2011] shows the current status of
implementation of the Directive in the Member States.

2.2.1.        Status of implementation of Directive 2002/49/EG

The Directive is implemented in all Member States since October 2007 according to [EC
2011]. The 14 8 Member States which did not transpose by 18 July 2004 achieved that by
October 2007. According to the EEA Study “Laying the foundations for greener transport”
[EEA 7/2011] the data provided is 96% complete in mid 2011. In fact [EEA 7/2011]
confirms many aspects concerning limits and the potential risks and limits to avoid risks as
the WHO did in its two studies [WHO 2009] and [WHO JRC 2011]. The road map of the
Directive is represented in [EC 2011] as follows.

Additional to the information shown in Table 10 according to [EC 2011] the Directive
2002/49/EC [Dir. 2002/49/EC] defines one more step.

In the first round of noise mapping and action plans only big agglomerations and intensive
frequented transportation infrastructure is concerned. The second round also concerns
smaller agglomerations and transportation infrastructures.

The range of limits and recommendations for environmental noise differ very much
between the Member States. Only four of them considered health care orientated limits
(EE, LU, PT, SL and the administration of Brussels in BE).

2.2.2.       Noise action plans

Several studies by UIC (see [UIC 2010]) and CER together with UIC (see [CER UIC 2007])
and additional surveys by the authors lead to an overview of the existing noise abatement
actions in the Member States and also in other European countries. All data available are
presented in Table 14.

Reports have been suspended for Greece, Malta and Cyprus due to marginality or non-
existence of rail networks.

Switzerland and Norway are mentioned as non-member countries as they are also
members of UIC as the concerned railway organisation.

UIC (in [UIC 2010]) also mentions an initiative by the group of The Netherlands,
Germany, Switzerland and Italy ([UIC 2010], page 25). In the Rotterdam - Genoa
project, the governments of the states mentioned analysed possibilities to promote
retrofitting of freight cars with low noise equipment (particularly composite brakes). The
study finally recommended harmonised solutions for bonus systems (not only along the
corridors) and to avoid penalty systems.

By the end of 2005, in Europe 1,000 km of noise barriers have been built and
approximately 60,000 buildings have been endowed with noise protection windows. The
measures resulted in noise protection for about 1,250,000 citizens. The measures
comprised annual investments of 150–200 million Euros. The estimated total costs for
infrastructure measures are estimated at up to € 10 billion.

Most national activities and investments so far concentrate on infrastructure: noise
barriers, rail damping and friction modifiers. Many countries and projects also concentrate
or integrate source driven measures like wheel dampers or composite brake blocks.

Interviews conducted with rail industry representatives from DB and ÖBB suggest that
noise bonus regulations shall be unique across Europe to increase the incentives for wagon
owners and operators to retrofit old rolling stock and to minimise market distortions among
rail transportation companies.

2.3.       Recast of the First Railway Package

The First Railway Package consists of Directives 2001/12/EC (amending Council Directive
91/440/EEC on the development of the Community’s railways), 2001/13/EC (amending
Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings) and 2001/14/EC (on
the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of
railway infrastructure and safety certification). This was designed to open the international
freight market by setting out the conditions for licensing freight operators in Europe, to
define the roles of the infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, and to set out a
policy for capacity allocation and infrastructure charging.

The Second Railway Package includes the Railway Safety Directive (Directives 2004/49/EC
and 2008/110/EC) and EC Regulations 881/2004 and 1335/2008 which required the
establishment of national safety authorities and investigatory bodies who report to the
European Railway Agency, responsible for rail safety and interoperability as well as drafting
legislation for a harmonised European rail system. The Second Package also includes the
Interoperability Directive (2008/57/EC) which defines how the Technical Standards for
Interoperability (TSIs) should be developed, e.g., TSI Noise relating to “‘rolling stock –
noise’ of the trans-European conventional rail system”, Commission Decision 2011/229/EU
(see Section 2.4, page 42).

The Third Railway Package focuses on opening up international passenger services to
competition within Europe, and includes Directive 2007/58/EC (amending Council Directive
91/440/EEC on the development of the Community’s railways and Directive 2001/14/EC on

the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of
railway infrastructure).

On September 17th 2010, the European Commission delivered a proposal for a Recast of
the First Railway Package [COM(2010) 475]. Article 7 of Dir. 2001/14/EC covers “Principles
of charging”. Noise is not mentioned explicitly in Dir. 2001/14/EC, but the directive allows
infrastructure charges to be modified based on environmental impact. This enables Member
States to introduce noise-dependent track access charges if this is introduced also for
competitive transportation modes or the total turnaround for infrastructure companies does
not rise. Article 31 of the proposed Recast, based on Article 7 of Dir. 2001/14/EC, explicitly
allows differentiation of track access charges based on the noise emission characteristics of
the rolling stock if the same is introduced for road transport.



2.4.         TSI Noise

The basis for all subsystems (infrastructure, energy, control-command and signalling,
operation and traffic management, telematics applications, rolling stock and maintenance)
of the railway system are the “European Railway Technical Specifications for
Interoperability (TSIs)”. The elaboration of TSIs is introduced in Directive 2008/57/EC. The
European Railway Agency (ERA) is responsible for the coordination of development of the
TSIs. For this, ERA organises working groups for the different subsystems which consist of
experts and authorities. The ERA pays attention that all relevant stakeholders are
represented in the working groups.

All TSIs are directly valid for each Member State for new build or modified subsystems. If
exceptions must be made, the Member States have to declare this precisely. General
exceptions are only possible for underground, tram and regional rail systems;
infrastructures / networks which are separate from the rail network and are only used for
local and urban transport; private rail infrastructure and vehicles which are only used on
the private infrastructure which is only used for freight transport for the owner;
infrastructures and vehicles which are only for local use or historical and touristic uses.

The new European Railway Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI) for Noise (TSI
Noise), document No. 2011/229/EU (published on April, 4th 2011) defines maximum noise
levels for rolling stock [TSI Noise 2011]. This TSI is part of the subsystem rolling stock. It
replaces the version of 2006 [TSI Noise 2006]. Maximum noise levels are defined for
stationary and for pass-by noise on defined rail reference tracks and at defined speed. For
engines, starting noise levels and interior noise within the driver's cab are also defined
where applicable. Interior noise within the driver's cab is not relevant for this study. Details
are presented in Annex II. According to Directive 2008/57/EG these limits are directly valid
for new build vehicles.

Pass-by noise is defined at a distance of 7.5 metres from track centre line and 1.2 metres
above upper surface of the rail. Details about the reference track are to be found in the TSI
Noise. The reference track is defined by its roughness and its dynamic behaviour (described
by the vertical and lateral track decay rates).

In Commission Decision of 30 May 2002 concerning the technical specification for
interoperability relating to the rolling stock subsystem of the trans-European high-speed
rail system referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 96/48/EC (2002/735/EC) noise limits
were set to rolling stock of high speed trains [Com 2002/735/C].

2.5.         Measuring and computing of railway noise

2.5.1.       Legislation according to Environmental Noise Directive

The EU Directive 2002/49/EC demands in its Annex 1 the following formula to calculate the
relevant day-evening-night level (on the basis of measured noise levels):




in which:

   x     Lday is the A-weighted long-term average sound level as defined in [ISO 1996-2:
         1987], determined over all the day periods of a year,
   x     Levening is the A-weighted long-term average sound level as defined in [ISO 1996-2:
         1987], determined over all the evening periods of a year,
   x     Lnight is the A-weighted long-term average sound level as defined in [ISO 1996-2:
         1987], determined over all the night periods of a year,
   x     Lden is the average noise level for a period of 24 hours (day, evening and night)

and in which:

   x     the day is 12 hours, the evening four hours and the night eight hours. The Member
         States may shorten the evening period by one or two hours and lengthen the day
         and/or the night period accordingly, provided that this choice is the same for all the
         sources and that they provide the Commission with information on any systematic
         difference from the default option,
   x     the start of the day (and consequently the start of the evening and the start of the
         night) shall be chosen by the Member State (that choice shall be the same for noise
         from all sources); the default values are 07.00 to 19.00, 19.00 to 23.00 and 23.00
         to 07.00 local time,
   x     a year is a relevant year as regards the emission of sound and an average year as
         regards the meteorological circumstances; and in which: the incident sound is
         considered, which means that no account is taken of the sound that is reflected at
         the façade of the dwelling under consideration (as a general rule, this implies a 3 dB
         correction in case of measurement) (see [EC 2002], Annex I).

Noise indicators can also be computed (necessary for predictions). Directive 2009/49/EG
defines in its Annex II computing methods which have to be used if the Member States
have no own legislative computing method which is adapted to Annex I of the directive. For
railway noise the calculation method of the Netherlands is prescribed (”Reken- en
Meetvoorschrift Railverkeerslawaai ’96, Ministerie Volkshuisvesting, Ruimtelijke Ordening
en Milieubeheer, 20th November 1996“) [ReMR 1996].

The calculation scheme defines nine train categories where noise levels for pass by of one
of these trains are indicated. Together with the total number of trains of one type, the
averages LDEN and LNIGHT level can be calculated. Supplement factors are indicated for
different types of bridges.

Germany for example has its own calculation scheme. They use the “Preliminary calculation
method for the environmental noise at railways” (Vorläufige Berechnungsmethode für den
Umgebungslärm an Schienenwegen) – VBUSch 2006“ [VBUSch 2006] for calculations for
noise mapping.

All calculations schemes are very complex and exceed the scope of this study, but all
schemes classify trains into classes. For each class an emission factor must be calculated
and the addition of all factors is done with a logarithmic function.

There are currently two main discussions about the calculation schemes - the different
results of different schemes and the rail bonus in calculation. Both aspects will be discussed
in the following sections.

2.5.2.        Different results of different computing schemes

The Dutch scheme uses nine train type categories where the indicators mentioned in the
German scheme are already integrated in general calculation factors for the train category.

The calculation in Germany has a common factor for all train types, modified by individual
bonus or penalty factors according to indicators, whereas the Dutch calculation scheme has
already defined global calculation factors for train categories. So calculation results can
differ according to the scheme used; Lercher elaborated an example of these differences in
ALPNAP project [ALPNAP 2007-2]. Figure 5 which comes from the ALPNAP project [ALPNAP
2007-2] shows an example of the result of different calculation methods for people
annoyed by railway noise. The figure compares BASS3 (INTEC)13 , the MITHRA-SIG 14 and
the Standard set by the Environmental Noise Directive.

Clearly there would be value in a European calculation (and measuring) standard to make
noise effects on the population more comparable.

2.5.3.      Rail noise bonus discussion

In former, and in some current, calculation or measuring methods (see German Schall 03,
for example) a general bonus for rail noise is included. These incentives transfer measured
or calculated environmental noise emissions into a balanced value. Railway noise is often
seen as less annoying than other noise sources. Amongst others this is accounted due to
more times without noise emissions at all. The general discount is between 3 and 10 dB in
different countries [ZEUS Möhler 2010].

Recently, several studies analysed whether this discount is suitable and eligible. The study
“Lärmbonus bei der Bahn?” (Noise bonus for rail?) [ZEUS Möhler 2010] by Möhler +
Partner München; ZEUS GmbH, Hagen, analysed several studies for the German Federal
Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt).

The following table shows the suitability of railway noise incentives according to analysed
studies:

About 8 out of 21 studies came to the result that a rail noise bonus is eligible. 11 of the 21
studies came to the result that either the incentives have to be variable (for example
depending on time, area influenced, noise level; even a penalty should be included), or the
rail noise bonus is not eligible. 2 of the studies remain neutral. If only case studies are
considered, only 2 of 9 studies agreed that a general rail noise bonus was acceptable,
whereas 6 studies suggested a variable noise bonus/penalty system was necessary. The
authors of that study also identified mistakes in the studies considered. The rail noise
bonus/penalty must be further elaborated, especially considering the current modal split in
transportation and the effects of noise at night (interruption of quiet phases), or different
noise levels, for instance.

ZEUS GmbH and Möhler+Partner published an article about a census concerning the
annoyance by rail and road noise at different times of day (Daytime-related harassment by
road and rail traffic noise – Method and empirical results / Tageszeitsbezogene Belästigung
durch Straßen- und Schienenverkehrslärm - Methode und empirische Ergebnisse) [ZEUS
Möhler 2005]. The authors questioned people about their feeling of harassment from
railway and road noise. The most important result is that during the evening and night the
noise coming from railways harassed more than at during the day. This would justify a rail
noise penalty at evening and night time.

As a result of the ALPNAP 15 project, Lercher et al. studied the use of sleeping pills by
people affected by rail noise [Lercher et al. 2007]:

     x    Use of sleeping pills is increasing already at low levels of railway noise from 50
          dB(A) upwards.
     x    The environment noise level of 60 dB(A) at night which leads to the necessity of
          action plans is considerably too high.

This leads to the general result that a rail noise bonus is not justifiable both at evening and
night time but only eligible during the day and not in the night.

             MEASURES

                                          KEY FINDINGS

     x   Main source of railway noise is rolling noise coming from rail freight wagons.

     x   Of minor importance is engine noise (at lower speeds) and aerodynamic noise
         (high speed trains).

     x   Locally also squeal noise can be important.

     x   Rolling stock which is introduced from the year 2000 on is about 10 dB(A) less
         noisy then rolling stock from the 1960s and 1970s.

     x   Against each source of noise an enormous number of measures has been
         developed in the last years.

     x   Rolling noise and wheel noise can be reduced by composite brake blocks
         (freight wagons), resilient wheels or wheel dampers.

     x   Rail noise can be reduced by rail dampers, resilient track pads and combinations
         with noise barriers of different heights.

     x   Track side or vehicle side lubrication systems can avoid squeal noise and are
         well introduced in tram way systems.

     x   The most efficient measure to achieve network wide noise reduction is the
         retrofitting of freight cars with composite brake blocks.



This chapter will identify the main sources of railway noise and measures to prevent or to
protect from it.

3.1.         Sources of railway noise

Many studies and publications exist concerning sources of rail noise. The Working Group
Railway Noise of the European Commission published its Position Paper on the European
strategies and priorities for railway noise abatement in 2003 [EC 2003]. The International
Union of Railways (UIC) published its “Environmental Noise Directive Development of Action
Plans for Railways” in April 2008 [UIC 2008].

Both studies (and others, see, e.g., the comprehensive review given by [Thompson and
Gautier 2006]) identify the following sources for railway noise:

     x   Rolling noise
     x   Power equipment noise
     x   Aerodynamic noise.

The severity and relative proportions of these noise sources depend on train speed. At low
speed, power equipment noise is the dominant source, whereas at medium speed the

dominant source is rolling noise. Only at very high speed does the aerodynamic noise
become an important factor. This effect is illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 6:          Sources of railway noise according to train speed




                                                    Source: UIC 2008, page 7.


This figure shows that between 30 and 200 km/h rolling noise is the dominant source. This
is also the speed range which affects most people living near railway tracks. Low speed is
only to be found in shunting yards, near stations or on factory railways. Speeds of more
than 200 km per hour are only to be found on high speed lines.

The range between 30 and 200 km/h applies to most other railway lines. Mostly these are
older lines built in a time where noise protection was not obligatory. Currently these lines
have the right of continuance. There is mostly no obligation to invest in noise protection
measures but according to Directive 2002/49/EC, many states in Europe already introduce
actions to lower environmental railway noise. The speed range between 30 and 200 km/h is
also the speed where freight trains operate (about 100 km/h). Many sources identify freight
trains as the noisiest trains and they mostly operate outside high-speed lines. The following
table shows the importance of noise sources, depending on train type.

The table confirms the importance of rolling noise. [EC 2003] considers that passenger
trains are already quieter as they are equipped with disc brakes. This measure was not
introduced for noise reduction but to enhance performance at speeds above 140 km/h.

The following figure shows the effect of power equipment noise (here a diesel hydraulic
engine, built 1968 to 1979, German type 218), when a train passes. The engine noise has a
large influence at the beginning of the train passage, but after a few seconds the main
influence is the rolling noise.

Figure 7: Development of noise sources while train passing

Concerning shunting yards: there were no reports identified which elaborate this aspect in
detail. However, noise sources from shunting yards include:

   x   Engine noise from shunting engines
       especially many acceleration and braking phases must be considered
   x   Rolling noise from the wagons
       (especially in the train splitting siding zone behind the hump)
   x   Brake noise
           o Incoming trains
           o Braking of shunting engines
           o Braking of wagons by hump retarders (one of the loudest noise sources)
           o Testing of brakes of ready trains
   x   Noise from shunting impacts

Most shunting yards are located outside housing areas and their number has dropped over
the years. Single wagon transport has even been abandoned in some countries. On the
other hand, single wagon transport is still important and may play an important role in
modal shift. There was no literature found concerning noise from shunting yards. Other
shunting areas are mostly industrial railways where industrial noise protection rules must
be met. Here railway noise is treated together with other noise aspects and is part of the
total noise measurement or calculation for industrial plants.

Engine noise is relevant at lower speeds and so mostly near stations. This concerns
especially acceleration noise when engines (especially diesel engines) work at high power
drain (high motor speed, high inverter and converter noise).

Summary:

    x   The most important source of noise is rolling noise, as this is relevant for
        both freight and passenger trains.
    x   Aerodynamic noise, especially from pantographs, is very important for
        high-speed trains.

3.2.         Noise emissions in relation to rolling stock

For existing wagons and engines no changes need to be made according to TSI Noise [TSI
2011]. Only in the case of renewal or upgrading of the wagon or engine is there the need
for a new authorisation (to be defined by the national authority); the noise levels must be
met with the new authorisation.

The following examples show the development of noise emissions concerning engines and
wagons in the past. Since the year 2000, many new vehicles have been introduced all over
Europe in freight and in passenger transport. In its brochure “Ruhe bitte” (silent please)
[SBB 2011], Schweizer Bundesbahn (SBB – Swiss Federal Railway) showed how pass-by
noise differs between old and new rolling stock. The following figure shows the changes
between old stock (designed in the 1970s, or earlier) and new rolling stock (designed at the
end of the 1990s). For each of the vehicle types, the noise emission measured according to
TSI Noise is shown.

Figure 8:        Noise emission development of Swiss rolling stock




                                                                   Source: SBB 2011.


The engine Re 460 (also known as Lok 2000) is still one of the quietest engines and was
the quietest vehicle of all trains until the introduction of the IC2000 passenger double deck
coaches. Detailed photographs of the modern Swiss rolling stock show that the bogies are
well covered by the whole engine body (Annex III).

____________________________________________________________________________________________

The TSI Noise demands a maximum pass-by level of 85 dB(A) for electric engines and of 80
dB(A) for passenger wagons at 80 km/h. The Swiss examples are already below the noise
level of current European legislation. This is even more interesting as the Lok 2000 was
introduced in 1991 and the IC 2000 passenger cars were introduced in 1997.

[Mather 2006] presented an analysis of sources of noise in comparison with the TSI Noise.
This shows the current performance of rail vehicles in comparison with the demands of the
TSI. The results are shown in the following tables.

The result is that most actions are still to realise at rail freight wagons and less on
passenger trains and modern engines.

Bukovnik, in a presentation about development and measures in rail noise abatement,
gives a comparison of old and new rolling stock [Bukovnik 2010]. The following figure
shows the effect of new self-propelled vehicles for suburban railways. The vehicle type
4020, built between 1978 and 1987, is - at all speeds - about 8 – 10 dB(A) noisier than the
type 4024 (Bombardier electric Talent) built since 2006. At 80 km/h, type 4024 meets or
goes below TSI recommendations.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

L1042 and L1044 are old electric engines, designed between 1963 and 1995. L1116
(Taurus) is a new electric engine built since 2000. L2123 is an old diesel engine built
between 1964 and 1977; L2016 (Eurorunner) is a new diesel engine built since 2002. A
reduction of about 8-10 dB(A) has been realised. With 80 dB(A) at a speed of 80 km/h the
new engines are much below the TSI recommendation of 85 B(A).

This shows that the introduction of new rolling stock can lower noise in a big range. Halving
of noise was realised since the 1960s and 1970s. Nevertheless there are also negative
examples of new rolling stock that may even be noisier than the old equipment. Many
sources recognise the modern Class 66 engine as well as the Blue Tiger engine as being as
noisy as engines from the 1960s. Both engines were constructed in the 1990s and built
since 1998. The great breakthrough to lower noise of engines came according to this since
the beginning of the 21st century.

Nevertheless the noise emissions of about 80 dB(A) for new and modernised rolling stock
do not lead to a reduction of noise below the WHO levels. Also the levels of the example
countries cannot be met with the new rolling stock. But the reduction at the source can
lower the additional needs for local noise protection as they can be less extensive or
avoided in regions where people live far away from railway lines. There quieter rolling stock
can lower the noise measured at far distance to an applicable level.

Summary:

   x     Rolling stock introduced since the year 2000 is about 10 dB(A) less noisy in
         comparison with equipment from the 1960s and 1970s.
   x     So the replacement of old equipment with new ones helps to reduce rail
         noise.



3.3.        Measures to avoid railway noise

Sources of railway noise can be divided into the following aspects:
   x Roughness-Induced Rolling Noise
   x Wheel Noise
   x Rail Noise
   x Squeal Noise
   x High Speed Trains
   x Other Sources of Noise

The mitigation methods studied or already realised in demonstrators or practice will be
introduced with the source of noise.

3.3.1.      Roughness-Induced Rolling Noise

A major, unavoidable source of noise is wheel and rail roughness. Rail corrugation (which
causes intense ground vibration and can increase noise level by 20 dB [CER UIC 2007]) and
wheel flats (regular thuds) are extreme versions of this, but poor rail or wheel surface
condition should be avoided. Regular grinding of rails and turning of wheels helps to
minimise noise. Special ‘acoustic’ grinding can reduce noise levels by about 3 dB
[Thompson 2008-1]; grinding strategies to reduce noise levels were studied in the MONA
project [Thompson and Gautier 2006].



                                             53

Both Speno and Schweerbau offer general purpose grinding, which can reduce noise levels
by 10-12 dB, and special acoustic grinding, which can achieve a further 3-4 dB reduction
[Licitra 2006]. UIC’s 2007 report on the state of the art [CER UIC 2007] states that poorly
maintained track increases noise levels, so that track renewal can achieve about 10 dB
noise reduction, and acoustic grinding can achieve a further 1-3 dB.

Cast iron tread brakes, which are very common in European freight vehicles, tend to induce
a corrugation in the wheels which increases noise levels significantly [Thompson and
Gautier 2006]. By contrast, disc brakes, which are prevalent in passenger vehicles, are
typically about 8 dB quieter [Hemsworth 2006]. The difference between tread brakes and
disc brakes is shown in Figure 11. With tread brakes, the brake blocks press against the
wheel directly on the running surface (the tread), i.e., the wheel surface which is in contact
with the rail; whereas with disc brakes an extra disc is placed on the axle and brake blocks
press against this to brake the vehicle. Because tread brakes, particularly with cast iron
blocks, damage the wheel, the running surface becomes rough and can develop out-of-
roundness, increasing the rolling noise.

Figure 11:       Comparison of tread and disc brakes




                                                                          Source: Hemsworth 2006.


Disc brakes are very expensive and can only be introduced with new freight wagons or
expensive retrofitting of existing wagons (the whole bogie needs to be changed). The EU
Project EuroSabot (1996-1999) looked into possibilities for retrofitting vehicles with a low-
noise replacement for cast iron brake blocks [EUROSABOT 2011], [Hemsworth 2006],
[Thompson and Gautier 2006]. This started the quest for composite brake blocks with
friction characteristics similar to cast iron brake blocks, and suitable for retrofit; these are
called ‘LL-blocks’. ‘K-blocks’ are composite brake blocks used in new vehicle designs.

The advantage of LL-blocks is that the braking system of the wagon does not need to be
modified, whereas for K-blocks there is additional effort necessary besides changing the
blocks. This is because LL-blocks have similar friction characteristics to conventional cast-
iron blocks, whereas K-blocks have a higher coefficient (2.5 times higher).

Both types (K- and LL-blocks) reduce noise levels by 8-10 dB; life cycle costs for K-blocks
are similar to life cycle costs for cast iron brake blocks; life cycle costs for LL-blocks are still
to be determined [CER UIC 2007] concerning operation costs. Concerning K-blocks, some
manufacturers or wagon owners recently detected higher costs due to higher wheel wear
[Gilliam 2008] and [Saabel 2011].

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

The EU Project Euro Rolling Silently (2002-2005) developed three prototype LL-blocks. By
2009, two LL-block types (IB 116* and Jurid 777) were reportedly safe for use in Europe
[Dörsch 2009]. ICER Brakes S.A. sell organic LL-blocks which reduce noise by 8 dB
compared to cast iron brake blocks [Licitra 2006]; organic LL-blocks are also produced by
the Federal-Mogul Corporation.

However, although the new composite LL-blocks are effective at reducing noise, there are
still problems to be solved before they can be implemented across Europe. In tests with LL-
blocks, the wheels’ equivalent conicity increases over time, affecting the dynamic stability
of the vehicles. To address this, a consortium of brake manufacturers and vehicle operators
has established the EuropeTrain project ([EuropeTrain]) which is using a real train
travelling around Europe to speed up testing of LL-blocks.

If the LL-block could be introduced and certified the migration would be relatively easy,
simply replacing the existing cast iron blocks by LL-blocks. Concerning the accreditation of
LL blocks, Mr Lochman from CER expects certification by the end of the year 2011 and the
beginning of introduction mid-2012, whereas Mr Pennekamp, Mr Fleckstein, Mr Mather and
Mr Theis from DB expect certification sometime during 2012. 16 As a result, the authors of
this study expect certification by the end of 2012, which is more practical.

In addition to EuropeTrain, the following two composite brake projects are being conducted
in Europe: Leiser Rhein includes the retrofitting of vehicles, especially in the Rhine Valley,
and LäGiV develops improved K-and LL-blocks.

Summary:

     x    Roughness of rails and wheels, especially corrugation in rails and out-of-
          round wheels, is a major cause of rail noise and needs to be monitored and
          controlled. Infrastructure managers and train operators already have
          maintenance programmes to control rail and wheel quality, and
          infrastructure managers use axle load checkpoints to monitor passing
          traffic and detect severely damaged wheels. Tolerances may need to be
          tightened to improve quality and reduce noise, requiring additional
          maintenance.

     x    The use of composite brake blocks rather than cast iron brake blocks will
          significantly improve the wheel running contact surface and reduce noise
          levels. Retrofitting existing wagons with composite brake blocks is
          possible, and the use of LL-blocks in particular (requiring the least effort
          and cost to retrofit) is currently being investigated by UIC’s EuropeTrain
          consortium. There are still questions about the long-term degradation and
          the life cycle costs of the new LL-blocks that are holding up widespread
          implementation.

3.3.2.         Wheel Noise

The EU Project Silent Freight (1996-1999) looked at possibilities of reducing noise emission
from wheels [Dörsch 2009], [Hemsworth 2006], [Thompson and Gautier 2006]:

     x    ring dampers reduce noise by 6 dB;

     These statements are the results of interviews held by the project team in July 2011.

    x   perforation of the wheel is ineffective;

    x   wheel web shields reduce noise by up to 9 dB.

The following figures illustrate the systems.

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

Further noise reduction can be achieved through the use of a bogie shroud [Hemsworth
2006].

Fundamental redesign of the wheel to reduce noise is difficult due to the need to fit with
existing tread braking systems and the need to dissipate the heat generated during
braking. Reducing the wheel diameter makes the wheel more susceptible to wheel-rail
roughness interaction and can increase noise levels. The RONA project (wheel optimisation
for high-speed lines) developed a new wheel design, JR13, which reduced noise levels by
about 3 dB. The RONA project also developed a wheel, Alu4, with a thick aluminium web
and wheel dampers, with a predicted noise reduction of 12 dB. However, following the
Eschede derailment in 1998 17 , caused by a broken tyre, the industry has been wary of
multi-material wheels. Other incidences with broken axles on freight wagons or ICE trains18
will make innovations of wheels and axles more difficult. The EU Project HIPERWHEEL
(2000-2004) tested a constrained layer damping treatment on the ETR500 high speed train
in Italy and measured a noise reduction of 4-5 dB between 200 and 300 km/h (see
[Thompson and Gautier 2006]).

Lucchini 19 offers a range of special low-noise damped wheels. Syope is a constrained layer
damping treatment; Galene uses tuned absorbers to reduce squeal noise for trams; Hypno
is a friction damping steel design for tread-braked freight wagon wheels. Valdunes20 also
integrates damping systems into wheels, for example, using damping rings to reduce
squeal noise by 10-15 dB (see [Licitra 2006]).

Heathcote Industrial Plastics offers constrained layer dampers which eliminate squeal noise
and reduce under-vehicle noise by up to 30 dB. GHH offers wheel absorbers (5-15 dB noise
reduction) and damping rings. VSG Vibration Absorbers offers wheel vibration absorbers
(10-30 dB noise level reduction at squeal noise peak frequencies). Schrey & Veit offers
wheel absorbers which almost completely eliminate squeal noise, and reduce the noise level
by 8 dB if squeal does occur (see UIC Curve Squeal Project WP3 [Müller et al. 2003]).

Summary:

     x    Resilient wheels can reduce noise and improve ride quality, and can be very
          effective at reducing squeal noise in tight curves. A variety of technologies
          are available and in use in high-speed and metro applications.
     x    Following the Eschede disaster in 1998, there is still a reluctance to use
          non-monoblock wheels in high-speed rail vehicles.


3.3.3.         Rail Noise

Rail dampers – steel masses embedded in an elastomer, fixed to the rail web – were
developed in the 1990s by ERRI in the OFWHAT (Optimized Freight Wheels and Track)

17
     At Eschede the broken separate tyre caused the high-speed ICE train to derail at a switch. The rear bogie of
     one carriage followed the turnout on to a parallel track, and the carriage subsequently hit bridge supports. The
     bridge collapsed onto the train and the following cars crashed into the broken bridge and cars. 101 people died
     and a further 88 sustained injuries. The separate tyre technique was only used with ICE trains to solve a
     primary damping problem with this train type whereas other high speed trains only use full monoblock wheels.

rail dampers further; the new design reduced noise by 6 dB [EUROSABOT 2011],
[Hemsworth 2006], [Thompson and Gautier 2006]. The Dutch IPG project 21 tested rail
dampers and found the silent track dampers and also the Schrey and Veit (S&V) VICON-
ASMA 5RQ absorber to be effective, reducing noise levels by 3 dB [Thompson 2008-2].
Further testing of rail dampers is presented by van den Dool [van den Dool 2007].

Tata Steel offers the ‘SilentTrack’ tuned rail damper system (see Figure 15), with a noise
reduction of 3-7 dB. The rubber at both sides of the metal rail causes the noise reduction.
Over 200 km of SilentTrack are in operational use around the world, including the
Netherlands, Germany and the UK.

Trackside barriers can also be used to reduce noise levels [Hemsworth 2006], [Thompson
and Gautier 2006], but rail dampers can make barriers and screens unnecessary [van den
Dool 2007].

The VONA project also developed optimised rail pads which reduced noise levels by 3-4 dB
[Thompson and Gautier 2006]. Rail pads were also developed in the Silent Track project,
reducing noise levels by 2 dB.

Saargummi and CDM offer a range of resilient rail pads designed to damp noise and
vibration; CDM and Getzner Werkstoffe offer under-sleeper pads and ballast mats and a
range of solutions for slab track and embedded track systems [Licitra 2006].

Pandrol’s VANGUARD uses resilient padding to attenuate noise, but also supports the rail at
the web to prevent rail roll. This system is used in the London Underground (Victoria Line)
and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, for example, and recently in the new development of
Belgrade Central where vibration reduction was a key consideration. When tested in Hong
Kong’s MTRCL test track on plain slab track, the VANGUARD system reduced average noise
levels by 7.3dB in the 20Hz-500Hz range; and by 13dB in the 40Hz-80Hz range. These
tests showed even greater noise reduction was possible by using the VANGUARD on an
Isolated Slab Track (IST); IST has a rubber ballast mat and is easier to install than floating
slab track, but is not as effective.

The Silent Track project developed a new rail section with a narrower fit, along with a new
fastening system and a new twin-block sleeper design; this reduced noise levels by 3 dB.
The Dutch project Quiet Rail Traffic (STV) developed a new, smaller rail section, SA42, for
slab track (see Figure 17); the rail is continuously supported by a stiff embedding material,
and this acts as a damping mechanism. The noise reduction compared to slab track with
UIC 54 rails is 5 dB. Barriers at the side of the track, with a height of 0.7 m, further
reduced noise levels by 6 dB (see [Thompson and Gautier 2006]).

The Edilon Corkelast embedded rail system, which provides a noise reduction of 5 dB, has
been implemented in the rail steel bridge over the Arno in Pisa [Licitra 2006].

Balfour Beatty Embedded Rail System (BBERS) has been shown in a test in Medina, Spain,
to reduce noise level by 2 dB or more, compared to ballasted track [InnoTrack D2.3.3].

Summary:

   x   Noise and ground-borne vibration are a major concern in urban areas, and
       bridges and underground railways require special measures. Resilient rail
       pads are a common solution, but for locations where a greater level of
       damping is required then floating or isolated slab track is a possibility, or
       under-sleeper pads and ballast mats for ballasted track; an alternative to

          rail pads is a more advanced resilient rail support system such as
          VANGUARD.
     x    Resilient rail support solutions interact with each other and also with
          resilient wheel technologies, and the whole system needs to be considered
          and modelled in order to minimise noise and vibration in the required
          frequency range.

     x    Noise barriers have a large on-going maintenance cost, have a high visual
          impact and create problems for track access. Rail dampers can be tuned to
          the local needs of the railway and left in place for the life of the track; these
          can be an effective alternative to noise barriers.


3.3.4.        Squeal Noise and Friction Modifiers

Squeal noise is the high pitch noise (2-4 kHz) sometimes emitted when vehicles are
curving. This is caused by lateral stick-slip behaviour of the contact between the wheel and
rail exciting high-frequency resonances in the rail and wheel. Many wheel and rail damper
solutions target squeal noise.

Friction modifiers are used to change the interaction of wheel and rail to prevent squeal
noise and corrugation. As of 2005, UIC’s position on friction modifiers was that there is no
optimal solution. Friction modifiers can be lubricants, e.g., greases, designed to reduce
friction to 0.2 or less, and usually applied to the gauge face of the high rail in curves where
the wheel flange often makes contact, creating a grinding sound and high levels of wear.
Lubrication is primarily used to reduce wear, and is not desirable on the top of the railhead
where high levels of friction are required for traction (train acceleration and braking). Top-
of-rail (TOR) friction modifiers (FM) control friction to be in the range 0.3-0.35. To prevent
squeal noise, friction modifiers need to have ‘positive friction’ characteristics, so that
friction increases when the wheel slips. TOR FM can also be effective at reducing short-pitch
corrugation (a major noise source) on the low rail in curves, and has been used
successfully in the Heathrow Express to combat corrugation 22 .

Alternatively, special asymmetric rail sections can be used to prevent squeal (‘Anti-Squeal
Profile’), and the track layout can be adjusted to avoid dynamic conditions of the vehicle
which cause squeal noise. Special surface layers or coatings can be designed with special
friction characteristics, such as Duroc AB’s particle-impregnated rail surface. Based on
laboratory tests, this layer has a low coefficient of friction when dry, and is also effective at
reducing rail wear, and even the corresponding wheel wear is relatively smooth (see
[Hiensch et al. 2007]).

The EU Project Q-City (2005-2009) tested vehicle and track lubricators for squeal noise
suppression. On-board lubrication was tested in the Antwerp network and found to be
effective at reducing squeal noise, and for a relatively low cost. A wayside lubrication
system was tested at the STIB depot; the wayside lubrication was very effective,
decreasing squeal noise by at least 16 dB. In general, electric power is required on site for
wayside lubricators, and access to hydraulics for maintenance may be difficult in urban

railways (light rail, underground systems).

The particular through-hole lubricator prototype developed by Lion Oil was found to be
unreliable (see Figure 18). The figure shows the injection device to lubricate the rail-wheel-
contact area. Other similar systems are on the market, and the annexes of [Q-City 2009]
give quotations for: (A) Clicomatic rail through-hole grease lubrication system; (B) FluiLub
rail lubrication systems (vehicle-mounted and track-based).

ELPA d.o.o. offer another through-hole wayside application for suppressing squeal noise,
both in curves and during braking (particularly useful at marshalling yards) [ELPA], [Licitra
2006]. The ELPA system uses an environmentally friendly composite friction modifier.

Other track-based rail lubrication / friction management systems are: Portec trackside
Friction Management System (5-15 dB noise reduction); Schreck-Mieves Electronic Rail
lubrication; and KLS Lubriquip. Other on-board friction management systems: REBS (rail
lubrication, 20-28 dB reduction at 2500 Hz, and wheel-flange lubrication); TracGlide (rail
lubrication); Vogel AG (wheel-flange lubrication); Kelsan/Lubriquip (wheel-side, 2-7 dB
reduction); Barnt Green Birmingham (water spray); SBB (water spray) (see UIC Curve
Squeal Project WP 3 [Müller et al. 2003]).

Summary:

   x   Gauge-face lubrication is the traditional means for controlling wear of the
       high rail in narrow-radius curves, which has a secondary effect of reducing
       noise levels, including squeal noise in some cases. The main technological
       developments in this area focus on the applicators.

   x   Top-of-rail friction modifiers are a relatively new extension of this
       technology, and are used to prevent corrugation of low rails and squeal
       noise in curves, as well as brake squeal in shunting yards.

3.3.5.       High-Speed Trains

Aerodynamic noise becomes significant at high speed (over 200 km/h) reaching a noise
level similar to rolling noise. For electric trains, pantograph noise is also significant at high
speed. Pantographs and the leading bogie are the two main sources of aerodynamic noise.
Pantographs can be shielded (see Figure 19) and/or carefully shaped, and thereby achieve
noise reductions of 5-10 dB in each case (see [Talotte 2000], [Talotte et al. 2003]). [Sueki
et al. 2009] have shown that porous covers can reduce aerodynamic noise of pantographs.

Figure 19:       Shield of pantograph of Japanese Shinkansen Series 700




                                                         Source: Talotte 2000.

Vibrations caused by vehicle-track interaction travel through the ground at a speed that
depends on the ground type; propagation is slower in softer soil. If train speed exceeds the
ground vibration propagation speed, then this creates a ground-borne vibration ‘boom’,
analogous to a sonic boom when aircraft break through the sound barrier. In practice this
means there is a threshold train speed above which ground vibration increases sharply. For
peat and clay soils, this critical speed can be as low as 150 km/h, but bogie spacing and
axle spacing also influence the critical speed [Madshus and Kaynia 2000].

Concerning high speed trains on high speed lines, often ballast-less tracks are used. As this
superstructure is a hard soil the noise can increase due to the hard concrete plate, low
absorption of noise and strong transference. The normal solution is to cover the ballast-less
tracks with dampers.

Summary:

    x    Pantographs are generally higher than noise barriers, and for high-speed
         trains these are a major source of noise. Rather than making noise barriers

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

          even higher or all-enclosing, an alternative approach is to focus on
          aerodynamic design and new materials.


3.3.6.         Other Sources of Noise

Other sources of noise include locomotive exhaust, traction motors, cooling fans, bridges
and train horns [Talotte et al. 2003]. Resilient baseplates are effective at reducing bridge
noise (the Pandrol VIPA system reduced noise by 6 dB in one study [Wang et al. 2000]).
Schrey & Veit (S&V) also offer a tuned absorber system for railway steel bridges [Licitra
2006] with also approximately 6 dB noise level reduction.

It should be noted, finally, that poor or infrequent maintenance can cause increased noise
levels, particularly from components with moving parts, e.g., bearings, vehicle suspension.

3.3.7.         Other options to reduce noise

Other options, such as speed limits and land-use planning, are rejected in [UIC 2008].
Speed limits need to be substantial (50 km/h) to have a considerable noise impact and thus
“are not compatible with the operation of a commercially competitive railway” (although the
benefits of speed reduction should be considered on a case-by-case basis). Land-use
planning measures are of little effect, since further than 50 metres from the source “noise
level is insensitive to even medium changes in distance”.

The redirection of trains is not always suitable. In some cases there may be alternative
lines, but here also people can be affected. So this solution may only be a shift of the
problem. In some cases, for example the Rhine axis, there are no (realistic) alternatives.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Deutsche Bahn has published two graphs in its Statement for Noise Reduction [DB 2010]
Figure 21 shows, on the left, the current noise levels on German railway lines; and, on the
right, the results of a simulation with the assumption that composite brake blocks for rail
freight wagons have been introduced. The graphs show that the network affected by high
noise emissions will shrink by introducing modified tread brake blocks. Fewer lines will be
affected by noise levels between 70 – 75 dB(A) and 65 – 70 dB(A). Nevertheless, there are
many lines which will remain affected by these noise levels.

However, the introduction of low noise wagons with the help of composite blocks lowers the
number and length of rail sections where local (expensive) measures must be taken.

              composite iron soles for rail freight wagons

The UIC published in its report “Railway Noise in Europe – A 2010 report on the state of the
art” a diagram where the costs and benefits of different measures and combinations are
presented [UIC 2010]. Figure 22 represents the main result of the STAIRRs Project (funded
by the EU 5th Framework Programme). The graph shows that the most cost effective
measure to lower railway noise is the retrofitting of freight wagons with composite blocks.
It costs about 5–10 billion Euro and lowers noise for about 100 million people. The
combination of composite blocks with rail-tuned absorbers will raise costs up to 20–40
million and affect 100–150 million people. In comparison, noise barriers (without any
changes in vehicle technology) will cost about 80 billion Euro and affect about 180 million
people. As a result, the introduction of composite brakes saves a considerable amount of
money in comparison with noise abatement only realised by noise barriers.

Concerning the equipping of freight wagons with composite blocks: The noise reduction
effect of a complete train depends in a logarithmic form on the number of wagons equipped
with composite blocks. This effect is illustrated by [Bukovnik 2010].

The red line in Figure 23 is the relevant one. It shows the effect of the total noise emission
(y-axis) of a train in which a certain share of wagons is equipped with low noise brakes (x-
axis). The assumption for Figure 23 is that wagons equipped with composite brakes cause
noise emissions of 78 dB(A), whereas the others cause emissions of 92 dB(A). The figure
shows that noise reduction for a whole train follows the share of noise-reduced wagons and
is disproportionately low until about 75% of the wagons have composite brakes, and after
that the total noise decreases faster.

If 50% of the wagons were equipped with composite blocks the total noise would only be
reduced to a noise level of 89 dB(A) (21% of total possible lowering). Only if about 98% of
wagons were equipped would a total level of 80 dB(A) (86% of possible lowering) be
reached. This means that the lead time until significant noise reduction is achieved will be
very long if the modified wagons are introduced by normal replacing of old wagons by new
ones after the normal operation time of a wagon (about 40 years).

To achieve a significant and noticeable effect, a large share of wagons has to be equipped
with K- or LL-blocks as soon as possible. LL-blocks can be completely introduced according
to the normal operational lives of blocks (which in some cases is less than one year as
normally – operation time for cast iron blocks is about 60,000 km, whereas wagons for
combined transport run about 100,000 km per year). K-blocks can be introduced in about
6–8 years providing the possibility for wagon owners to modify the braking system with the
general inspection.

Conclusion:

Regarding the costs and the associated effects, and current experience of noise measures,
the authors conclude that:

    x   Noise should ideally be reduced at the source because these measures have a
        network-wide effect.
    x   A relatively cheap way to reduce noise on freight routes is to retrofit
        braking systems of rail freight wagons with composite brake blocks as
        quickly as possible.
            o Freight trains are currently identified as the noisiest trains.
            o Most freight trains operate at night which is the most sensitive time of day.
            o Most passenger trains already have disc brakes due to higher speeds and
                enhanced comfort for passengers, so these trains are quieter than freight
                trains.
            o Wheel dampers are very expensive and cause additional efforts for
                maintenance but can significantly reduce noise emission.
    x   In case of high-speed trains, advanced pantograph designs should be considered,
        especially for routes through noise-sensitive areas where noise bunds and barriers
        shield against rolling noise but may not shield pantograph noise.
    x   Where track infrastructure causes increased noise levels (e.g., structure-radiated
        noise from viaducts or curve squeal in narrow radius curves), or where the local
        environment is particularly sensitive to noise (e.g., urban environments with
        residences very close to the railway line (especially agglomerations) or areas of
        natural beauty) then additional trackside noise mitigation measures may be
        necessary.
            o Rail-tuned absorbers can be effective against curve squeal and rolling noise,
                reducing noise levels typically by 3-7 dB(A). These can be a low-cost solution
                which avoids visually intrusive noise barriers.
            o Noise bunds and barriers can be effective against noise propagation, but can
                create problems for track access and have high on-going maintenance costs.
            o Curve squeal and corrugation of the low rail can be prevented using top-of-
                rail friction modifiers.
    x   In the long term, new wheel concepts can be introduced, but these need more
        research and testing before they can be introduced especially into high speed
        vehicles.
    x   In dense populated areas with high frequencies of trains, noise protection walls or
        insulating windows still need to be introduced. Their number could shrink in case of
        well introduced source related measures or modified tracks.



3.5.         Number of rail freight wagons to be retrofitted

To identify the value of retrofitting freight cars with composite brake blocks, an analysis of
the age structure of the fleet must be done. One question is the number of wagons it is
worth retrofitting. Another is the number of wagons that will be replaced by new ones in
the near future, since these are not worth retrofitting.

Unfortunately the only study available concerning the freight wagon fleet is from the year
2004 [AEA et al. 2004]. The figures from that report will be updated by some recent
reports or news from European railways, wagon owners and wagon manufacturers.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

The AEA study mentions on page 38, that Trenitalia has made a detailed survey of the
European fleet in the year 2000. If a retrofitting programme had begun in 2005, the
retrofitting would have affected 650,000 wagons out of 1.2 million.

In general, the AEA study points out that determining the size of the fleet is very difficult
due to the lack of data from some countries. Also, the authors did not get data from each
of the railway companies or countries because the number and age of freight cars is often
confidential for competition reasons. The estimated total number of freight cars in Europe is
given in Figure 24. The age structure of the total fleet of the year 2000 is presented in
Table 20.

To update the figures given in the AEA-study, the authors have made additional analyses

Recent documents from VDV, UIC and others indicate that in Europe 600,000 rail cars still
exist or are relevant for noise reduction programmes. The UIC indicates a total number of
600,000 old wagons to be retrofitted [UIC 2009]. Also VDV together with VPI, DB Schenker

and DB Netz indicate 600,000 wagons where retrofitting must be checked [VDV et al.
2010].

For retrofitting activities the railway alliances UIC, CER, UIRR, ERFA, EIM and UIP together
answered a Consultation document of the Commissions Services [UIC et al. 2007]. Their
statements concerning the worth of retrofitting focus on the number of years a retrofitted
wagon will be used. This is about 4–6 years (one revision cycle) but realistically 10 years.
The normal durability of a freight wagon is about 40 years, so the oldest wagons to be
retrofitted may be about 30 years old. According to the figures mentioned in Table 20, only
264,000 of the fleet of the year 2000 are valid for retrofitting (only the categories up from
the year 1980). General figures about the total number of wagons currently operating in
Europe are 600,000 or 650,000. The difference between the wagons up to 30 years and the
highest number of wagons in operation makes 386,000 wagons which either have been
built since the year 2000 or before 1980. Estimating that the normal life time of freight
wagons is 40 years, almost 80% of wagons produced between 1970 and 1980 are still in
use. That makes about 300,000 wagons. So about 86,000 wagons must have been
produced since the year 2000. Together with the fleet worth retrofitting, from between the
years 1980 and 2000, this makes a total of 350,000 wagons.

An interview with Mr Kerth from VDV by the authors came to an estimate of 350,000 to
370,000 wagons to be retrofitted. Also KCW indicates a total number of 370,000 freight
cars to be retrofitted [KCW 2009].

Summary:

    x   Although the exact number is not known, a reasonable estimate is that
        there are currently 370,000 freight wagons suitable for retrofitting with
        composite brake blocks.

4.1.1.       Rhine Axis

The Rhine Axis beginning at the ARA ports and ending in Basel with the continuance via
Gotthard and Lötschberg to north Italy represents one of the most important freight
corridors.

The main areas where the discussions about railway noise are currently the strongest are
the section between Bingen and Koblenz and the new build “Rheintalbahn” between
Karlsruhe and Basel. The section Bingen – Koblenz is the narrowest section of the Rhine
Axis where railway lines are located on both sides of the Rhine. The rail track follows the
river with many sharp turns. The section Bingen – Koblenz will be described in Section
4.2.1 on page 84. This section focuses on the Rheintalbahn.

In 1993 the first sections of two extra tracks between Karlsruhe and Basel were introduced
for operation on the “Rheintalbahn”. In the following years more and more sections got into
operation. They are mostly located next to the existing railway line but also some of the
new sections are constructed next to the motorway A5 (example: bypass Freiburg for
freight trains) or use completely new corridors (like the Rastatt tunnel or the Katzenberg
tunnel). The sections between Rastatt and Offenburg are in operation. The sections
Karlsruhe – Rastatt and Offenburg – Basel are still in planning or partly under construction.
There are many objections against the project especially due to noise pollution reasons.

BMU and Intraplan Consult published a prediction about numbers of trains between
Offenburg and Basel. The study firstly comes to the result that about 1,300,000 people are
living in the affected area of the railway 26 line ([BVU INTRAPLAN 2008], page 11).

The following table gives the result of predicted numbers of trains for sample sections
(rural and urban areas).

The predictions for regional trains as well as for long distance trains come from existing
planning for extensions of public transport services.

The figures show that in the corridor the number of freight trains will rise about 100% in all
sections. In the Freiburg agglomeration, the number of regional trains also will rise. The
share of freight and passenger trains differs between agglomeration and rural areas. In
agglomerations the share of freight trains is about 50% whereas in rural areas the share
will rise up to 66%. So the influence on total noise is different.

The share of trains during day and night time for 2015 is shown in the following table.

At night the share of freight trains rises from 40 / 50% up to 81 / 85%. Almost 55% of
freight trains are operated at night. As night time is a period with a higher sensitivity to
noise this is important.

The figures show that a concentration on measures to reduce noise at the source - for
freight wagons, as the first step - is an important measure to reduce or avoid extra railway
noise.

The current situation is represented by the noise action plans of the cities of Freiburg and
Offenburg. In its noise action plan the city of Freiburg published the number of inhabitants
affected by railway noise.

According to the noise action plan, Deutsche Bahn is currently installing about 9 – 10 km of
noise protection walls and noise protection windows in about 1,500 apartments. The target
of Deutsche Bahn is to meet the emission levels of 70/72/75 dB(A) at day time and
60/62/65 dB(A) at night time (residential zones / mixed zones / industrial zones).

Actions for environmental railway noise mostly consider the building of a freight train
tunnel for the next section of the new Rheintalbahn and noise action plans in special areas.

Concerning the new built areas and sections of the third and fourth track, mostly noise
protection walls are foreseen. Discussions with the neighbours are often made due to
different opinions of calculation about the associated noise emissions and the resulting
number, length and height of noise protection walls. Especially the difference between the
calculation scheme for noise mapping according to Directive 2002/49/EB [VBUSch 2006]
and for new build infrastructure [Schall 2003] (for details see Section 2.5 on page 43) is
currently in discussion. The rail noise bonus which is still valid for German infrastructure
caused many struggles.

In Offenburg the planning foresees to build the new tracks along a new corridor through
the city. Noise emissions will affect many people. Alternatives like a tunnel solution are
presented by citizens´ initiatives. As this solution is very expensive it is refused by the
building owner. The current plans of the building owner were refused by the planning and
authorisation body (Regierungspräsident Freiburg) as they were not finished and could not
meet legal checks.

In Rastatt a tunnel already was planned but it was adjourned indefinitely at the beginning
of 2010. Local action groups are struggling against this as noise pollution in Rastatt is
expected. The Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development argues that
Rastatt is not a bottleneck and the building activities have to concentrate on the section
Offenburg – Basel.

In fact, for high frequency railway lines and, especially for construction of new railways, the
citizens become more and more aware of noise items. This must be kept in mind for all
planning.

4.1.2.     Alpine regions

4.1.2.1.   General aspects


This section provides general aspects concerning railway noise in Alpine and mountain
regions and presents details about two railway corridors in the Alps.

Important and interesting aspects about noise impacts in alpine regions come from the
ALPNAP project.

ALPNAP has been a European research project [ALPNAP 2007-2] funded by INTERREG IIIB
in ERDF Funds. The main target was to develop exact but also practical calculation methods
for air and noise pollution prediction. As there is a gap between difficult scientific
calculation and practical approach (easy formulas and assumption methods), the project
aimed at the development of methods that were acceptable and sufficiently precise.

The project partners made many measurements for pollution and environmental noise
emissions in defined areas like the Brenner corridor with Inn Valley and Edige/Etsch valley
and the Fréjus corridor with Maurienne valley and Susa valley.

Concerning environmental noise (in general) one important result of the project is that the
spread of noise depends on weather conditions and time of day. Examples are shown in the
following figures.

Figure 25:    Direction of sound spreading (sound rays) during day




                                               Source: ALPNAP 2007-1, page 10.


During the day, the temperature decreases with height and the sound is refracted upward.
In the dotted blue areas (“acoustical shadow zones”) on the valley bottom the noise is
reduced significantly because the upward refracted sound rays cannot reach there.

During the night, the temperature increases with height in an inversion layer (shown grey)
and the sound is refracted downward. Acoustical shadow zones do not appear. Instead the
sound is reflected at the ground.

Wind speeds and wind directions have an impact on environmental noise. Also, in valleys
reflections can spread environmental noise up to high altitudes. Mostly low frequencies are
spread very wide as higher frequencies are well absorbed by air.

The most severe problem for transportation and its emissions in mountain areas is that
transportation infrastructure (both rail and road) as well as residential or industrial zones
are concentrated in (partly narrow) valleys. So all sources of noise are located very close
together.

Noise in mountain regions is even more annoying or economically harmful as the area is
used for tourism which is an important employment factor.

The figures above also show one important incident for protection measures. As noise in
valleys can spread up to very high altitudes where also inhabitants can be affected by
noise, protection walls have a lower influence on noise reduction.

4.1.2.2.     Alpine regions - The Inn Valley


The Inn Valley between Kufstein and Innsbruck is the major access line to the Brenner
railway line where a tunnel has been planned for a long time. The Inn Valley was examined
in the ALPNAP project and will become more important for freight trains when the Brenner
tunnel is opened. An estimation of future rail traffic was made.

In the year 2005, 40 regional passenger trains, 16 long distance passenger trains,
([Kummer et al. 2006], page 24) and about 100 freight and RoLa-trains are operating on
the Brenner line. Taking into account the rise of freight trains - about 4.3% per year
between 1999 and 2005 - a total rise of about 52% is expected for 2015. ÖBB (Austrian
Federal Railway) expects 186 freight trains in 2016 ([Kummer et al. 2006], page 25).
Passenger trains will remain at about 46 regional and 26 long distance trains. This shows
that freight trains have a share of 64 to 68%. So they have the majority on the Brenner
line which affects the Inn Valley.

years ago noise emission inventories were compiled and on this basis plans for the
implementation and financing of noise abatement measures along railway lines were
developed. In recent years, the annual financial means amounted to some 30 million Euros.
It is expected to spend the same amount in the years to come as well. The costs are
carried 50% by the Austrian railways ÖBB and the remaining 50% by the federal states and
the community [ÖBB - BMVIT 2008].

Through this programme, Austria has realised considerably more protection measures as
foreseen in the first phase of the EU Noise Directive 2002/49/EC. In 2008, the programme
had achieved the following results:

In 2008, 72% of the citizens covered in the plans benefited from noise protection
measures. Since then, the size of the rail noise barriers has increased to some 1.7 million
sq. m [m2]; in 2011 two thirds of the planned construction works are completed and most
of the severely affected inhabitants are protected against noise. Through the continuation
of the programme, 10–15,000 additional citizens annually will be protected against rail
noise.

The effects of noise barriers in the mountainous Inn Valley can be seen on the map below,
where the inhabitants of the small town of Jenbach are protected against high noise levels
that show up in the unprotected outskirts of the settlement. However, the map shows as
well the effects of noise reflection from the adjacent mountains.

4.1.2.3.     Alpine regions – The Fréjus line


The Fréjus line is the rail freight corridor between France and Italy. Additional to this it is
part of the planned high speed and rail freight corridor between Lyon and Turin.

The Frésjus-Coridor, especially the Susa (between City of Susa and Modane) and the
Maurienne Valley (between Modane and Aiguebelle), was also examined in the ALPNAP
project. For the Fréjus line the numbers of daily trains on the Italian side (Susa Valley) of
the total line are published in [ALPNAP 2007-2] on page 241. The table is represented
below.

Here freight and goods trains have the majority on the main line, especially at night (as in
the Inn Valley) and in the sections between Bussoleno and Modane. The share of freight
trains is higher than on the Brenner line / in the Inn Valley.

The study has already shown that rolling noise is the most important environment noise
source from trains at speeds between 30 and 200 km/h and that freight trains are the
noisiest trains. Considering this, the most important starting point to lower noise,
particularly in mountain areas, is to avoid rolling noise directly at the original source
(contact zone of rail and wheel).

For the Fréjus Corridor the ALPNAP project produced a noise pollution index which shows
the number of people which are affected by a certain noise pollution index (see Figure 28).
The meaning of the indices is declared in Figure 29 and Figure 30.

The noise pollution index defined by ALPNAP project is represented in the following figures:

                 road sources

The NPI shows the exposure to noise in dependence of the LDEN noise level caused by both
road and rail traffic.

Although train traffic is high in the Fréjus-Corridor, about 30,000 out of 146,000 people
(see [Alpnap 2007-2] page 286) are affected by NPI levels higher than 1.

An interesting result of the ALPNAP Study is that a modal shift from road to rail will lead to
an increase of people affected by NPI 5 to NPI 6. The reason is that the motorways in the
Fréjus-Corridor are already well equipped with noise protection walls in populated areas in
comparison with the railway lines.

There are many protests against the project of a high speed railway line between Turin and
Lyon especially concerning the affected valleys. In detail the high-speed line will consist of
about 200 km new build railway lines including the new Mont-Cenis-Base-Tunnel (56 km).
This tunnel will completely pass by the Susa-Valley between Modane and Susa. On the
Italian side the Bussoleno-Tunnel will directly follow the Mont-Cenis-Base-Tunnel (12 km)
so only a short part of the railway line will remain outside in the area of Susa. On the
French side also two long tunnels (Bolledonne Tunnel, (20 km) and Chartreuse Tunnel
(20km – freight trains only) are foreseen passing by big parts of the Maurienne-Valley

[Transalpine]. With all these tunnels only short parts of the new line remain uncovered in
the Valleys.

Protests against this project concern air pollution (due to excavations of asbestos and
uranium), general threats for the nature of the valleys and disturbances due to building
works (15 – 20 years). During the building phase economic losses due to shrinking of
tourism in the affected areas are expected. Noise is also mentioned in some of the
publications but is not a main aspect of the protests. Most relevant are disturbances during
the building phase.

4.1.3.         United Kingdom

The UK uses a variety of noise mitigating technologies including noise barriers, rail
lubricators and friction modifiers, rail-tuned absorbers, and, usually in tunnels, resilient
base plates and floating slab track. Approximately 75% of the UK freight wagon fleet has
disc brakes or composite tread brakes instead of the noisier cast-iron tread-braked wheels.

In England 27 , 23 Noise Action Plans were designed to address the management of noise
issues and effects in agglomerations. According to these plans, 1.3 million inhabitants of
agglomerations are affected by rail noise; of these, 68% live in Greater London. Outside
agglomerations, only 4,000 inhabitants are included in Noise Action Plans.

The theoretical study in this section estimates the potential impact of building noise
barriers with 2m height along all railway lines in English agglomerations. It is assumed that
noise barriers reduce the noise levels by 5–10 dB(A). Due to these rough assumptions, only
the magnitude of the impact may be estimated. The number of affected inhabitants would
decrease by 54–84%. This implies that in English agglomerations only 200,000 to 600,000
inhabitants would be affected by rail noise, compared to 1.3 million without noise
protection measures. Figure 31 shows the range of impacts of noise barriers in English
agglomerations.

The environmental cost of rail noise in English agglomerations may be estimated at 144
million Euros per year. These costs would be reduced through the implementation of noise
barriers by annually 86 to 126 million Euros.

For rail noise protection in England it has been decided that the important areas with
respect to noise from major railways will be where the 1% of the population that are
affected by the highest noise levels from major railways are located according to the results
of the strategic noise mapping (“Important Areas”; see Figure 32). In addition, those
locations where the LAeq,18h is at least 73 dB(A) according to the results of the strategic
noise mapping have been identified as “First Priority Locations”. The following timeline for
railways was developed:

April 2010 – Oct 2011 Relevant rail authorities investigate Important Areas (giving priority
                      to those that contain First Priority Locations)
April 2011 onwards    Relevant rail authorities implement any actions or secure budget for
                      actions
April 2012 onwards    Relevant rail authorities investigate remaining Important Areas and
                      implement any actions or secure budget for actions

An example of Important Areas arising from the English Noise Action Planning is given in
Figure 32.

4.2.       Detailed analysis of selected sections

This section describes effects of noise reduction measures for selected sections of the rail
network. Assessments for effects of noise reductions are made with the use of defined
measures from Section 3.3 on page 53).

The authors made a general analysis of the sections as detailed examinations in real
situations were not possible. Some generalisations have been made. For example, noise
barriers were assumed to be built in each location where inhabitants are affected, not
taking into account if this will be technically feasible or whether installations already exist.
Therefore, a range of noise impacts of the different measures had to be defined as given in
Table 26. These figures were again adapted to the local conditions, i.e., used rolling stock,
number of trains and share of train types (long distance, regional, freight trains). For
replacement of cast iron by composite block brakes or equipment of freight cars with wheel
absorbers, a 100% endowment of all relevant wagons is assumed.

Calculations were made with the actual state and the if-case (if-case = the measure is
introduced completely in the section).

The following elaboration also includes an assumption of noise reduction effects by
reduction of external rail noise costs. For cost calculation the same method was applied as
the study “External Costs of Transport in Europe 2008” commissioned by the International
Railway Union (UIC) in 2011 [CE Delft et al. 2011]. The study quantifies the monetary
impacts of steady noise exposure of people at different levels by a review of European
studies of housing prices and assesses additional medical costs by the increased risk of
cardiac infarctions based on latest epidemiological research. The resulting non-linear noise
exposure cost function is then applied to national statistics on noise affected inhabitants by
5 dB(A) LDEN noise classes.

4.2.1.       The Rhine Axis section Koblenz – Bingen

The selected section between Koblenz and Bingen represents an area in a narrow valley
with high frequency railway lines on one of the main European transportation corridors (see
also Section 4.1.1 on page 71).

The location of the section is given in Figure 33. The valley has four tracks, two on each
river bank. The essential data and results of the assessment are given in Table 27.

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

In this section of the Rhine Valley, nearly 68,000 people are affected by rail noise above 55
dB(A). Rail noise causes damages in the order of 11 million Euros per year. However, these
may be reduced significantly: The strongest impacts are achieved through the construction
of noise barriers. If - theoretically - the whole valley were protected, only 17,000–36,000
inhabitants will still be affected afterwards and the environmental costs will be reduced by
47%–72% (Figure 33). However, this would imply considerable costs, as well as strong
visual intrusions. If new brake blocks were implemented, the environmental costs could be
reduced by 51-57%. The lower value is due to the fact that passenger trains are not
affected by this measure. Wheel absorbers reduce environmental costs by 21-58%.

4.2.2.        United Kingdom section Thameslink near Blackfriars in London

In order to have an example about a railway line in a dense populated agglomeration with
a large frequency of trains per hour, Thameslink was chosen as a case study. Rail noise of
railway lines in metropolises by nature affects a lot of people. So it is very important to find
good solutions for inner-city lines. Thameslink is considered to be a good example because
it represents an area with dense population and a planned extension of traffic.

Thameslink runs through the heart of London, crossing the River Thames at Blackfriars
Bridge, operating along a 225km route between Bedford in the north and Brighton on the
south coast. The service stops at King’s Cross / St Pancras International, Luton Airport and
Gatwick Airport, and an offshoot (the Wimbledon Loop) passes through south-west London.
An estimated 75000 people every day use Thameslink to get in and out of London.

Thameslink 2000 is a £5.5bn programme 28 to increase service capacity and frequency on
the Thameslink route, with longer trains and eventually new rolling stock. The route from
St Pancras to London Bridge is being upgraded, and Blackfriars station is being rebuilt to

span the river, with a new entrance on the south bank; the station will be ready for 12-car
trains by December 2011, and completed in time for the 2012 Olympics. The Thameslink
2000 project was originally proposed in 1991, and, following a public inquiry in 2005,
planning permission was finally granted in 2006.

As a result of the public inquiry, many of the relevant documents are available to the public
through the Inquiry’s website 29 or on request.

As part of the Environmental Impact Assessment, Temple Environmental consultants Ltd
produced the ‘Noise & Vibration Specialist Report’ in June 2004 [Thameslink 2004], and the
‘Blackfriars Noise Assessment Report’ in 2005 [Thameslink 2005]. These reports include
calculations and predictions of rail noise, using ISVR’s NORBERT 30 model, and make
recommendations regarding the use of noise mitigation technologies.

One of the goals of the Thameslink programme is to run 24 trains per hour, each way,
between Blackfriars and St Pancras Midland Road; and 18 trains per hour, each way,
between Blackfriars and London Bridge. Blackfriars Railway Bridge is a steel decked bridge
across the Thames (see Figure 34 and Figure 35) with ballasted track. In 2004, the traffic
across the bridge during the day was 233 Thameslink trains and 133 other trains; during
the night, the traffic was 39 Thameslink trains and 11 other trains. The target is to increase
this to 672 Thameslink trains and 70 other trains during the day, and 74 Thameslink trains
during the night.

In addition to increasing the number of trains, capacity will be further increased by
replacing 8-car trains with 12-car trains during peak hours; during off-peak hours, 4-car
trains will be replaced by 8-car trains. To some extent the increase in noise from the
additional traffic will be offset by the introduction of quieter rolling stock. In 2004,
Thameslink operated Class 319 EMUs primarily, and have since acquired all Class 319
vehicles still operational 31 . These are disc-braked; the last of the Class 421 and 423 EMUs
with cast iron tread brakes were phased out during 2004. The Class 319 fleet was
manufactured during 1987-90. First Capital Connect (who took over the Thameslink
franchise in 2006) have recently acquired 23 Class 377/5 EMU 4-car trains (Electrostars),

     The Class 319 is a dual-voltage EMU, and therefore able to operate both north of the River Thames, which uses
     a 25kV AC overhead supply, and south of the river, which uses a 750V DC third rail.

manufactured in 2008-09. The train noise correction for the Class 377/5 is 8.4 dB(A),
compared to 11.3 dB(A) for the Class 319.

Regarding further rolling stock noise mitigation measures:

   x   wheel dampers may provide a cost-effective means of reducing curve squeal and
       flange contact noise;
   x   for vehicle mounted lubricators or wheel dampers Network Rail will work with TOCs
       and other stakeholders to install them to the existing rolling stock where it is found
       that such measures are reasonably practicable.

However, the EMUs are disc-braked and there is little scope to reduce rolling noise; future
design innovations in the suspension systems are not expected to reduce ground borne
noise and vibration; and, in general, train speed is not an effective means of vibration
reduction.

Noise level projections for 2026, with or without the Thameslink upgrade, were used to
assess the impact of noise on local properties. The Thameslink programme was predicted to
reduce the number of affected residential properties from 44 to 24, and the number of non-
residential properties from 14 to 8. In either case, the majority of these impacts are either
slight or moderate. The reason why so few properties are affected is that, even close to the
railway, rail noise does not dominate over the ambient noise level. Predicted noise level
increases near Blackfriars Railway Bridge are shown in Figure 37.

One distinctive source of noise at Blackfriars is the jointed track, which gives rise to the
characteristic ‘pounding’ noise. Removal of joints will reduce the noise level by about 3.1
dB(A), and will significantly improve the subjective impression of the bridge noise.
Regarding track renewals and remodelling between Blackfriars and London Bridge:

   x   All jointed track will be removed as far as practical where track is renewed and
       replaced with Continuously Welded Rail or Long Welded Rail. Any unnecessary
       Switches and Crossings (S&Cs) will be removed and joints to remaining S&Cs will be
       welded. All new or replacement expansion joints will be scarfed.

Another source of noise, about 6 dB(A), is flange contact on the curve south of the bridge
(Falcon Point). As part of the renewal programme, this section will be replaced with modern
track to a high specification, avoiding sudden changes in curvature at rail joints. Where
necessary, flange lubricators will be installed or replaced.

Network Rail has a regular inspection and maintenance programme, and is committed to
removing any corrugation. In addition, vehicles are monitored for wheel flats. No significant
benefit in noise level is expected from imposing more frequent grinding or an enhanced
wheel set maintenance regime.

Where effective and safe, Network Rail is willing to use rail dampers 32 . However, rail
damping is not effective when used with stiff rail pads. In the Blackfriars area (in 2005),
the rail was supported on stiff pads or no pads at all. Rail dampers would not have affected
the bridge noise component, and only a 0.8 dB(A) reduction would have been achieved in
the direct rolling noise.

Noise barriers are a visual intrusion, particularly since they are a target for graffiti; they
have a high cost, and cause problems for track access. Their effectiveness depends on their
absorption properties, their height, and the proximity of the barrier to the noise source
and/or to the receiver. At Blackfriars, noise barriers will not be particularly effective since
the railway is multiple-track, and many of the affected properties overlook the track.
However, the new station roof will incorporate sound absorbent material which will help to
increase the noise attenuation provided by the barriers, and a new Vitreous enamel clad
Bridge 412 enclosure will shield 1 Puddle Dock.

A variety of noise mitigating trackforms were considered for reducing noise levels around
the Blackfriars Railway Bridge, including ballast mats (which can be problematic for
maintenance and tamping), resilient baseplates, booted sleepers, and Pandrol’s VANGUARD
(which clamps the rail around the web and under the head, as well as under the foot) on
ballasted track; and slab track with soft rail pads or baseplates. While these track designs
reduce noise levels significantly when compared with the reference design, they do not
provide any meaningful reduction in overall train noise levels. At Falcon Point, railway noise
is expected to reduce by 3–4 dB at the upper floors closest to the Bridge. This benefit
would affect some 6 dwellings. The cost will be disproportionately high in relation to the
scale of the potential benefit. There is no justification to install resilient baseplates on
Blackfriars Railway Bridge.


4.2.3.         Noise Impact of High Speed Lines in the UK

The East Coast Mainline (ECML) operates between Edinburgh and London King’s Cross and
the West Coast Mainline (WCML) operates between Glasgow and London Euston. The lines
are rated for 200 km/h for the most part, and even for 225 km/h in places. However, UK
legislation requires in-cab signalling for train speeds over 200 km/h, which has prevented
operation at 225 km/h on these lines. Currently the only line in the UK operating at speeds
over 200 km/h is High Speed 1 (HS1). High Speed 2 (HS2) is currently in the early
planning stages and is expected to start operation in 2025.

4.2.3.1.       High speed 1 (HS1)
High Speed 1 is the route from London to the Channel Tunnel which started operation in
2007. After leaving St Pancras, the line crosses the ECML and immediately enters a tunnel
which passes underneath London for 20 km (line speed for this stretch is 230 km/h, but
other tunnels on the route have a speed limit of 270 km/h); the bridge across the ECML to
the tunnel entrance is fully enclosed by a tube with acoustic grey cladding to shield the
local environment from noise (although this is not completely effective). Pandrol’s
VANGUARD and a variety of other noise mitigation technologies are implemented along the
route: noise bunds and barriers (including low barriers on viaducts), Sateba booted sleeper
track system (Slab track SAT SB12), and GERB’s floating slab track (also used in London’s
Docklands Light Railway).

     Blackfriars Station will be the first site in the UK to install Tata Steel’s SilentTrack noise damping system – this

____________________________________________________________________________________________

There is no noise map for HS1, but there are a few comments on noise in the written
evidence in the Transport Committee HS2 report:

   x   ‘experience in Kent and elsewhere shows how the noise footprint of HSR trains can
       be mitigated’

   x   ‘the experience of HS1 is that fears expressed before its construction have mostly
       not been realised’

   x   ‘it would appear from the lack of complaints related to HS1 operation that the noise
       impact can be overrated by objectors at the planning stage’

   x   ‘HS1’s impact has been masked to some extent by the route passing close to
       existing busy roads’

Overall, HS1 has been a positive development with very few complaints about noise.

4.2.3.2.   High Speed 2 (HS2)
This section refers to the Tenth Report of Session 2010-12 of the House of Commons
Transport Committee, regarding High Speed Rail (HSR), specifically High Speed 2 (HS2),
and associated written evidence. HS2 is planned for 2025.

Remit:
‘HS2 Ltd was established as a Government company to examine the case and develop
proposals for a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands, and
potentially beyond. Its remit was to identify a route between London and the West Midlands
with the primary aims of increasing passenger capacity on the corridor and optimising
journey times. It was a requirement of the remit that the route should include an
interchange between HS2, the Great Western Main Line and Crossrail, with convenient
access to Heathrow.’

Proposal:
‘HS2 Ltd has proposed a London – West Midlands route that avoids any significant
demolition of property except for the Euston station area; about half the route would be in
deep cutting or tunnel, to reduce noise and visual intrusion on adjacent areas.’ The
proposal focuses on 400 km/h high speed rail route. This is expected to free up capacity on
the West Coast Mainline and allow greater rail freight utilisation.

Noise Issues:
No Environmental Impact Assessment has been carried out for HS2, and none is planned
until after the current consultation exercise. An Appraisal of Sustainability (AoS) has been
published which includes a technical report on noise and vibration.

Following England’s Noise Action Plan and the Noise Insulation (Railways and Other Guided
Transport Systems) Regulations, the noise measure LAeq,18h (noise averaged over the
period 06.00–24.00) has been used as the primary indicator of noise level, with an imposed
limit of 73 dB – since noise levels higher than this would make the route a ‘First Priority
Location’, i.e., an immediate target for noise mitigation.

While such a strategy might be acceptable for already noisy areas, part of the proposed
route runs through an Area of Natural Beauty (AONB) where the environmental impact of
the railway is a major concern. Consequently, there has been fierce opposition to HS2
along this section of the route, including complaints about noise levels:

    x   ‘Acceptable’ noise levels do not follow WHO guidelines or English Planning
        Permission (PPG24) guidelines. The latter would limit noise levels to 66 dB, or even
        less considering the rural environment. The former recommends that peak noise
        levels be considered, not just the average, and for high speed trains the difference
        between these is large.

    x   Concern over the visual impact of noise barriers, coupled with the concern that
        these will not block aerodynamic noise from pantographs. In addition, in the noise
        prediction modelling, pantograph noise has been modelled as a noise source at rail
        track height, which is not appropriate and underestimates the noise impact. (The
        AoS assumes a 3 dB reduction in noise emissions based on improved noise control
        measures in future rolling stock, and notes the importance of mitigating the source
        of aerodynamic noise. 100 km of 2–3 metre high noise barriers are included in the
        model.)

    x   The noise impact from the ground-borne Raleigh shock wave of high-speed trains
        travelling at 400 km/h over flood plains, soft alluvial ground, etc., has not been
        considered, nor has the cost of mitigation measures against this.

    x   The number of trains used in the noise modelling is 432 per day, but the potential
        train throughput could be up to 576 trains. The system needs to be modelled at full
        operational capacity, otherwise noise regulations will put a severe constraint on
        route utilisation.

    x   Noise modelling has been carried out for a maximum speed of 360 km/h, even in
        places where the design speed is higher.

In summary, the HS2 assessment of noise levels both uses an arguably too-high definition
of acceptable noise level, and underestimates noise levels arising from pantographs,
ground-borne shock waves and full system capacity. This highlights the need for a full
Environmental Impact Assessment and a clearer remit on noise and vibration levels in the
AONB.

The strongest arguments against HS2 can be countered by lowering the line speed from
400 km/h to, e.g., 240 km/h in sensitive areas. Although this will increase journey time,
and weakens the economic case for HS2, it will significantly reduce the environmental
impact of construction and of operational noise and energy requirements. A lower design
speed also allows the route to follow the existing M1 motorway, further reducing
environmental impact.

5.            EVALUATION

                                               KEY FINDINGS

     x    There are different possibilities for financial support and regulative activities to
          foster the introduction of noise reduction measures.

     x    Noise depending track access charges are one possibility next to direct support
          for low noise measures.

     x    Noise depending track access charges shall bear in mind that relevant noise
          reduction effects are only coming from trains which are (nearly) completely
          equipped with low noise rolling stock and that noise reduction measures may cause
          extra operative costs (next to investment cost).

     x    Regulation can focus on the TSI Noise where noise limits for new rolling stock are
          regulated. They shall be compulsory for existing rolling stock after about 10 –
          12 years and lowered from time to time according to latest technical possibilities.

     x    Currently Switzerland and the Netherlands have introduced noise depending
          track access charges, Germany is planning to introduce them at the end of the year
          2012.

     x    Competitiveness of rail transport in comparison with other transportation means
          must be borne in mind in all activities, so all financial and regulative measures shall
          not burden the rail sector.



This chapter describes and evaluates different methods for financial support of noise
reduction measures with the focus on promoting the retrofitting of freight wagons with new
braking systems. This is currently the most important discussion. Regulation possibilities
are also discussed.

5.1.          Economic incentives

Economic incentives through rail track charging differentiated according to noise emissions
can help to:

     x    stimulate the use of low-noise technology for the rolling stock,
     x    foster the use of routes which avoid hot spots for noise and
     x    foster noise-reducing operational routines and speeds in sensitive areas.

In general, there are two possibilities for the design of mark-ups for noise emissions: First,
the mark-ups can be added to the rail infrastructure charges of high noise polluters while
low noise polluters would be free of additional charges. In this case revenues are generated
which can be used for subsidising noise abatement investments for railway cars. 33 Second,
the mark-ups can be designed in a way that they are neutral with respect to the total
burdens from rail track charging, i.e., additional charges would be levied on high noise

33
     We discount the option to allocate the revenues to the infrastructure manager, because they do not reflect
     infrastructure costs.

polluters while low noise polluters would receive a bonus. Penalty and bonus payments
would balance after aggregation. This scheme would be comparable to the charging scheme
for heavy goods vehicles on motorways according to Directive 2006/38/EC (variant of
differentiating the charges on the base of EURO emissions standards).

The recast of Railway Directive 2001/14/EC foresees the differentiation of rail track charges
according to noise (see [Com(2010) 475] Article 31. There are several options to be
analysed:

     x    Differentiation of rail track charges according to measured noise emissions (see
          Section 5.1.1 );
     x    Differentiation of charges for wagons according to their noise classification (see
          Section 5.1.2 );
     x    Differentiation of charges for trains according to the composition of wagons (see
          Section 5.1.3 );
     x    Bonus payments for new and retrofitted cars (see Section 5.1.4 );
     x    Combined bonus systems (see Section 5.1.5 ).


5.1.1.         Differentiation of rail track charges according to measured noise
               emissions

The object of charging would be the train. The train-related noise emissions would have to
be measured at critical points in densely populated areas and/or low distances to
residential zones and then allocated to the train. The noise mark-up for the track charge
then would vary with the noise level, eventually in a progressive way.

Such a scheme would perfectly implement the polluter-pays principle. It works
independently from the car or wheel technology and cannot be manipulated by wrong
classification or changing electronic identification plates. However, it would require many
measurement posts or gentries alongside the tracks and a complex information, payment
and administration system. As a result, the implementation cost of such a system could be
very high. 34

As the charge will be paid initially by the train operator, the question is open how the train
operator (the railway enterprise) will pass on the costs to the cars’ owners/operators or to
the shippers.


5.1.2.         Differentiation of charges for wagons according to their noise
               classification

The simplest way to differentiate track charges according to noise is to classify the wagons
into noise categories and charge each wagon separately with a noise mark-up. The train
operator would pay the charge to the infrastructure manager and send the bill to the car
owner or operator.




34
     Some form of infrastructure for dynamic measurement and reporting of vehicle noise may be necessary
     anyway to reflect changes in the vehicle’s status, e.g., wheel out-of-roundness, which significantly affect noise
     levels; this could be coupled with existing trackside measuring stations. Higher-than-expected noise levels may
     indicate an urgent need for vehicle maintenance.

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

This scheme presupposes the introduction of noise standards for rail wagons (comparable
to EURO categories for road vehicles) and a rail-car-based km charge. While the technology
of charging, control and monitoring can be kept simple there is one serious caveat: The
noise emission curve is shaped in a strictly concave way (“diminishing marginal noise
emissions”) with increasing share of low noise cars. This means that a 50% share of low
noise cars in a train will lead to a noise reduction of only 1.5 dB(A) compared with a high
noise train, so that the exposed population will hardly notice the progress. The share of low
noise cars should be very high to achieve a significant noise reduction of a train. If, for
instance, 100% of freight cars are equipped with silent brakes the noise reduction can be
as much as 10 dB(A), which implies cutting noise by half. 35

In conclusion, this scheme is simple to implement, but does not fully reflect the polluter-
pays principle, i.e., a train composed of 50% low noise cars would pay reduced charges for
50% of the cars although the noise reduction is negligible. There is a risk, furthermore, that
identification plates (e.g., RFIDs) are manipulated to get wagons classified in favourable
categories.


5.1.3.         Differentiation of charges for trains according to the composition of
               wagons

To avoid the caveats mentioned in Section 5.1.2 on page 94, an alternative is to classify
the trains instead of the wagons. In this case, the trains will be classified on the basis of
the rail car types from which they are composed. This presupposes the introduction of noise
standards for rail wagons (as in 5.1.2 on page 94) and, in addition, the classification of
trains on the basis of the expected noise emissions.

In the case of freight trains, the problem arises that the emission category of a train would
vary with every change of the train composition in marshalling yards (single wagon traffic).
Indeed, the problem is that only block trains which do not change wagon types from start
to end can be easily classified. In single wagon transport, this classifying is much more
difficult as train composition changes with every shunting activity. If charging followed the
polluter-pays principle, then adding a few high-noise cars to a low-noise train would imply a
very high mark-up for the train, while adding a low-noise car to a high-noise train would
not lead to a change of the train charge. This will not be accepted by the market players
(i.e.: investment in low noise cars will not pay if these cars are often integrated in high
noise trains), so such a scheme should be modified in a more pragmatic way.

Nevertheless, the problem remains that the railway undertaking would have to charge the
car owners/operators/shippers, accordingly.


5.1.4.         Bonus payments for new and retrofitted cars

Against the background of the manifold problems of noise-related rail track charging and
the possible second round effect of losing market share to road transport, if the noise
charges are really high but lead to the desired noise reduction, the easiest way to come to
low noise technologies is to pay public subsidies for new low-noise cars and for retrofitting
used cars. Certainly this is the approach which will be most readily accepted by the market
players.

While this burden should not fall on the tax payer, nevertheless this instrument can be an
element of an overall strategy to introduce an incentive-based system and to achieve a
high rate of penetration within a short period of time – much shorter than the lifetime of
railway cars, which can be estimated at about 40 years.


5.1.5.       Combined bonus systems

Whenever charging schemes are considered, companies worry about higher costs and the
possibility of losing market shares to the road transport mode. This is a relevant argument,
in particular in a political environment which aims at increasing rail freight market shares
for environmental reasons and to meet climate challenges.

Public financial assistance should be given in the initial phase of a charging scheme with
noise mark-ups. This could be implemented by a bonus payment for the purchase of new
cars which are equipped with noise reducing technology, and/or for retrofitting used cars.


5.1.6.       Current status of track charges

As the European Commission has decided on 27 September 2011 to allow charging for
emissions of road vehicles (see Directive 2011/76/EU of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 27 September 2011, amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of
heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, as published OJEU L 269 on
14.10.11 [Dir. 2011/76/EU]) the way is also free for track charges according to noise
emissions on railways without regard for total earning of the infrastructure company (see
Recast of Railway Directive 2001/14/EC in [Com(2010) 475] Article 31).

The European Commission established a working group in 2011 to harmonise and
implement Trace Access Charge systems including noise depending instruments. The
recommendations from this study shall be considered by this group.

UIC has published (in [UIC 2010]) an overview about the current status of noise abatement
legislation in different countries. The Netherlands and Switzerland already have track
charges with a noise bonus and penalty. Since 2002, Switzerland has granted a bonus for
all wagons which are equipped with low noise brakes of 0.01 CHF (0.0075 €, exchange rate
November 2010) per axle-kilometre. The bonus is financed by the state, as well as the
retrofitting programme of all Swiss wagons. The Netherlands grants a bonus of 0.04 € per
wagon kilometre for all low noise wagons. The bonus is granted for two years up to a total
maximum of 4,800 € per wagon.

In Germany, a system will be introduced in 2012 in which a bonus will be granted only to
single freight wagons which are newly retrofitted with low noise equipment like composite
brake blocks after the introduction of the bonus scheme. Furthermore, a bonus is planned
for whole freight trains which consist of only low noise wagons. In this second part of the
bonus scheme, new and recently retrofitted wagons are also considered. Both parts of the
bonus will be realised as a discount on the track charge according to wagon kilometres.
This will be granted directly from the infrastructure company to the wagon owner.

In Switzerland there is a discussion about modifying the existing system. Both the German
and Swiss plans include a funding of owners of low-noise freight cars. The funding will be
organised and calculated by the infrastructure companies. They rely on the owner notifying

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

which freight cars are low-noise. The funding depends on axle-kilometres in both countries.
There are also discussions about the costs for the implementation and operation of the
accounting system. For VDV (in [KCW 2011]), KCW calculated the operating costs for
different kinds of funding systems for low-noise freight wagons. Funding for new wagons
which are equipped with LL-blocks (if they are admitted) is currently being discussed.

In detail, Germany plans to fund retrofitted freight cars with 0.0028 € per axle-kilometre on
German tracks up to a total of 1,688 € per axle. The total comes from estimated
investment costs of about 2,120 € per axle minus 432 € as opportunity saving for
replacement of an old cast iron block by a new one. The costs for the bonus will be covered
50% by the German state and 50% by a general increase of track prices for all freight
trains.

In a study for the European Commission, KCW proposes a funding of 0.008 € per axle-
kilometre for K-block equipped wagons and 0.0025 € per axle-kilometre for LL-block
equipped wagons [KCW 2009]. The figures mentioned are for a funding period of 8 years.
For a potential funding period of 12 years the figures are 0.0045 € per axle-kilometre for K-
blocks and 0.002 € for LL-blocks.

Irmhild Saabel from WASCOSA AG held a presentation at Forum Güterwagen (forum freight
wagons) in May 2011 about costs coming from K-blocks [Saabel 2011]. The total costs for
blocks and wheels increase by a factor of 1.5 to 2.6. Although K-blocks have a life cycle of
about 110,000 to 130,000 km, the wheels need reprofiling each 120,000 to 310,000 km
(instead of 450,000 to 500,000 km) and have a life cycle of about only 360,000 to
1,140,000 km (instead of 2,700,000 to 3,500,000 km). Also Mr Gilliam from the AAE
reports higher operating costs, from first experiences, caused by abrasion of wheels with
modified blocks 36 .

Costs for railway undertakings or wagon owners, related to composite brake blocks, arise
not only from investment but also from operating.

To harmonise NDTAC on an EU-wide scale in 2011, the Commission established an expert
group under the DERC Committee [Rapacz 2011].

     x    The main aim: to discuss and propose practical solutions on how to harmonise
          NDTAC schemes across Member States, focusing on financial aspects.

     x    The result of the work of the group could be a set of guidelines for the Member
          States on NDTAC harmonisation / implementing measure adopted by the
          Commission on the basis of the recast.

     x    The group is to be restarted in 2012, following the recast developments.

5.2.         Analysis of regulation possibilities

The number of regulations on railway noise in the EU Member States is large. A brief
overview of the national noise measures is listed in Annex IV.

In 2003, the Working Group on Railway Noise of the European Commission [EC 2003] was
of the opinion that “a solution to the major railway noise issues is possible within 10 years
if the proposals are implemented as a cost-effective combination of the instruments
described”.

The most relevant standardisation issues for railway rolling stock have been formulated in
the TSI documents (Technical Specifications for Interoperability). In the latest TSI Noise
[TSI Noise 2011], the following regulations for noise emissions of rail vehicles are defined:

    x    Limits for stationary and pass-by noise for freight wagons and locomotives (for
         details see Annex II of this study),
    x    Operation and maintenance rules,
    x    Application to new rolling stock, and
    x    Retrofitting programmes.

While the rail noise problem is well understood and the technical possibilities are clearly
described in the European Commission documents, a timetable for introducing new noise
standards – comparable to the Euro standards for HGVs – is missing until now. However,
because rail cars are clustered tightly (i.e., grouped as trains), the equipping of rail cars
with low noise technology is only effective if a large proportion of the cars use this
technology (see Section 1.2 on page 15).

Retrofitting the current freight fleet with composite brake blocks will be a slow process
since a charging scheme is required that creates an incentive to retrofit without increasing
the overall cost of rail freight transport relative to other transport modes. The planned
funding in Germany (see Section 5.1.6 on page 96) is not attractive enough for a part of
wagon owners, since a negative impact on railway transport costs would be inevitable.

Therefore, developing a regulation scheme for a staged process towards low-noise rolling
stock must be the heart of a noise abatement strategy for railways. The economic
instruments developed in Section 5.1 on page 93 then would serve as incentive engines, for
instance as a motivation for top runners to start early with retrofitting or purchasing new
noise-reduced cars and for the followers to reduce their costs.


5.2.1.       Regulating technology for noise emissions?

Currently the discussion focuses on the braking system of rail cars. Most noise in railway
operations is caused by rough running surfaces of wheels and tracks. If both can be kept
smooth, noise can be reduced significantly [CER UIC 2007]. The conventional cast-iron
brake blocks cause a fast deterioration of wheels and rough wheel surfaces and high noise
levels are a consequence. If this braking technology can be exchanged by modern
composite brake blocks the noise emissions can be reduced by up to 10 dB(A).

Retrofitting with composite brake blocks targets brake noise and elevated rolling noise, but
there are other sources of noise, locations which require an even greater noise reduction



                                                        98
                                                                  Reducing Railway Noise Pollution
____________________________________________________________________________________________

than can be gained by retrofitting alone, and there are many railway vehicles which do not
have cast-iron tread brakes. Noise reduction can also be achieved by rail- and wheel-tuned
absorbers and other technical measures. Furthermore, technological development may
yield new technologies in the next years to come. This brings up the question whether the
regulation towards a particular noise reduction technology makes sense. In any case, the
regulation should allow for alternative technologies if they have proved to achieve at least
the same reduction performance. The Japanese Top-runner scheme gives an example for
an incentive compatible regulation scheme. The current best technology is set as a
standard in the medium term (e.g.: 5–7 years).

An alternative way of regulation consists of setting upper limits for local noise emissions.
Directive 2002/49/EC gives the basic definitions of indicators, methods of measurement
and mapping of exposed population. The Member States are obliged to identify hot spots
where noise limits are exceeded and to prepare action plans not later than July 2013. The
national legislation for noise control is well developed for new investments which lead to
additional traffic and noise production. The big challenge remaining is the noise protection
of population alongside existing railway tracks. In principle it would be possible to prepare
a noise directive comparable to the Air Quality Directives 1999/30 and 2008/50, which limit
the local concentration of exhaust emissions like NOx and PM. Analogously, a noise quality
directive could limit the noise levels alongside the tracks at maximum thresholds,
depending on the environment and the exposed population.

The advantage of emission dependent regulation is that the industry is free to find the best
technologies to meet the limit values set. A disadvantage is that it will take some time to
achieve a consensus of the Member States on noise limit values. After the painful
experiences gained with the introduction of Directive 1999/30 (Council Directive
1999/30/EC of 22 April 1999 relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide
and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air) one can expect that the
Member States will check such values carefully to avoid massive investments in their
transport infrastructure for noise abatement.

Therefore, the most promising way for the medium term future is to start from the platform
of TSIs and the Recast of the Railway Packages (see [TSI Noise 2011] and [Com(2010)
475]). This can be formulated in a way that the expected noise reduction is clearly defined
while the technology used is not specified in detail, leaving options open for technological
progress.


5.2.2.     Regulation authorities

The European Railway Agency (ERA), established in 2006 in Valenciennes following the
second railway package, is responsible for TSIs and can take responsibility for developing
the appropriate noise regulation for railway cars as well. This regulation can be controlled
by the national railway regulation authorities – following the first railway package the
establishment of national railway regulators is obligatory for each Member State.

From this follows that the existing national bodies can be involved in the control of rail
noise emissions more intensively and with the necessary administrative power. A close
coordination with the road and air transport regulators is necessary to avoid market
distortions stemming from unbalanced regulation.

5.3.         Analysis of stakeholder remarks on economic incentives
             and regulation

Since it is not possible to reflect the position of each railway stakeholder in Europe within
this framework, the position of the International Railway Union (UIC) is provided. UIC
makes frequent statements of the issue which generally acknowledge the need for noise
reduction measures. UIC favours the following strategies [UIC 2010]:
    x Reduce the noise of all new freight vehicles by introducing TSI limit values.

    x   Promote the retrofitting of existing freight vehicles with composite brake blocks.

    x   Build noise barriers and install noise insulated windows.

    x   Pursue further solutions in special cases such as acoustic rail grinding, rail
        absorbers, wheel absorbers, friction modification against curve squeal, etc. The
        precondition is regular maintenance.

UIC considers LL-brake blocks to be a “promising noise reduction measure; however they
still require further improvement before they can be used on a large scale in Europe”.

Other options, such as speed limits and land-use planning are rejected [UIC 2008]. Speed
limits need to be substantial (50 km/h) to have a considerable noise impact and thus “are
not compatible with the operation of a commercially competitive railway”. Land-use
planning measures are of little effect, since at distances further than 50 metres from the
source “noise level is insensitive to even medium changes in distance”.

UIC's main concern is that noise reduction measures might burden the railways in a
manner that the competition with the road sector is distorted. The burden may be created
either through high investment costs or excessive administrative tasks. “Due to fierce
competition, wagon owners do not have sufficient resources to finance the retrofitting of
their fleet. Any incentive system should neither weaken the overall market share of the
freight sector nor disadvantage any freight market player” [UIC 2011].

Therefore, the cost efficiency of the measures (see Section 5.1 on page 93) is a major UIC
decision criterion. For example, the retrofitting with composite brake blocks is considered
as more efficient than the construction of noise barriers. UIC argues that an incentive
scheme should be developed, where public funds for retrofitting are diverted from the
railway network operators to the wagon owners. Additionally, UIC criticises the above-
mentioned studies commissioned by the EU [PWC 2007] and [KCW et al. 2009] for its “too
low cost assumptions related to the use of composite brake blocks. These assumptions
combined with too high an estimate of the average annual mileage may lead to a
differential track access charge which is insufficient for promoting retrofitting.”

Since direct funding does not take into account the wagon mileage, [UIC 2011] proposes a
bonus system combined with access charges: “national authorities should fund the
retrofitting of freight wagons by means of a noise reduction bonus … [which] would be
granted based on the mileage travelled on lines of the respective national networks. The
bonus would compensate the investment costs as well as the additional operating,
transaction and administrative costs.”

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

In an interview with the authors in July 2011, Mr Kerth from VDV mentioned that the total
costs for retrofitting are about 0.008 € per axle-km if the additional operating costs and
financing costs are included in the calculation. Currently, the interest of the wagon owners
in retrofitting existing wagons due to this funding scheme is very low. A problem for the rail
sector can also rise because part of the financing of the bonus system will be financed by
an increase of track prices for the total freight train sector. This increase also affects
existing wagons which are already equipped with composite brake blocks. The press release
of VDV and VPI concerning the financing of the bonus from July 5th 2011 announces the
50% share of the rail sector as unfair [VDV VPI 2011]. It is the first time a transportation
mode would be burdened by costs for noise and it would only fund recently retrofitted
wagons, while existing low-noise or new-build wagons have to carry the increased track
prices.

In general, the planned funding scheme in Germany is accepted by the rail sector as it is a
direct funding of wagon owners and the system is not too complicated. The implementation
costs seem to be acceptable (see the elaborations in [KCW 2011]). Nevertheless, many
details still have to be clarified and agreed, such as the size of the bonus and its financing.
Also the inclusion of additional operating costs is still in discussion. If they are included, this
could lead to a lower share of the German state as this part of the funding is limited to 152
million Euros per year [VDV-2011-2]. VDV expects only 15% share of costs will be carried
by the Germany state if the additional operating costs remain to the rail sector.

UIC, CER, UIRR, ERFA, EIM and UIP comment in their position paper on a Consultation
document of the Commission concerning rail noise abatement measures in 2007 [UIC et al.
2007]. In this respect they point out that the funding scheme should not burden the rail
freight sector with additional costs and the funding and monitoring scheme should not be
cost-intensive itself.

6.          CONCLUSIONS

Reducing railway noise is an important activity for the environment and citizens' health in
Europe and for the acceptance of the railways as a driving force for ecological and
economic development of Europe. Therefore, the acceptance of railways by citizens living
near railway lines, especially the main rail freight corridors, is vital.

In freight corridors, the number of trains will increase, and so noise for the citizens will
increase as well. Therefore, measures to reduce noise levels are essential to prevent health
risks and to have the acceptance of the neighbours. Without this acceptance, the risk
remains that the increase of capacity on main railway lines will be inhibited for a long
period of time, which will cause losses for the rail sector and for the total economy.

6.1.        Recommendations of measures

The recommendations cover the following three main aspects, considering the revival of the
rail sector as one of the most important measures for greening transportation and meeting
climate change targets:

     x   identifying effective technical measures;
     x   providing effective regulation and economic incentive schemes which do not distort
         competition with other transportation modes;
     x   funding the necessary investments.

Technical Measures

On the technical side, the noise reduction measures focus on two pillars: vehicle-related
measures and infrastructure-related measures.

There are several vehicle-related measures:

LL-blocks: One of the main sources of railway noise is freight wagons, particularly those
with cast-iron tread-brake blocks. The cast-iron blocks damage the running surface of the
wheels, making the surface rough and increasing the noise level at the wheel-rail interface.
High-speed trains and passenger trains use disc brakes rather than tread brakes; new
vehicles can be fitted with composite tread brake blocks (K-blocks), but these are not
suitable for retrofitting. There are still about 370,000 freight wagons with cast iron brakes
which are worth being retrofitted in Europe, and finding a cost-effective composite brake
block replacement (LL-blocks) for retrofitting is a priority for many railway operators. The
current estimate for retrofitting the 370,000 freight wagons is between 2.2 and 4.2 billion
Euros, but the impact of LL-blocks on wheelset maintenance costs is yet to be established.

Noise can also be a problem on railways with no freight traffic, so other vehicle-related
measures are important:

     x   Wheel absorbers are used to reduce rolling noise and can be effective against
         curve squeal. A range of wheel noise absorption technologies and products have
         been developed. The interaction of wheel noise absorbers and any track noise
         absorbers needs to be considered for optimum system performance.

    x   A number of modified wheels have been developed in recent years but the
        accident with an ICE in Eschede in 1998 has left the industry wary of modified
        wheels for high-speed trains. However, these developments have had significant
        noise reduction potential and it is worth continuing research in this area.

    x   Vehicle-mounted top-of-rail friction modifiers (TOR FM) or flange lubrication
        systems can be used to combat curve squeal (as well as to reduce wear). A range of
        technologies and products are available. These are appropriate for closed systems
        where the vehicles are regularly monitored and maintained, such as local commuter
        networks; urban systems also have tighter curves and consequently more problems
        with curve squeal.

    x   Pantograph noise is a problem with high-speed electric trains, particularly since the
        pantograph is usually higher than noise barriers, if present. Aerodynamic designs
        like shielding or special materials like porous coating of pantographs can be used
        to reduce aerodynamic noise.

Additionally, new rolling stock, introduced since the year 2000, already have lower noise
emissions by 10 dB(A) in comparison with equipment produced in the 1960s and 1970s.
This shows the importance of replacing old rolling stock as soon as possible.

The effectiveness of vehicle-related measures has the best cost-benefit ratio. So
the introduction of composite brakes on freight wagons should be approached
with the highest priority. Other measures can be done complementarily.

A wide variety of infrastructure-related technologies have been developed to combat
noise and vibration. Mostly these fall into three categories:

    x   Noise barriers and bunds are usually large earth mounds creating an artificial cutting
        for the railway; these require several metres of land to the side of the railway which
        is not normally an option for existing railways or urban environments. Noise
        barriers, on the other hand, are suitable for existing railways and urban
        environments, but to be effective they need to be at least two metres high. Noise
        barriers have a poor visual impact, especially since they are a target for graffiti;
        they create problems for track access and incur a high on-going maintenance cost.
        Special acoustic enclosures are sometimes used to surround the railway above as
        well as at the sides.

    x   Track-side lubricators are a traditional method of reducing curve squeal (as well as
        reducing wear) and friction modifiers are used also to reduce brake squeal (in
        shunting yards, for example). Top-of-rail friction modifiers (TOR FM) are also
        effective at reducing corrugation (a major noise source) on the low rail in curves.

    x   Resilient track forms and technologies include: floating slab track, ballast mats,
        resilient base plates, rail pads of various stiffnesses, rail clips that clamp the web
        under the railhead, tuned rail dampers, and booted sleepers. Tunnels under urban
        environments, such as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and Crossrail in London, are
        targets for such technologies. (As noted earlier, the interaction of wheel noise
        absorbers and track noise absorbers needs to be considered for optimum system
        performance.)

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

Additional considerations:

     x    Wheels and rails need to be monitored so that (a) out-of-round wheels (and
          especially wheels with flats) can be turned, and (b) corrugated rails can be ground.
          Out-of-round wheels and corrugated rails are a source of increased rail noise, as
          well as a cause of increased wheel-rail forces and consequent damage.

     x    Track geometry and substructure should be designed and maintained to avoid
          sudden changes in direction or stiffness, both of which increase noise emission,
          wheel-rail forces and consequent damage.

     x    Rail joints should be avoided (insulated rail joints are an exception) and
          continuously welded rail used instead; expansion joints should be scarfed.

Large infrastructure-related investments have already been made in several countries,
including Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, France,
Switzerland, Austria, Italy and Portugal. These measures are necessary, particularly in
densely populated areas. Noise-reducing infrastructure-related measures are usually
introduced with new construction or major redevelopment of railway links according to new
standards where these measures are a requirement, whereas for the existing infrastructure
there is no obligation to lower noise.

Intelligent combinations of vehicle- and infrastructure-related measures help to bring rail
noise down to long-term sustainability levels for a reasonable cost. The analyses of this
study show that infrastructure-related measures can be reduced if effective vehicle-related
measures are also taken. Therefore, a fast retrofit of the existing freight wagon fleet is the
most urgent action to be taken.

Regulation and economic incentive schemes

International examples such as the Japanese top-runner scheme37 underline that a sound
regulation scheme is the heart of any successful pollution reduction strategy. This holds
in particular for noise, because an effective reduction of noise through vehicle-related
measures presupposes that almost all internationally operating rail wagons are equipped
with low-noise technology.

The TSI Noise is an appropriate basis for noise regulation in the medium and long term.
Presently, the standards for noise emissions are valid for new or modified vehicles only. In
the medium and long-term view the TSI can become compulsory for all vehicles. The time
schedule for validation of the noise levels for all vehicles should be long enough to allow for
an adjustment of technology without major additional investment costs. We propose a time
period of 10–12 years, which covers 1–2 revision cycles and is half of the normal life time
of rolling stock (a quarter for freight wagons). The noise levels in TSI Noise should also be
lowered from time to time according to technical development.

Economic incentive schemes consist of charging and bonus/penalty systems. Rail track
charging is an important element of an incentive-compatible penetration strategy for low-
noise rail technology. The principles and request for introducing noise emissions into the
track access charging system are formulated in the Recast of the First Railway Package
(proposed in 2010) and can be implemented by the Member States as the revision of

37
     This scheme aims at reducing energy consumption and climate impact by dynamic setting of emission targets
     on the basis of current best practice (“top runners’ performance”).

Directive 2006/38/EC (Eurovignette) has been adopted on 27 September 2011 (see [Dir.
2011/76/EU]) as the existing Directive 2001//14/EC already allows NDTAC if the same is
allowed for other transportation means. The Directive 2011/76/EU allows for mark-ups
reflecting environmental costs (including noise) for HGVs on motorways and highways. This
means that in the future a balance can be found between road and rail pricing for noise
emissions which does not disturb competition between the transport modes. It is important
to take into consideration that a substantial noise reduction requires that a large proportion
of rail cars are equipped with modern technology. This suggests that lower tariffs should be
offered only to trains which consist entirely of noise-reduced cars. Such a system can be
implemented without installing further electronic devices in the rail cars, if an effective
reporting system is established. The example of the proposed German rail track charging
and retrofit-funding scheme shows that this requirement can be fulfilled. This underlines
that the transaction cost of a noise-differentiated charging system can be held low, which is
an important argument, because many objections against the introduction of such systems
are based on the presumed high transaction costs.

Further alternative or complementary incentives can be introduced through bonus/penalty
systems. In particular, in the transitory phase, bonus payments can motivate the rail car
operators to switch to new technology as early as possible. The railway companies will call
for wide use of this instrument if the state pays for the bonus. From the viewpoint of
setting incentives right, at least a part of financial contributions should be covered by the
rail car owners/operators.

Funding schemes

After assessing the best combinations of technical and economic measures, the financial
implications have to be considered and the impacts on stakeholders have to be analysed. In
our view, the adjustment of braking systems is the most urgent and promising strategy,
complemented by infrastructure-related measures at noise hot-spots. There are different
funding sources, which have to be developed for these measures.

Infrastructure-related measures are financed by the state and/or the rail infrastructure
managers. In the latter case, the additional costs for the infrastructure managers are
passed on to the railway undertakings through the rail track charges. This implies that the
state will have to cover a substantial part of the infrastructure-related costs if the
competitive balance between road and rail is not to be affected. 38

Vehicle-related measures have to be financed by the car owners/operators in the long
term. In the short and medium term, subsidies by the state or the European Union, for
instance bonus payments for retrofitting, can accelerate the change of technology. Member
States will have to decide on the magnitudes of bonus payments and the method of
refinancing. In this context it is crucially important that the territoriality principle will be
fully applied with the rail track charging system, which means that retrofitted rail cars get a
lower tariff regardless of which country they have been licensed in and where the
owner/operator is located.

The vehicle-related funding scheme should be a limited programme for some years (e.g.,
10 years) and should focus on retrofitting existing vehicles. Existing low-noise vehicles can
also be included if the cost of the noise-reduction measure can be verified (former


38
     Note that the mark-ups for noise, as suggested by the Commission, are rather low for HGVs on motorways and
     freeways and the Member States are not obliged to implement them.

retrofitting without funding of the measure, price differences between normal and low noise
vehicle of the same type).

Funding and regulation schemes should be harmonised in the EU to minimise distortions of
competition as many freight transport companies are operating internationally, carrying a
high share of freight rail cars cross-border. “Noise leakages” should be avoided, which
could occur if noisy freight cars, registered in a “low noise cost” country, are operating in
“high noise cost” countries. Therefore a common regulation scheme is necessary,
accompanied by a widely harmonised system of pricing and funding. Variations from this
general rule could only be accepted to the positive side, i.e., to motivate top runners to
start early with appropriate actions. In this context, the trade-off between low noise policy
and competition policy could be more balanced in favour of low noise in the medium-term.
The reason is that rail freight as a whole may lose market share in the medium term if the
noise problems cannot be solved appropriately, and the resistance of the affected
population might impede full capacity utilisation and the removal of capacity bottlenecks.



6.2.       Recommendations for parliamentarian activities

To support and accelerate the introduction of noise reduction measures, the European
Parliament could – in the second reading of the Recast of First Railway Package – only
accept the Recast if the following issues are fulfilled:

   x   Including an obligation for a harmonisation of charging of railway noise in all
       Member States within a reasonable short time period.

   x   Integrate the dependence of the introduction of Noise Depending Track Access
       Charges (NDTAC) from the same introduction in road transport.

   x   Including an obligation to create “Noise Depending Track Access Charges (NDTAC)”
       for the introduction and use of noise reducing measures in each Member State
       according to the levels in TSI Noise (COMM. DEC. 2011/229/EU).

          o   The NDTAC could include funding / covering of higher operational costs if the
              noise reduction measure causes extra costs.
          o   The NDTAC could also include a significant special bonus for trains which are
              completely equipped with noise reduction measures (in addition to funding of
              individual equipment of single rolling stock units).

   x   Including an obligation for the infrastructure managers to maintain the
       infrastructure in a way to avoid noise caused by poor infrastructure conditions (rail
       roughness).

Additional to this, the European Parliament could request the European Commission:

   x   Creates an European Funding Scheme for vehicle-related noise-reduction measures,
       and to motivate Member States to introduce noise-reduction funding for
       internationally operating rolling stock.

   x   Modifies the latest TSI Noise, introduced with Commission Decision (2011/229/EC)
       of 4 April 2011, so that the maximum noise levels are also obligatory for existing
       rolling stock about 10–12 years after introduction of the modification of TSI Noise.

    x   Lowers the maximum noise levels introduced by TSI Noise in a staged process for
        the long-term future, with adjusted obligations for new and existing rolling stock
        (top runner scheme).

To harmonise the competitiveness between rail and road sectors, the European Parliament
could request the European Commission:

    x   Prepares a Directive for a network-wide regulation and charging of lorry noise, at
        least for the TEN-T roads (comprehensive network) – eventually embedded in a
        concept of full internalisation of external costs under explicit consideration of noise-
        reduction targets, extending the optional noise-related motorway charging as in
        Directive 2011/76/EU.

To lower noise at hot spots which cannot be solved by the introduction of vehicle-related
measures, the European Parliament could:

    x   Observe the introduction and fulfilment of noise action plans concerning hot spots in
        rail and road sectors.

    x   Include noise-reduction measures at noise hot spots of the TEN-T (comprehensive
        network including existing links and nodes) into the EU funding facilities (in
        particular the Connecting Europe Facility).

CDC claims 80,000 flu deaths, NCHS says 2,000

    In a recent interview with the Associated Press Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield predictably said, "I'd like to see more
 people vaccinated," but added that in last year's season, "We lost 80,000 people to
 the flu." But there is utterly no data or evidence to back up Redfield's claim of that
extraordinarily high number of deaths from flu. We would like to ask Dr. Redfield to please
share the data that supports his claim.
     According to the National Center for Health Statistics there is usually somewhere
between 1,000 to 2,000 deaths from lab-verified flu annually in the US. Even though the
number of flu shots given in the US increased 800% since the 1980s the number of verified
deaths never seems to budge.
    The flu shot is notoriously ineffective, according to an meta-analysis by the Cochrane
Collaboration typically 71 flu shots need to be administered to prevent one case of the flu.
       There are significant associations between flu shots and autism.
    A recent study showed flu shots given to pregnant women in the first trimester
of pregnancy are associated with a significant increase in autism in the child, but
obstetricians still give flu shots to pregnant women in the first trimester.
    About 20% of flu shots in the US still contain thimerosal, a mercury-based
 preservative. Internal CDC studies performed by Thomas Verstraeten in the late
90s showed 700% more autism in children given thimerosal-containing vaccines
in infancy (google Simpsonwood), but pediatricians still give thimerosal-containing flu shots
to infants. Thimerosal is banned in most of the developed democracies but not here. Any flu
shot taken from a multi-dose vial, rather than a pre-filled syringe, contains thimerosal.

    Three significant studies—two of which were U.S. government funded (NIH)--have been
published today linking fluoride exposure to ADHD, thyroid problems, and showing that
pregnant women in “optimally” fluoridated Canada have significantly higher levels of
fluoride in their urine than women in non-fluoridated communities.
   This third study also showed that pregnant Canadians had fluoride urinary levels similar
to those that reduced IQ in offspring from last year’s Bashash et al, 2017 NIH-funded
study. These findings suggest that the Bashash results from Mexico City may be
applied to Canada, and probably the United States, namely that pre-natal exposure to
fluoride has the potential to lower IQ in children. In other words, the claim by the ADA that
the 2017 Bashash study was not relevant to the U.S. is more about propaganda than
serious scientific analysis.

Here are the three new studies:
--Prenatal fluoride exposure and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in
children at 6–12 years of age in Mexico City.
--Fluoride exposure and thyroid function among adults living in Canada: Effect modification
by iodine status.
--Community Water Fluoridation and Urinary Fluoride Concentrations in a National Sample of
Pregnant Women in Canada.
Below is an article that appeared this morning in Environmental Health News.

We add it to tap water for teeth, but is fluoride hurting
us?
   By Brian Bienkowski, Environmental Health News, Oct. 10, 2018
   Two studies — one from Canada and one Mexico — released today point to potential
health problems from fluoride, which, in a majority of U.S. communities, is purposefully
added to drinking water to protect people's teeth.
   The Canada study found that adults who are iodine deficient and have higher levels of
fluoride in their system have a greater risk of an underactive thyroid. The Mexico study
found mothers with higher fluoride exposure during pregnancy were more likely to have
children with symptoms of ADHD. Both studies were published in the
journal Environmental International.
   A third study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, found that among 1,566
pregnant women in Canada, fluoride levels in urine were almost two times higher for
women who lived in regions where the element was added to their drinking water compared
to pregnant women in regions with non-fluoridated water.
   The studies call into question the practice of purposely adding fluoride to water or salt,
which is done to prevent cavities and, to a lesser extent, osteoporosis. Many cities in the
U.S. and Canada add fluoride to public drinking water and in Mexico it's added to some
salt.
   Approximately 66 percent of people in the U.S. receive drinking water with added
fluoride, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
   About 80 percent of fluoride exposure comes from water and beverages such as tea,
which can leach fluoride from soil. Other sources include grapes and shellfish. . . . .

....this article is very lengthy. It explores iodine deficiency and thyroid problems.

To whom it may concern:
I understand that your municipality has banned the use of leaf blowers
(https://hdsupplysolutions.com/shop/static--leaf_blower_noise_regulation). I am interested in
getting my town, Winchester, MA, to also ban leaf blowers. I mainly object to the air pollution they
generate and its health consequences, though I also resent the noise and recognize they present other
harms. I am writing to request any information you can provide regarding your experience in
enacting the ban, including the actual legislation text, citizens' response to the ban, the basis for your
ban, and the response of landscaping companies and other users to the ban, both before and after the
ban was enacted.
Legislation that I envision includes a combination of a phase-out period during which licenses must
be purchased, eventually culminating in a complete ban, penalties violating the rules, citizen
documentation/reporting/enforcement, and possibly a buy-back program for individual users as an
incentive to stop use very soon. I am curious whether you have found that rakes suffice as a
substitute. I greatly appreciate any help you can provide. Thank you for considering my request.
(I recommend banning vehicle curbside engine idling, as well, if you have not looked into that. Some
states/localities have rules but these are rarely if ever enforced, to everyone's detriment.)
Sincerely,
Lawrence Frank
Winchester, MA
