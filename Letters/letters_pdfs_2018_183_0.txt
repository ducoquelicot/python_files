            List relevant education, training, experience, certificates of training, licenses, or professional
            registration:

            I have a wide range of experience and training that I feel would make me very useful in the role.
            Here is a brief synopsis of pertinent leadership experiences:

                 1. I have been able to successfully lead the University A.M.E. Zion through a significant
                    transformation and growth. When I arrived five years ago, our congregation was down
                    to 19 active members, who were black and seniors. Today we have grown to 120 active
                    members, and we are now a multicultural church with an average age of 32.
                 2. I have completed the required course of study and educational training necessary for
                    the ordination in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The ordination criteria
                    are eight years of denominational study and formal schooling. This training included
                    focus on community building, interpersonal conflict resolution and more.
                 3. I work on the national level to address systemic societal issues. I am currently part of the
                    leadership cadre for the March Against Racism in Washington DC on April 4 th in
                    Washington DC to commemorate the 50 th anniversary of the assassination of Martin
                    Luther King. This march is sponsored by the National Council of Churches which
                    represents 38 denominations, 100,000 congregations, and 45 million people.
                 4. I have been selected to be part of the Next Generation Leadership Cohort of World
                    Methodist Evangelism which is part of World Methodist Council which represent 82
                    million people from 133 countries.
                 5. I am part of the Emerging Social Leader Cohort of the Peninsula Solidarity Network. I am
                    the only clergy selected to the cohort from Santa Clara County.
                 6. I served as the Vice Chairperson for Ecumenical Hunger Program in East Palo Alto.


            Describe your involvement in community activities, volunteer and civic organizations:

            I am currently the Senior Pastor of the University A.M.E. Zion Church which is the oldest black
            church in the city of Palo Alto; this role has allowed me to connect with a wide range of
            community leaders and to be on the forefront of community dialogue around many issues. In
            the past three years I have led or participated in several initiatives to help foster a healthy
            conversation in our community:

            Community Open Forums on Race in America: After the tragic shootings at Mother Emmanuel
            A.M.E. Church in Charleston SC, there was a significant community outpouring of concern about
            race and where do we move from here. We held several community forums, which each had
            over 150 people in attendance. These forums allowed us to start the discussion around race
            and equality in our community and our country as a whole. Out of these community forums, we
            executed three significant initiatives; the first was the Community Unity Fair at Cubberley
            Community Center. We partnered with the city of Palo Alto and several local religious and civic
            organizations to hold a community fair that had children of different racial, ethnic, and religious
            backgrounds coming together to have fun. The goal was to create a space that would allow
DocuSign Envelope ID: C4619C96-457B-4723-B7BF-F4E706BFF269




            children meet others from different backgrounds and let them see that we are all the same. The
            second was viewing and discussing the movie
            Church. This movie dealt with white privilege and its impact on racism and implicit bias and how
            it impacts Palo Alto. The discussion was lively and cathartic. The third activity was a community
            book club that read the book "The New Jim Crow." It was a thought­provoking and compelling
            dialogue dealing with mass incarceration and how it impacts our communities.

            I have also partnered with the Human Relations Committee in the planning of two initiatives in
            2016 and 2017 named "Being Different Together." The original
            2016 was a panel discussion and forum held at the Mitchell Park Library. I was part of the
            planning team along with being the moderator for that event. This event was a great success
            and well attended; it sparked us to ask the question, How could we continue the positive
            momentum and equip community leaders with tools to address implicit bias In 2017 we
            planned a 4 part                         Being Different Together." We worked with Dr. Joseph
            Brown from Stanford University to bring the implicit bias training that Stanford developed to
            the Palo Alto community. We were intentional inviting and encouraged persons from varied
            perspectives to be part of this community dialogue. It was terrific to have so many different
            views in the room. It made the discussion more meaningful and authentic. This initiative was a
            great success because of the positive community response. It also allowed people to be
            reflective of their implicit bias and it equipped them with tools to take back to their various
            constituency.

            I have also been active in promoting and developing ecumenical and interfaith connections in
            Palo Alto. Under my leadership, the University A.M.E. Zion Church has led our community in
            several activities to encourage religious tolerance. One of our events was sponsoring the 2016
            Multifaith Peace Walk and Picnic to remember 9/11. The Multifaith Peace Walk started at
            Congregation Etz Chayim/Spark Church, then it went to University Church, followed by walking
            to Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church and concluded with American Muslim Voice hosted
            Peace Picnic at Mitchell Park. Each of the stops put together a brief presentation on how we
            can achieve peace in our society. The march was a fantastic show of solidarity in our community
            with over 700 participants, and over 35 community faith and civic organization represented
            including the Chief of Police from the city of Palo Alto.

            Finally, I am part of the of the Social Justice for Emerging Leader cohort for the Peninsula
            Solidarity Network. The Silicon Valley Foundation sponsors the Social Justice for Emerging
            Leader cohort. This program gathers community leaders from many faith traditions to research,
            discuss and dialogue with subject matter experts on issues that specifically affect our area. We
            have spent significant time examining issues such immigration, hyper­capitalism, and housing
            issues.

            1. What is it about the Human Relations Commission that is compatible with your experience
            and of specific interest to you, and why?

            Building healthy and sustainable communities is one of my passions. Whether it is in my role as
            Senior Pastor at University or in the Palo Alto community, I desire to build bridges and give
            voice to all stakeholders, equitably and efficiently. I believe this lines up with the stated
            purpose of the Human Relations Commission of fostering public awareness and understanding
            of human relations by any means. I believe the first step in any movement forward or
            reconciliation is an open dialogue, and it hopefully will foster compassion and communication
            for all parties involved.

            We live in very complicated times, and I believe for Palo Alto to continue to be a healthy and
            dynamic city, the work of the Human Relations Commission is vital. People in the community
            need to know there is a place where they can speak on complicated and nuanced issues we
            face today.

            2. Please describe an issue that recently came before the Commission that is of particular
            interest to you and describe why you are interested in it. If you have never been to a
            Commission meeting you can view an archive:

            The March 8th meeting of the Human Relations Commission dealt with the issue of Palo Alto
            Police Field Based Video Policy. I believe this is one of the most critical issues in modern
            policing. The use of these technologies adds a layer of accountability and protection to the
            police officers. It's important that our city has a comprehensive policy in place to protect its
            citizens and employees. In today's modern political climate policing incidents can be significant
            flashpoints and having video evidence can hopefully allow for more clarity in the investigation
            of these incidents.

            3. If appointed, what specific goals would you like to see the Human Relations Commission
            achieve, and why? How would you suggest accomplishing this?

            Palo Alto is indeed a global city, attracting people from all over the world. Our diversity is one
            of our greatest strengths, but it is an underutilized resource. Many people in Palo Alto have
            limited community based around work, ethnic groups or children activities. We as a city need to
            find ways to encourage and build deeper relationships based on the fact that we are all Palo
            Alto residents. We need to find ways to help those who are new to the community to dive into
            the deep end and connect with others. We also need to find ways to encourage longtime
            residents to be more receptive and accepting of newcomers. If I have the honor of being on the
            Human Relations Commission, my goal would be to develop resolutions, events, programs, and
            initiatives to encourage broader community in the city we call home.
