Subject:               10/29 Council Agenda Questions for Item 4




 Dear Mayor and Council Members:

 On behalf of City Manager Jim Keene, please find below in bold staff responses to inquiries
 made by Council Member Tanaka in regard to the October 29, 2018 council meeting agenda.

 Item 4: Approval of Fiscal Year 2018 Reappropriation Requests and Budget Amendments –
 CM Tanaka


 Item 4: Approval of Fiscal Year 2018 Reappropriation Requests and Budget Amendments –
 CM Tanaka

           Q. 1. The format of Attachment B is not as useful as the format of Attachment A. The
           fact that there were inaccuracies in each project’s management relative to revenue
           and expenditures is understandable. Attachment A’s format provides the reasons for
           the proposed budget changes. One problem with Attachment A’s format is that the
           original appropriation is in the description field (mostly), rather than in its own
           column. Having these two numbers clearly visible offers one the opportunity to see
           the percentage of error/change that was in the previous budget. If there is a project
           tracking number for the projects in Attachment A—it is missing.

           Can you please provide an explanation?

           A. 1. The format of Attachment B and Attachment A differ since Attachment A is
           focused on Operating Budget Reappropriations while Attachment B focuses on
           Capital Budget Reappropriations. Project Numbers are not used in the Operating
           Budget, so they are not included in Attachment A. The explanations for Capital
           Reappropriations are not as varied as the explanations for Operating
           Reappropriations so they are explained in the body of the report rather than with
           each individual line item. This can be found on page 4 of the staff report. Regardless
           of the recommended adjustment, it does not change the overall budget for the
           Capital project; instead it shifts the project budget between fiscal years.

           Q. 2. Why didn’t the City receive $10.5 million of revenue from the Dewatering and
           Loadout Facility in the last fiscal year? Why is it expected this fiscal year?


                                                              1
        A. 2. The revenue and expense for the Dewatering and Loadout Facility were both
        originally budgeted in FY 2018. However, the State Revolving Loan Funding is
        disbursed to the City as the work on this project is completed, on a reimbursement
        basis. As such, the shift of the revenue from FY 2018 to FY 2019 brings the budget
        in line with the anticipated completion of the project. The project was
        approximately half‐way done at the end of FY 2018 and approximately half of the
        revenue was collected. Reappropriating the remaining revenue ensures appropriate
        alignment between the FY 2019 budget and the project completion to offset the
        remaining construction costs. A matching expense reappropriation was not done
        for this project because the funds were already obligated to the contract and are
        thereby included in the budget.




Thank you,

Re: Appeal to uphold the privacy for our Eichler home

Hello dear council members,
Our appeal case has reached the consent calendar and will be reviewed by you and the city council
members on Monday 10/29/2018 (tomorrow evening).
Appeal filing: App # 8
File # 17PLN-00272
(ID # 9671)
Our neighbor, Tim Perkins and we (my wife Jasleen and I) are not averse to the construction of the 2nd
level by the owners at 3743 Redwood Circle. However, we have repeatedly requested the city planning
department (Amy French and Graham Owen) that the 3743 Redwood Circle plans be revised so as to not
breach our privacy and to ensure that we can continue to maintain the quality of life that we have
enjoyed in our beautiful Eichler community and neighborhood.
We cherish the inside-out and outside-in Eichler living style!
After multiple reviews and discussions, following are the key outstanding items that we request the
council members to earnestly consider towards safe-guarding the privacy of our home along with the
privacy needs of Tim Perkins and his immediate neighbor to the right (Andrea) who has two small
children.
    1. Provide a 40 foot setback instead of the current proposed ~29 feet.
            a. The 2-story home on the right side of 3743 (Burt at 3747 Redwood Circle) has a 40 feet
               set-back and was built more than 21 years back. Our request and acceptable
               compromise is that the 2nd level setback for 3743 Redwood Circle also needs to be at
               40 feet just like that of Burt’s home.
    2. Center the 2nd floor volume.
            a. We are unable to reconcile that the ne proposed 2nd level volume (mass) placement is
               mainly on one side – that is, the majority area of the new 2nd level construction will face
               our backyard and adversely impact our privacy. With the current proposed plans, our
               home (3714 Carlson Circle) takes the biggest brunt of this new construction.
    3. Provide the main windows on the front-face of the 2nd level so it faces the street.
            a. Multiple homes on Carlson Circle with a 2nd level including our own (3714 Carlson
               Circle), have a similar plan where the main windows are facing the street – which allows
               good light and air flow in the home without encroaching the privacy of neighbors.
    4. Have additional egress windows to the side walls with no egress windows on the back-wall
            a. We believe by centering the 2nd level volume, the ‘glazed’ egress windows can be on
               the sides (left and right vs. the back) of the home. This allows better distance from the
               side neighbors versus having the volume of the 2nd level on any one side.
Being in an Eichler community the back-wall of our house opens into the back-yard and is a series of full
length sliding glass doors. This is our outside-in and inside-out experience that Eichlers are so well
known for. The council and city development office need to consider and uphold the experience and
privacy requirements in such classic neighborhoods and communities.
The Eichler guidelines recommend that owners ‘must’ plant trees in order to block someone from
peeping into our homes from their 2nd level which is constructed very close to our backyards. For new
construction, such guidelines are un-reasonable because it burdens us with the responsibility to check
and file complaints to the city against our neighbors if the trees are short, die or get bare due to some
sickness. We can avoid such hardship and long term angst by requiring the new construction of the 2nd
level to have at least 40 feet setbacks.
We hope the city planning and development office uses our recommendations as a ‘model’ for updating
the Eichler guidelines including the Individual Review guidelines to keep privacy as the primary focus.
We are interested to maintain harmony and respect among neighbors and, mutual privacy is a key
catalyst for a peaceful neighborhood and longer term thriving community. Please help mitigate a
situation where are privacy is encroached by the building plans as proposed by 3743 Redwood Circle.

Attached are some pictures where you will see first-hand how couple other properties that face our
back-yards breach our privacy currently by having full view into our homes. We are earnestly trying to
stop this from happening again and would really appreciate your consideration.

Looking forward to saying hello to each of you in person.

Warm regards,

Jasleen and Manoj Raisinghani

Dear Council Members,
I’m writing in support of Manoj and Jasleen Raisinghani’s appeal filing, App # 8 File # 17PLN‐00272 (ID #9671),
concerning the privacy of their home at 3714 Carlson Circle.

Maintaining personal privacy in our unique Eichler neighborhoods presents unique challenges that will sometimes
require careful application of planning regulations and voluntary guidelines. This is such a situation.

The Raisinghanis are asking that reasonable considerations be applied to the proposed construction at 3743 Redwood
Circle, they have gone through the proper channels of our City’s planning department and discussed the situation with
several Council members, and it seems to many of us who live in our Eichler neighborhoods that it is imperative that the
City back up its commitment to the new Eichler guidelines with appropriate supportive action.

I urge you to support the Raisinghanis, and by extension, all our Eichler neighborhoods, in their efforts to protect their
privacy and maintain their quality of life.

Sincerely,
‐‐Len

October 29, 2018

Dear Palo Alto City Council Members,

I’m writing in support of Manoj and Jasleen Raisinghani’s appeal filing,
App # 8 File # 17PLN-00272 (ID #9671), concerning the proposed building
plans which impacts the privacy of their home at 3714 Carlson Circle. I
would speak to the council in person if I did not have a medical
appointment conflict.c

In my letters to the planning department regarding this project, the last
of which was attached to your council package, I identified privacy as a
significant Eichler issue given the unique neighborhood layout and the
typical large glass exposures in the side and back yards. Having personal
experience living adjacent to a two story house, I know first hand the
loss of privacy and the resultant vulnerability and sense of violation.

Maintaining personal privacy in the Fairmeadow Neighborhood Association
"Circles' is a unique challenge but the concept can be extrapolated to
other Eichler neighborhoods. The Eichler guidelines were a significant
step towards addressing Eichler owner and resident concerns, but I do
believe additional refinements, perhaps coming from the dialog about 3743
Redwood Circle would add value to the document in its next iteration. Many
of us who live in Eichler neighborhoods believe it is important the City
listen to the intent of the Eichler Guidelines in addition to meeting the
letter of the 'law'.

I urge you to support the Raisinghanis by removing the item from the
consent calendar. Your actions will communicate to all Eichler owners and
residents that you remain concerned about protecting their privacy and
maintaining their quality of life, and that the issue is complex and
merits further reflection and discussion.

Sincerely,

Tim Perkins

Dear Palo Alto City Council Members,

I am writing in support of Manoj and Jasleen Raisinghani's appeal filling, App # 8 File # 17‐PLN‐00272 (ID #9671),
concerning the proposed building plans which impacts the privacy of their home at 3714 Carlson Circle.

I have sent previous letters regarding remodel/tear down projects in and around our Circle. Privacy has been raised as a
significant issue facing any project involving an Eichler neighborhood like we have in the Fairmeadow tract. The Eichler
guidelines are a step in the right direction. The project that I am referencing in this email can also lead to productive
dialog on additional steps to ensure that a harmonious solution is found so that neighbors like the Raisinghani's can
enjoy their backyard and living area exposed to their backyard without feeling like they are living in a fishbowl. They
have made some slight, but significant requests to this project that would be a a great step to protecting privacy not just
for them, but for any home owner in a Palo Alto Eichler neighborhood concerned about site lines and privacy.

I urge you to support the Raisinghani's by removing the item from the consent calendar. This action will help reiterate
that the privacy and site line issue facing all Eichler neighborhoods outside of Green Meadow is complex and merits
further discussion.

Sincerely,

Elected Council Members:

An article in the Post suggests that the City Manager is promoting a six‐months "study" to determine what, if anything,
can be downsized in order to determine how much money might be free to pay CalPERS contributes at a lower discount
rate than suggested by CalPERS.

Attached please find a spreadsheet that the City developed for a Council off‐site some years ago to provide the Council
insight into what the City was doing with the taxpayers money. While the data in the spreadsheet is dated, the point of
passing this along to you is to suggest that this sort of exercise has been conducted in the past and didn't take six‐
months, or more to complete.

It's not suggested that this format needs to be followed, but certainly identifying where the money goes in terms of
services and customers and organizing that data is something that every organization would want to do periodically.

1   Do not over write formula in columns D, F, and H.

    Data is added to these fields by entering a appropriate code
2   from either the Program-Tier or Dept table.


3   First enter your appropriate department code into cell E2

    Example: If your are in CSD your code is 6. If you enter "6"
    into cell E2, CSD will appear in cell F2.

    To start entering your departmental data, tab to cell B7.
    Using the Program-Tier Table select the appropriate code
4   for the program/function you are describing.

    Example: If your are in Police and you are preparing the
    service level justification for Patrol, you would determine
    that the Program-Tier Type description that best describes
    the Patrol function is:

    A = Essential Service/Health & Safety/Legal Mandate


    You would then enter A into cell B7. Cells D7 and F7 would
    the automatically populate with the information. This may
    seem like a lot a trouble to simply fill in these small fields,
    but it will be much more consistent in the end.

    Next, in cell G7 enter the corresponding code for your
5   department from the dept table.


    Now you can begin entering the data for your department, if

Subject:          retirement costs and budget item tonight


I support the careful attention asked for with regard to retirement cost funding and the entire budget
process.

I have been asked by staff to review the long-range revenue forecast but have not started that review and
these comments are separate from that.

The September UCLA forecast shares short term cautions that I find convincing.

The nation faces lower labor force growth, rising trade deficits, rising budget deficits and rising interest
rates through at least 2021 and probably beyond. While the local economy may do somewhat better than
the nation or state in terms of growth, we will be affected by these trends.

So the next two years -- mid 2019 to mid 2021 --will be tough fiscal years even without the retirement
cost challenges.

I applaud lowering the implied rate of return below the CalPers target and would consider running some
numbers also with a 5.5% rate of return assumption.

There are other factors that suggestion some near term caution but for now, thanks for taking this budget
round seriously toward the goal of long-term fiscal and retirement cost stability. It is always better
financially to make adjustments earlier rather than delay though they may not be popular with residents.

Subject:             Revisions to Council's Policies and Procedures


Dear Mayor Kniss and Council members,

I cannot speak at tonight’s meeting, so I am sending this material in writing.

1. Current Council Policy and Procedures (page 44) states:

      Respect for Process
      Members shall perform their duties in accordance with the processes and rules of
      order established by the City Council governing the deliberation of public policy
      issues, meaningful involvement of the public and implementation of policy
      decisions of the City Council by City staff.

Meaningful involvement of the public is not possible when members of the public are given only one minute to speak to
an item. At a minimum, two minutes should be given to each member of the public, and preferably three minutes
except in unusual circumstances. A large number of speakers is not an unusual circumstance that should limit the time
of individual members of the public on a regularly scheduled agenda item.

2. Last minute proposals by staff or Council members should not be considered at the same meeting, but should be
continued to a subsequent meeting where the public has an opportunity to review and comment. Last minute proposals
occurred often in the Comprehensive Plan Update process and also occurred in the Accessory Dwelling Unit zoning
amendments. These did not provide for the “meaningful involvement of the public.”

3. Regarding the Consent Calendar, Council members should be allowed to state the reason for dissent prior to the vote
because the reason might sway other Council members to change their votes. The Brown Act may preclude
communication prior to the Council meeting, so it is imperative that Council members be allowed to explain their votes
prior to the vote occurring. Furthermore, the number of Council members required to remove an item from the
Consent Calendar should be reduced to two along with the reduction in Council size.

4. The election of the Mayor and Vice Mayor must be subject to the Brown Act. This has been an issue identified in
other cities as well.

5. Pursuant to the Roberts Rules of Order, the Mayor should refrain from making or seconding a motion while presiding
over the meeting.

Thank you for your considerations.

Sincerely,
Arthur Keller

sidewalk or other public place, the applicant shall notify the director of public works-city
engineer, and the city engineer, or designee, shall review on behalf of the applicant the utility

                                 Amendment to Council Handbook


       AMENDMENT TO THE CITY COUNCIL PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS HANDBOOK

       In November, 2014, the Charter of the City of Palo Alto was amended by the electorate
to reduce the City Council to seven members (from the current nine member council) effective
January 1, 2019.

        In order to prevent conflicts with the California Brown Act, relevant sections of the Palo
Alto City Council Procedures and Protocols Handbook must also be amended to reflect the
seven-member Council.

       Upon approval by the City Council, the following amendments shall become effective
January 1, 2019:

       Subsection (K) (Council Matters) of Subsection 2.4 (General Requirements) of Section 2
(Council Meeting & Agenda Guidelines) of the City Council Procedures and Protocols Handbook
is hereby amended as follows (deleted text is in stril~ethro1:1gh, new text is underlined):

       K. Council Matters
       Any two Council Members may bring forward a colleague memo on any
       topic to be considered by the entire Council. Two Council Members are
       required to place such a memo on the agenda, reflective of the Council
       procedure requiring a motion and a second for consideration of a motion
       by the Council. Up to~ three Council Members may sign a colleague
       memo. The City Attorney recommends.that the colleague memo be
       limited to #M:ee two Council Members in order to avoid the potential of a
       Brown Act issue. Prior to preparing a colleague memo, Council Members
       will consult with the City Manager to determine whether he/she is or is
       willing and able to address the issues as part of his/her operational
       authority and within current budgeted resources. Colleague's memos
       should have a section that identifies any potential staffing or fiscal
       impacts of the contemplated action. This section will be drafted by the
       City Manager. Council Members shall provide a copy of the proposed
       memo with the City Manager or appropriate senior staff prior to
       finalization. Completed Council colleagues memos shall be provided to
       the City Clerk's staff by noon on the Tuesday prior to the Council meeting
       that the memo is intended to be agendized, to provide time for the City
       Clerk to process for the Council packet.

              The City Council will not take action on the night that a colleague
       memo is introduced if it has any implications for staff resources or
       current work priorities which are not addressed in the memo. The
       Council will discuss the colleague memo and then direct the City Manager
       to agendize the matter for Council action within two meetings, allowing
                                Amendment to Council Handbook

       City staff time to prepare a summary of staffing and resource impacts.
       Action may be taken immediately by the Council on colleague memos
       where there are no resource or staffing implications or where these are
       fully outlined in the colleagues memo. The Brown Act requires that the
       public be fully informed of the potential action by the Council via the
       Agenda 72 hours before a scheduled Council meeting. In order to satisfy
       the Brown Act requirements, the Council should consult with the City
       Attorney to ensure that the proposed title to the colleague memo
       contains all actions that the Council Members want completed on the
       night of the Council review.




           Subsection (3) (Appointment} of Subsection (Y) (Ad Hoc Committees) of Subsection 2.4
(General Requirements) of Section 2 (Council Meeting & Agenda Guidelines) of the City Council
Procedures and Protocols Handbook is hereby amended as follows (deleted text is in
striketl:ire1::1gl:i, new text is underlined):

       3} Appointment
       The Mayor or the City Council may appoint .fet:H: three or less members of
       the Council to serve on an Ad Hoc Committee. In contrast, only the
       Council and not the Mayor alone can create a Standing Committee. The
       Mayor will publicly announce any Ad Hoc Committee created by him or
       her, its membership and stated purpose and posted on the City Council
       website. The City Manager shall prepare a report to Council about the
       anticipated time commitment required for staff to assist the Ad Hoc
       Committee.

Subject:               An important idea regarding the rail grade separation especially regarding the viaduct option


Hi council members and related city departments,

I learnt about the council decision to vote the fate of the viaduct option soon. After serious consideration, I am bringing
up my thought and proposal about it.

While I still feel that the lowering train tracks options are far better for Palo Alto residents, I am proposing an idea about
a modified version of the viaduct option. Have you or the responsible teams study the option of constructing such a kind
of viaduct that holds a pipeline to let the trains run through inside the pipe, which is very much like a "tunnel" over the
viaduct, or we can say it is a viaduct with walls on all sides? The advantage of this proposal is that it does not need to
overcome the technical and environmental difficulties due to the underground water/creek issues that we may face in
the underground tunnel or trench option. Also, it will eliminate the noise, health, safety, privacy issues that are deeply
concerning the railroad neighborhood (including myself). I hope the city can seriously consider about this and add this
into one of the options or transform the viaduct option into something like this.

In regard to the hybrid option that raises the train tracks, that is equally bad or even worse than the original open (as
opposed to having walls) viaduct option, even if not all people realize that yet. The hybrid option also raises the train
wheels higher than the residents' backyard fences, which makes it have almost all the downsides that the viaduct option
has. Moreover, it effectively cuts the Palo Alto east and west into two parts visually. I suggest the city combine the
viaduct option with this hybrid option that raises the train tracks into one vote, because it makes little sense to leave this
option while voting down the viaduct given those reasons.

As a resident, I sincerely wish the city can move forward with an option that benefits the residents overall, but I still hold
the bottom line that the railroad neighborhood residents' health, safety and privacy cannot be sacrificed to achieve any
goal. So, let's work together to work it out.

Thanks,
Linhai

 Hi Cory, Greg, Lydia, Adrian,

 I am a resident living in the Charleston Meadow area with my family. We are very surprised to learn that the options that will raise
 the rails (including MCL) are still on the table, given our community is so against it. Here is why we are so against it. With the
 current height of the train tracks, we can already see through the windows of the caltrains in our backyard and even in the living
 room. We cannot imagine if the train tracks are raised another 14 feet (almost twice as high as our fence). The question now is not
 how it will impact the privacy of the caltrain neighbor residents. From our direct experience (before seeing any 3D simulation), we
 can testify that there will be no privacy at all. Let's forget about the noise (especially the freight trains) for a moment. Just think
 about trains passing over the head every day. Just think about that kind of feeling and how much stress that will cause "every" day.
 People have been so anxious about the decisions on your hands that they cannot even fall asleep sometimes. For us it is not just
 discussion and analysis, it is our life, daily life! We have been keeping mentioning the constraints, but I think no elevation of the
 rails should be the most basic constraint.

                                                                   1
(I agree with one point from one of you that we should factor in the cost of all the necessary mitigation such as insulation, sight
blocking, etc. into the cost analysis, although I also think much of the long‐term damage caused by elevation will be so costly that
can't even be measured.)

Thanks.

             The California High-Speed Rail Authority (Authority) continues its commitment
             to provide updates on the program’s progress in the Northern California
             region. Here’s what’s happened this month.

High-Speed Rail Authority Board of Directors Approve
Alignment within Fresno to Bakersfield Project Section
Certifies Final Supplemental Environmental Impact
Report




The California High-Speed Rail Authority (Authority) Board of Directors on
October 16 certified the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report
(Final Supplemental EIR) for the Fresno to Bakersfield Project Section and
approved a high-speed rail alignment between Poplar Avenue in Kern County
and the F Street station location in downtown Bakersfield. This allows the
Authority to take additional steps toward advancing major work on the
project.

“Today’s decision by the Board of Directors reflects the successful partnership
between the Authority and our regional partners to find a path forward in
bringing high-speed rail to Bakersfield,” said Board Chair Dan Richard. “Having
a high-speed rail station in Bakersfield will spur new economic activities and
development in the region, and tie the Central Valley to Northern and
Southern California like never before.”

The Board of Directors heard a staff presentation and took public comments
on the Fresno to Bakersfield Final Supplemental EIR. After deliberations, the
Board of Directors voted unanimously to certify the document under the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), approve the project and
alignment between Poplar Avenue in Kern County and the F Street station
location in downtown Bakersfield and adopt documents required under CEQA.

Authority Progress Highlighted at National High-Speed
Leadership Summit




Chair Emeritus of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association Rod Diridon presenting the inaugural Governor
Edmund G. Brown Jr. National High-Speed Rail Champion’s Award to CAHSRA Board Chair Dan Richard.


  Representatives from the California High-Speed Rail Authority (Authority)
  were featured prominently in two significant stakeholder events last
  month: the National High-Speed Rail Leadership Summit in San Jose and
  Governor Jerry Brown’s Global Climate Action Summit at the Moscone
  Center in San Francisco.

  The three-day National High-Speed Rail Leadership Summit, held
  September 11-13 at the Santa Clara County Building, featured various high-
  speed and transportation-related discussions and presentations. Authority
  Board Member Bonnie Lowenthal, Northern California Regional Director
  Boris Lipkin, Sustainability Director Meg Cederoth and Board Chair Dan
  Richard all spoke during the summit, which concluded with the Authority
  hosting a tour of construction sites in the Central Valley on September 13.




                                                   3
 On the first day of the summit, Board Chair Richard was presented with the
 inaugural Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. National High-Speed Rail
 Champion’s Award for his role in supporting and advancing the high-speed
 rail program.

 “Of course, receiving this award was a great personal honor, but it really
 represents the incredible progress we as an organization have made in
 building America’s first high-speed rail system,” said Richard, who was
 appointed to Authority Board in August 2011 and subsequently voted Board
 Chair in February 2012. “It’s appropriate that the U.S. High-Speed Rail
 Association named this award after Governor Brown, because without his
 leadership this project would have never gotten off the ground.”

 The week concluded with Authority CEO Brian P. Kelly speaking at the
 Governor’s Global Climate Action Summit, during which Kelly provided an
 update on the Authority’s streamlined land acquisition process and its
 public outreach efforts in the Southern California that is designed to
 update key environmental stakeholders on the program’s progress.

 Said Kelly, “I firmly believe that strengthening these relationships is key to
 building greater understanding of why this project is critical to California’s
 future mobility, economic prosperity and sustainability and climate
 objectives.”




San Francisco Approves Alignment for Downtown
Extension




                                        4
The San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) in September
approved the Pennsylvania Avenue as its preferred tunneling alignment for the
downtown extension (DTX) – an extension that will ultimately bring high-speed
rail and Caltrain service to the Salesforce Transit Center in downtown San
Francisco.

The construction route of the tunnel is expected to cost $6.1 billion and is
scheduled to be ready to provide Caltrain and high-speed rail service by 2027.

The entire Downtown Rail Extension Project includes a 1.3-mile rail line that will
include the creation of a transit-friendly neighborhood, with 3,000 new homes
and mixed-use development. The extension will provide Caltrain and high-speed
rail with a line that will extend from the current Caltrain station at 4th and King
Streets.


Caltrain Begins Tunnel Work to Advance its
Electrification Project

In order to accommodate its new, incoming fleet of electric trains, Caltrain
construction crews launched work in the four San Francisco tunnels, work that is
essential in order to electrify the Caltrain Peninsula Corridor.

In order to facilitate work in the tunnels, trains will not serve the San Francisco
or 22nd Street stations on weekends from October 6, 2018 to late spring 2019.

Crews will create additional clearance in the tunnel sides to accommodate the
new trains and will install anchor bolts in the tunnel ceilings to facilitate the
installation of the overhead contact system that will power the new electric
trains.

High-speed rail continues to make
significant progress in the Central
Valley in constructing the nation’s
first high-speed rail system. In
October’s construction update, we
take a look at the work to extend the
Cedar Viaduct across State Route 99.
Meantime, excavation work continues
under State Route 180 as crews are
preparing to build the passageway for
high-speed trains. Plus, get a look at
the recent concrete pours at the San            Construction Update

San Francisco to San Jose
Project Section
Next Environmental Milestone
The project team continues to advance engineering and environmental analysis
on two alternatives, which will contribute to a staff recommended State’s
Preferred Alternative that will be presented to the Board of Directors in
December 2019. Below is an updated schedule to deliver the Final
Environmental Impact Report/Statement (EIR/EIS) for the San Francisco to San
Jose Project Section, including the State’s Preferred Alternative as the next
environmental milestone.

Community Working Groups Schedule
This month marks the restart of Community Working Groups (CWG). There are
three groups:

      San Francisco CWG
      San Mateo County CWG
      South Peninsula CWG (previously known as the Santa Clara County CWG)

These groups are comprised of representatives from neighborhood associations,
business organizations, and transit advocates throughout the Peninsula Corridor.
All meetings are open to the public.

Materials from these meetings can be found on the Authority’s website, here,
under Community Meetings.




San Jose to Merced Project
Section
Developing a Concept Plan
The Authority along with Partner Agencies, the City of San José, Santa Clara
Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) and Caltrain, entered into a Cooperative
Agreement earlier this year to develop a Concept Plan for the integration
of existing and future transit services at a new, expanded Diridon Station. The
vision is to deliver a world-class transportation hub that provides seamless
customer experience for movement between transit modes within the station
and into the surrounding neighborhoods and downtown San Jose.

Additionally, the Authority continued its engagement with environmental
agencies and non-governmental stakeholders in the Santa Clara Valley and
Pacheco Pass this month. These valuable interactions are establishing a highly
productive collaboration as we consider and effectively plan for all potential
environmental impacts from all of the alternatives under study in the project
section. This work is leading up to the next milestone of the selection of the
State’s Preferred Alternative planned for September of next year.

Subject:           Digital Gap: Poor Use & Rich Ban it in schools




From New York Times
by Nellie Bowles, Oct. 26, 2018


The Digital Gap Between Rich and Poor Kids is Not what
We Expected
      America's public schools are still promoting devices with
   screens--even offering digital-only preschools. The rich are
   banning screens from class altogether.
    But now, as Silicon Valley’s parents increasingly panic over the impact screens have on
their children and move toward screen-free lifestyles, worries over a new digital divide are
rising.
   It could happen that the children of poorer and middle-class parents will be raised
by screens, while the children of Silicon Valley’s elite will be going back to wooden
toys and the luxury of human interaction.

Subject:             Exit from 101N onto Oregon Expressway


Dear City Council members,

The traffic on the 101N on the mile leading up to the Oregon Expressway exit is usually crowded around the evening
rush hour. Sometimes I see cars use the mile‐long exit‐only lane before the Oregon Expressway exit as a way to bypass
the traffic. This is problematic for two reasons:

1) The car that abuses the exit lane needs to slow down and merge back into the traffic‐heavy expressway. The
slowdown can be unexpected and cause accidents, and it blocks the people from actually exiting until the car merges
back in.

2) Everyone else in the freeway is fairly waiting their turn. Seeing a car cut ahead in front of them can provoke
frustration, which may lead to unsafe driving. Sometimes people may beep at the exit lane abuser, which might cause
them to road rage later.

Can we put up signs to say that drivers using the exit lane must exit? This would help alleviate traffic in the exit lane and
allow for safer driving around that intersection. There is an article around this type of policy
here: https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/02/10/exit‐lane‐cheaters‐tempt‐road‐rage‐crashes‐and‐sometimes‐a‐
ticket/

Thank you for your consideration,
Michael

+--------------------------------+------------------------+

Total: $1.1M.

Does anyone on the Council know what these people are doing for this money?

A similar question (or two) might be asked: Does anyone on the Council know how much money is spent on consultants
on a yearly basis? Does the Council require the City Manager to list all of the consultant contracts for the public to
review?

It would seem that there might easily be two million dollars to be found in the area of "management specialists" and
"consultants".

"Pack" sections are either written for morons or written by morons. In fact, on second review, this entire flyer is
ridiculous.

Be mindful that you are addressing Palo Alto, the Stanford community, and the heart of Silicon Valley. We are the richest
little town in America, and a town of billionaires and geniuses. Your flyer is patronizing and just plain stupid. Who the
hell is responsible for such trash? How dare you address my community in such a demeaning way!

You are exploiting hard earned taxpayers' monies. Just knock it off. Whoever you are, you are a leach, and whoever is
responsible for hiring you should be fired. You have thrown away valuable taxpayer monies with expensive and insulting
advertising. Shame on you!!

Please respond. ‐‐I demand to know: how much money was wasted on composing such nonsense, and how much
unnecessary money was dumped into the very expensive PA Weekly's Advertising Department? Who is
responsible? Palo Alto taxpayers want accountability.

Backyard

A home being built in the backyard of another house in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los
Angeles. Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times


Good morning.


What would it take for you to put the homeless in your own backyard?


The city and county of Los Angeles are attempting to find out.


In separate pilot programs, officials are offering subsidies of between $10,000 and
$30,000 to homeowners who commit to creating accessory dwelling units — more
commonly called “granny flats” — and renting them out to the formerly homeless.


On Monday, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced the city won a $1 million grant to
get the experiment off the ground. City officials are likely to look for more private
money to fund the pilot program.


It is unclear exactly how many units the city will pay for with this round of money,
but much of the experiment will focus on just what it will take to convince
homeowners that they should rent out their back houses to the homeless.



                                                3
“There’s a lot we don’t know yet, so we’re asking what would it take for this to work,
to appeal to enough people to make a difference,” said Amanda Daflos, who heads
Mayor Eric Garcetti’s innovation team, which has focused on the city’s housing crisis.


For months, Ms. Daflos and her colleagues have hosted focus group meetings to
understand what kinds of questions and concerns homeowners might have. When
we visited one focus group this fall, the skepticism was clearly evident.


“There’s a lot of fear when you hear the term homelessness,” said Richelle Saldana, a
33-year-old homeowner and mother of two. “Maybe that is not fair, but it’s true.”


One official in Portland, Ore., where a similar experiment is underway, went as far as
calling the idea “a little cuckoo,” but insisted that people would be eager to “step up
and do a little.”


What do you think — would you be willing to rent out your backyard flat through a
similar program? What could persuade you to do so? Share your thoughts in the
comments or by email: jennifer.medina@nytimes.com

at the downtown Post Office, is dying for lack of water. Waiting for rain is not the solution.

I spent months trying to get this issue resolved, and only contacted Brad out of desperation.

I appreciate your support and recognition. It's your turn to be Mayor.

Dear Danielle,

Thank you for your follow up on the Dawn Redwood. It is a beautiful tree and we should take care of
it whether it is on private or public property.

Kind regards,

Hi Danielle,

Thanks for the photos you dropped off at the Clerk’s Office!

We’re still trying to coordinate with the Post Office about their trees and the irrigation system, but I
wanted to let you know that for now we’re having a water truck water the Dawn Redwood tree once
a week. Hopefully this will be enough to at least stop its current decline.

Have a good weekend.

Subject:             Idea regarding helping with housing


I wanted to pass on an idea that an acquaintance had shared regarding the housing challenge.

Right now in Palo Alto the housing prices are crazy and we have this wonderful Proposition 13 in place. [I love it as a
home owner].
I believe the rentals in Palo Alto account for over 50% of the housing units.

Many home purchasers buy homes to be a rental property ‐ the house next door to our home is a rental, the What's App
person purchased 4 additional homes, Mark Zuckerberg purchased many homes surrounding his home, and there are
many more.

I feel that Proposition 13 should be for homeowners who LIVE in the home they own. It should not be made available to
those who purchase with the intention of renting the home out. My understanding of Prop 13 is that it was to help the
home owners be able to remain in their home. Homeowners NOT renters.

Perhaps if home purchasers know they will need to pay a higher property tax each year, they won't purchase as many
homes, pay the crazy prices they pay to have more homes, and just maybe there will be homes available for people who
want to live and stay in this community. If people want to purchase rentals, pay the taxes.

I hope you can give this some thought. There are just so many people with lots of money that want to benefit from
rentals. So, have them help pay for the infrastructure that is needed in our community.

Dear City Council Members,

I have been a lap swimmer at Rinconada Pool for over 25 years and have used the community pool for health
benefits. My husband and I have raised our three children in Palo Alto and we have always made it a priority to live near
the community pool for lap swims. It is important to our family that the city of Palo Alto continue to offer a public pool
to the community for lap swimming, swim lessons and masters swim club. Rinconada pool is the only public pool in Palo
Alto. Let’s keep this valuable asset for the community.

Thank you for your cooperation and for working on behalf of the community.

Sincerely,

Subject:          Letter in Support of Rinconada Masters



October 29, 2018

To the Palo Alto City Council:

Not all masters swim programs are alike. Not everyone is young, strong, and competitive. Not
everyone is a tri‐athlete or aspiring tri‐athlete. Some of us are beginning swimmers; some of us
are recovering from injuries.

Many swimmers enjoy swimming for fitness with a more relaxed group of masters swimmers. At
Rinconada Masters we enjoy our workouts, but also the comradery of other swimmers who share
our love of swimming but aren’t necessarily competing.

We respectfully ask you to keep the Rinconada Masters program as is rather than allowing Team
Sheeper to establish its own masters program. There are many competitive masters programs in
the area – Menlo Masters and Stanford Masters come to mind.

Though I am a Menlo Park resident, I have swum with Rinconada Masters since 1985. Menlo
Park’s Burgess Pool would be more convenient for me, but there are virtually no times when I,
working full time, can lap swim there, and I believe their masters program is too strenuous for me.

I particularly appreciate Rinconada Masters because it provided me with the opportunity to
recover from a massive rotator cuff injury. If it hadn’t been for this group and Carol MacPherson’s
coaching, I most likely would never have been able to swim again.

Please don’t allow Rinconada Masters unique program to be dissolved.

                           Sincerely,

                           Janet Littlefield

Seriously? How demented does a city council have to be to honor someone for lying in front of congress? Don't spend
time trying to fix problems in your state, such as the highest poverty rate in the country, or people shooting up and
defecating on the sidewalks. No your time is best spent honoring a complete liar. Good job palo alto, you should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

Regarding the Rinconada Masters Swim Program, I hope that something can be worked out here. I don't know anything
about the important aspects of running a swimming pool, but I can say that Carol has an amazing ability to dissect a
swimmer's swim stroke and help them improve. I've had a great experience at Rinconada Masters and I am sure that
everybody can come together around good safety standards and continuing the fine tradition at Rinconada.

Sincerely,

What is Council Leadership?

It is the foundation of a quality community. What happens when a city council
openly steps up to address an overwhelming issue such as traffic? Or housing…or
schools…or parks?

This issue starts a 6-month a case study of Palo Alto’s council leadership. Palo
Alto's study session on Oct 22 may offer a 2019 learning opportunity to all city
councils on the Peninsula. We hope so. Traffic and transportation need leadership
by example.

                               Traffic congestion, safety issues, spillover cut-thru traffic, etc. are everyday realities in
                               Palo Alto and many peninsula cities.

                               Each year Palo Alto conducts a scientific survey of residents' opinions. Traffic is
                               consistently rated as major concern. Palo Alto is commuter town. Only God know what
                               commuters must think!

                               #2 Mayoral mea culpa
                               On July 30 Mayor Liz Kniss stated during a Council meeting “…I think you'll find that
                               the traffic is not as overwhelming as you might think.” This resulted in national
                               news, regional TV coverage and startled citizens. She quickly apologized and her apology
                               was accepted. Mayor Kniss, the Council and staff scheduled a special Town Hall Traffic
Study Session. Seattle CBS

#3 Neighborhood voices
Citizen leaders from multiple neighborhoods took proactive action. No pitchforks….no flaming torches. One neighborhood
conducted a formal citizen survey with Survey Monkey. Another neighborhood convened face-to-face meeting and

neighborhoods are looking at their hot-spots and will communicate to city staff. Palo Alto Weekly



                                                                           Double Quick Action? Or double talk?

Will Palo Alto Council blaze a trail and respond to a heavily
attended townhall meeting on traffic?

Residents sound off
For Palo Alto residents exasperated by worsening traffic congestion, the city
offered some hopeful news: Help is on the way…..expect delays. Many argued
for moratorium on commercial development. Some came armed with surveys,
data sets and anecdotes. One citizen installed a camera at his house for car
counts and documented 33% increase from 2013 to 2018. Close to 100
residents participated and over 30 testified. Another resident made the case for
halting commercial development until city solves traffic problems. He said the
city of Palo Alto is transitioning into a corporate-office park. Palo Alto Weekly

Ed. Comment: Palo Alto has a snarl. Transportation Department is not staffed or funded to address its problems.
The new comprehensive plan is not funded adequately. The City Council is in lame duck status until January and a new
city manager has just begun to organize his senior staff.

When might the new city council set new, funded priorities? A good target date is the first council meeting in April. For
the record, the Oct 22 audience was polled to see if the business community was in attendance. Less than a handful were
interested enough to attend the town hall meeting.

Dear City Council,

60 percent of the homeless are "invisible": they live in cars, RVs, friends sofas, motels,
and they dont have access to online job training.

This means they cannot learn how to create a resume, use email, job search online to keep from living on the streets.

I know this because I work with the invisible homeless.

I have created a solution.

Job training online; accessible from anywhere...for free.

I would like the City Council to approve 5 million dollars so the City and I can get these people the help they deserve.

Please see my website below and please contact me to discuss further. Thank you.

Subject:          plastics: news clip



In environmental news, European lawmakers have voted to ban single-use plastics in
an effort to reduce ocean pollution. The ban includes plastic cutlery, straws and
disposable plates and would take effect starting in 2021. This is EU lawmaker
Frédérique Ries.

Frédérique Ries: “What are the objects we have most often found on the beaches?
That’s single-use plastic. And secondly, are there inexpensive alternatives that are
accessible? If that’s the case, then we’ll change. It’s not complicated. It’s disfiguring
our beaches. It’s killing our oceans. It’s killing animals. It ends up in fishes’ stomachs
and kills them. And at the end of the day, it ends up inside our bodies. There’s an
impact on human health. There are alternatives which exist, which are not expensive
and are often European, so we just change things.”

The regulations still have to be approved by individual governments before becoming
law.

Dear Councilmembers,

The City Manager asked me to provide you an update on the distinctive Dawn Redwood tree at the Post Office. As
mentioned at Monday’s Council meeting, our Urban Forestry group recently began watering the tree with a watering
truck as a temporary measure. The attached article about the Dawn Redwood was published in this morning’s Daily
Post. It includes some information about Dawn Redwood trees provided to the Daily Post by Urban Forester Walter
Passmore, and also indicates that the Post Office will begin watering the tree and is interested in advice from Public
Works and Canopy about the appropriate watering schedule. We will coordinate with Canopy in the coming days to
reach out to the Post Office about the best care for the Dawn Redwood and other trees at the Post Office.

Respectfully,

Brad

I live in Evergreen Park. Stanford has purchased two homes adjacent to mine. I agree that leaving them empty for long
periods of time is deeply disturbing. The management company hired to oversee the houses has no motivation what so
ever to be respectful and considerate and they are not.

I disagree that removing these houses from “the housing pool” and “taking them off the open market” is a bad thing.
The people who can afford to buy these houses on the “open market” are in a class of wealth of people who generally
believe the rules don’t apply to them and have no motivation what so ever to be involved in their communities. The
“open market” is over rated. it has it’s place, but to quote Wendell Barry, “rats and cockroaches live by the laws of
supply and demand.” I’ll take Stanford affiliates as neighbors, thank you very much!~

To whom it may concern,

I am a Palo Alto resident and a Master Swim member for over 30 years. I want to encourage you not to approve the
Team Sheeper, Inc. aquatics contract as proposed at the recent Parks and Recreation Commission meeting of October
23, City of Palo Aquatics Contract Update, until a mutually agreeable solution can be worked out over the continuation
of the long standing Rinconada Masters Swim team.

I appears that the Recreation Community Services Department’s eagerness to complete a contract has not allowed for a
reasonable effort to find a mutually agreeable solution. Their major safety concern (number of lifeguards on duty) can
be reasonably resolved.

Thanks for your help .

Re: Impact of a 2% Across-the-Board Cut of 2019 Proposed Budget




Council Members:




Listening to the discussion tonight where Council was discussing the proposed 2% across-the-board reduction—there
seemed to be some confusion about what such a budget reduction might involve.

Using data from the 2019 proposed budget, which laws out the expenditures by department, a simple 2% reduction was
applied—which can be found in the right-most column.




Please take the time to consider these numbers and not discuss this matter without the hard numbers which are so easily

Subject:          rent control



To Danny Glover : Thank you for sending me Bernie Sanders' remarks about California's Prop 10,
repeal i of Costa- Hawkins. I heartily agree, but repeal is not a game changer; it merely frees the
cities to impose rent control if they want to, and they mostly haven't wanted to. The principle of
Capitalism is that money is the measure of all things. With money, you can build skyscrapers,
factories, hospitals and nuclear submarines, and the present housing crisis is a reflection of that
principle. In the late 50's, Terman, a distinguished Stanford professor, brought Palo Alto a
development idea. Stanford could put its many acres of undeveloped land together with its resident
genius scientists and engineers, to produce high tech products. Palo Alto then rezoned hundreds of
acres from "housing" to "industrial". The wealth generated made the property more valuable; the new
jobs drew in huge new demand, and you know about supply and demand. Property tax supports the
schools, ergo, Palo Alto schools have many AP classes, but the schools where the workers live, in
East Palo Alto, consider themselves blessed if most of the students graduate from high school. The
very large number of workers living at a distance from the workplace, and obliged to commute by car,
create monumental congestion and toxic air.
I believe the solution is to call on the parties whose well-being depends on the workers to require that
large companies build housing for their workers on their own land, at the rate of one bedroom per
worker; that would include teachers and municipal workers, and would simultaneously solve the
problem of housing too expensive for teachers, which drives our school costs up but never high
enough to pay for housing. The same principle applies to other civil service, but the teachers are
most essential. All public buildings should have some housing in the air space above them.

The US government should offer housing to on surplus army bases to all veterans, paid for according
to income, especially to those suffering from PTSD which makes them a danger to themselves and
others,
so that they might be cared for, and monitored. It's a disgrace that we have homeless veterans, and
the cost of housing them should be borne by the entire nation that has benefited from their services,
in an orderly and dependable manner, rather than by a catch-as-catch-can effort by individuals and
individual communities.

The flaws and the assets of the national pension system should be understood so as to provide
housing for retired persons who have paid into and been vested in Social Security system. Since
participation is involuntary, it behooves the nation to see that some level of housing, however modest,
must be provided for retired persons, and in the industrialized part of the country near doctors and
grocery stores, not in a tent in the national forest. However, these pensioners have two advantages
over other prospective tenants: their monthly stipend is absolutely guaranteed by the full faith and
credit of the US government, and they are no longer dependent on the automobile to get to a
job. They would be well served by economy of scale, many minimal private units, like hotel bedroom
and bath suites, clustered so as to share common spaces and amenities with others, like the
swimming pool, large dining room, a workshop or computer room, spacious landscaped grounds, and
a vehicle to take people to the doctor, library or public transportation. No matter how much the land
                                                        1
costs, there is some number of single householders or couples --maybe as much as hundreds, rather
than dozens--who could afford the cost if it were shared., and this housing need not be publicly
subsidized or even publicly built if the cities will permit it and the state will facilitate the formation of
public banks where small savers can invest in it.

This type of housing has not been permitted by city zoning for two reasons: first, it serves the needs
of people with little money, where cities would prefer to be inhabited by prosperous taxpayers and
would like the appearance of the city to be prepossessing, and second because the neighbors do not
want to have to compete for free parking on the public street. But the building inhabited by many
rather than few is worth just as much and therefore pays as much in taxes, and can easily be just as
attractive; moreover, if it were expensive looking, it would attract many widows and widowers who are
occupying large houses and paying for space they no longer need, when renting out those homes to
families with children would finance a more agreeable lifestyle.There are thousands of homeless on
the waiting list for subsidized housing; at least one or two shared buildings could be limited to those
without cars, or at least with cars housed elsewhere and off the street.

This type of co-housing can also be suitable for young workers who don't have families and don't
have cars, and it is certainly possible to design modules so they can be adapted --put together-- for
people who enlarge their families, but traditional homes, even very small ones, seem to be right for
families. Hopefully, removing these groups whose lodging can be taken care of by other means will
clear the way to use our public housing money to house all families in need of housing for their
children.

Mobile homes and mobile home parks should be protected, and suitable streets--not residential
streets--designated for RVs. Every city should have some areas where car campers can park, with a
nearby bathroom; where parking structures are built, they should always have bathrooms and be
available for car campers to rent space in them at night.

Cities, and condominium governing boards should not be allowed to put limits on whether homes may
be rented out, and to how many people, and should not permit leases to be broken or rent decontrol
with change of ownership.


Of course low income housing should not be torn down to clear the way for more expensive purposes
but we must recognize that often it is government which forces it to be torn down, by demanding
expensive upgrades that the owner can't avoid.,by giving permission for the land to be converted to
some other use, by forcing the owner, through taxes, to give it up so it may fulfill its Capitalist destiny
of returning the maximum amount of money to the system, as in urban renewal and the estate tax.
Like Mr. Glover, my sisters and I were born in San Francisco and grew up there, and our family's
property there had been used for rental, under rent control, for seventy years; without Prop 13 we
would have been forced to sell. After Prop 13, the federal government took over and saw to the
dispossession of us and our rent-controlled tenants by simple fiat: Congress passed a law that
parents couldn't give property to their children above an amount which was not enough to save even
one house.
All three homes had to be sold and the rent controlled tenants and my daughter, a schoolteacher, and
her family, evicted. The low income tenants should have saved them


We should end homelessness by any means possible. Where religious and charitable groups are
willing to help the homeless we should help them, not hinder them., and certainly not charge them a
permit fee! For instance, where churches permit cars in their parking lot overnight, we should provide
                                                      2
the porta-potty. If the shelters are full, homeless should be accommodated on the floor of city hall or
other public buildings during the hours of darkness. Overnight busses should carry emergency
blankets and not make the homeless leave the bus periodically.
Stephanie Munoz, Housing Committee,
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, Peninsula Branch.




 Rapidly rising land value is the situation where rent control and prohibition of mass eviction is
needed. Likewise mobile parks should have protected status, and cities should furnish some safe
place, with a bathroom nearby, where cars can park overnight. All parking structures should have
bathrooms, and be available to rent overnight.

I swam with Rinconada Masters for four year, then moved to Mountain View Masters. That was twenty years ago. I left
because of Carol MacPherson. So did a lot of other people, including long time assistant coach Cindy Baxter. She was
inattentive and rude as a “coach” and only did the bare minimum to keep the club running. Before Team Sheeper took
over, Carol used her privileged status and inside contacts to run her own, private swim school out of Rinconada using
the site itself for prominent advertising for her program as well and comandeering prime times and pool space.

If Team Sheeper wants to nix their contract it’s because of Carol MacPherson.

PS ‐ If you want more swimmers at Rinconada, please get that damn boiler fixed! I can’t swim there until they’ve fixed
the cold showers. I understand the boiler is the responsibility of the city.

Subject:           Rinconada Pool



To whom it may concern:

As an 18 year resident of Palo Alto and a long term lap swimmer at Rinconada pool, I would like to express my
concerns about the proposed changes in management of the pool. Although I have not been involved with
the Master’s program, my family has been involved with the pool in all other aspects‐ swim lessons, PASA
swim team, lap swimming, as well as a daughter who taught swim lessons.

My concerns are as follows:

1. A total lack of transparency from the City rec. department employees who are working on the
contract with team Sheeper

2. A total lack of communication with the swimming community regarding these potential
changes

3. Mostimportantly, a total lack of support of the Palo Alto residents’
concerns who utilize the pool.
The swimmers and residents were last included in a meeting in March in which our concerns were
voiced. The city employees seem to have already made the determination that the pool will be
outsourced. The majority, if not all of the swimmers at that meeting either do not want the pool
outsourced, or if outsourced, in speaking for the lap swimmers, we do not want our lap swim
hours changed or the number of lanes that are available to the lap swimmers during those
dedicated hours changed.

The rate for seniors has already been increased by 66% and for the non seniors, close to a 50%
increase.
Have there been any objective budget figures to show that taking these increases in to account,
has it been at all financially beneficial to the city to outsource the pool?

There are of course many other issues to voice here and I think that some of the limited number
of swimmers that have been aware of these meetings have been attending City Council and the
Park and Rec. Commission meetings to express all those concerns, but the major concern here
that the council members should be aware of is that the residents of Palo Alto who frequently
utilize Rinconada Pool are not supportive of the changes that are being proposed by outsourcing
the pool. Additionally, with so much discontent and many swimmers who are still uninformed of
                                                       1
the issues due to the lack of communication, it would be prudent to communicate with all
swimmers, allow all swimmers a voice, table this decision until further input is given, and
additionally, if there is a decision to outsource the pool, shorten any contract offered as a 5 year
contract with so much discontent seems to be a poor management decision.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns.

My name is David Levinson. I have been a Palo Alto resident continuously since 1977, and a member of the
Rinconada Masters Swim Club the entire time. I am greatly distraught at the prospect of our wonderful adult
swimming program being eliminated at the whim of Tim Sheeper. The Rinconada Masters have been a central
part of my life for the past 41 years and I am filled with despair that the Palo Alto City Council apparently is not
able or willing to intervene to prevent Sheeper from abolishing us with a mere stroke of a pen.

To put this in perspective, let me give you a very brief background on Masters swimming. It has been known
since the late 1950s that simply swimming nonstop laps is not an effective means of cardiovascular
conditioning. Researchers discovered that one needs the intensity of structured interval training in the water to
gain significant benefit. Once lap swimming had been replaced by intervals as the basis for competitive
swimming training, records began to tumble at all levels. In the early 1970s, Masters swimming came into being
nationwide for the purpose of providing adults with the opportunity to do real swimming training under the
supervision of real swimming coaches. The Rinconada Masters Swim Club was one of the first of these Masters
teams. Rinconada employs a unique combination of highly structured, but low pressure, swimming training that
is different from most other Masters programs.

Under the tutelage of Rinconada coaches Cindy Baxter (retired) and Carol MacPherson, the latter having been
my coach for 41 years, I went from being a mediocre college swimmer to an 8-time national champion during my
years with Rinconada.

Now I am 68 years old, retired from competition, and suffer from several age-related ailments, among them atrial
fibrillation and peripheral neuropathy. Thanks in large part to Rinconada’s interval training program, I am now
free of atrial fibrillation symptoms, and am retaining a large amount of strength in my legs despite the neuropathy.

I owe much to the Rinconada Masters, and I don’t know what I would do if it were gone from my life after all of
these years. I’ve done workouts at other Masters clubs when I’ve been on travel, and it’s just not the same. I
hope you can find it within you to use your good offices to save the Rinconada Masters, which means so much to
me.

Dear Council Members,

I couldn’t come to the meeting on traffic, but I have two observations:

—there certainly is much more traffic on many artery streets than 12‐15 years ago. Embarcadero & Middlefield I know
best. Stop light at Oregon backs up on Middlefield many blocks north between 4‐6:30 pm, often well‐past Santa Rita.

—I don’t see enough discussion of the impact of the housing rush you seem engaged in on local car trips. Commute
trips seem to be the focus. But, I, for instance, make about three local round rips a day, often more, and my wife and I
don’t even have children or other family members in the house. I’d venture that the growth in traffic is significantly
about local car trips.

Your truly,

Council members,

On 10-16-18, the Finance Committee considered an item about smart meters. Here's the agenda.
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?t=71592.98&BlobID=67079
And staff report (110 pages).
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/67112
And the video.
http://midpenmedia.org/finance-committee-50-10162018/
The Smart meter item is from 1:49:00 to 3:04:23.

Below the "######" line is a transcript of the video. I have added my comments (paragraphs beginning with "###").

I'd also like to mention something that was not discussed at the meeting. Cybersecurity is an issue. The staff report
assumes that the electric meters will have a remote-shutoff capability, but doesn't say how much that will
save. This article warns of the risk.

Thanks.

TRANSCRIPT:

1:49:00:

Chair Scharff: All right. Now we're on to the next one.

1:49:01:

Dean Batchelor: So, before I introduce this next topic, Judith Schwartz, our UAC vice chair, would like to speak to this
item. So, probably after we make this presentation, first, I think. And then, is it OK if she comes to the table and
speaks? Or do you want her at the podium?

1:49:20:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) No, she -- no -- she can come speak when you're done.

1:49:22:


                                                             1
Dean Batchelor: OK. All right. Great. Thank you. OK. So, on to the next item -- is to look and have a discussion
around our Utilities' smart grid assessment. So, Utilities staff, along with consultants, developed a strategic technology
roadmap somewhere around five years ago, that we've been working on. And we identified some major critical
technology investments, such as the replacement of the customer information -- the billing system. And then we also
looked at what we're calling today is the development of this AMI project. And tonight we are bringing this forward to you,
to have some discussion around the smart grid project portion of it. So, with that, we have a presentation that we would
like to discuss. So, Shiva, is that you again? Or ...

1:50:22:

Jon Abendschein: Just a couple of the things that I'd say. One of the things that we mentioned at the last presentation,
early on, was the increasing penetration of electric vehicles, solar, and storage in the community. And, you know, as
levels of penetration of those resources increase, we're going to see both potential opportunities to use those resources
to decrease costs, you know, through the use of AMI. Also, the -- And also the potential cost impacts, if we're not able to,
you know, carefully manage the integration. And I think it's relevant to this discussion because, you know, as the
commissioners know, AMI is more and more common in the utility industry, and it's a critical foundation to be able to take
advantage of some of those benefits, and to avoid some of those cost impacts. So, what we're coming to you with tonight
is the roadmap. It's only intended to be an early indicator that we're on the right track. Formal approval of budgets and
contracts will come later, and -- as part of the annual budget process. Or once it's timely to do an RFP. So, with that, I'll
turn it over to Shiva for the presentation.

1:51:48:

Shiva Swaminathan: Thanks, Jon. So, again, the commonality between this and the EIRP is, the driver for smart grid is
also electric. The advent of PVs, EVs, storage systems, and flexible loads in the community. How do we take -- leverage
those resources to reduce overall costs and prevent system degradation?

### I won't transcribe the presentation slides. The presentation slides were not included in the "presentations" document
for this meeting.
https://cityofpaloalto.org/gov/agendas/finance/default.asp
The presentation slides on the video have limited resolution and are hard to read.

1:52:13:

So, the driver for this -- So, the request today is to accept the staff findings, and -- as Jon mentioned -- and then set us on
a path over the next five to six years, to plan for and implement this program, along with other utility technology
programs. This was one of the key programs also identified in the Utilities Strategic Plan, when it was approved last year,
and is a foundational technology, as Jon was mentioning.

1:52:45:

So, I'll briefly talk about smart grid -- what the history of AMI in California, and Palo Alto, in the past. We had a consultant
engaged over a year, last year, to do a detailed assessment. And then we'll also, in addition to the quantitative benefits,
also talk about qualitative benefits, which we're not able to quantify. And then, staffing, and next steps.

1:53:12:

So, smart grid is -- is a broader term. It's just not smart meters. But a smart meter is a foundational technology to enable
smart grid. So, it is essentially communicating and control technologies to monitor utility networks. So, currently, for
example, the electric network -- we don't have visibility into what is going on in our distribution system -- electric
distribution system -- downstream. We know at our nine substations what's happening. But downstream, along the
feeder, we have less visibility. This will assist with creating better visibility and improve reliability. It's enabling technology
to do these broad six areas:
* greater energy and water and efficiency,
* enable faster detection and restoration of electric outages,
* maintain service reliability. We have additional EVs and solar coming on the distribution system that can create issues
for our distribution system. That will help -- This technology will help us maintain the distribution system reliability.
* we can detect and fix water leaks, and
* implement time-of-use [TOU] electric rates for customers, and
* overall increase customer experience.
So, these are the kind of the broad things it will enable.
                                                                 2
1:54:34:

So, what is smart grid? As illustrated here, to the left here, it is essentially meters, with radio capabilities, which will mesh
with each other and talk to gateways, or other devices, which will talk through a public carrier, like AT&T or Verizon. And
then, it will store the data in a meter data management system, which then can be used by different -- for the billing folks,
the outage management, improve reliability, the GIS, and for engaging customers, to reduce -- and -- their consumption,
and better utilize resources. So, that's broadly an AMI system is. So, to do that, we have to replace the entire electric
meter. This electric meter typically costs about $100 for a residential customer. And a little more expensive -- $400 to
$500 -- for commercial customers. But on the gas meters, AMI means we just repla- -- there is a radio at the back, here,
which -- the meter will not be replaced, just -- only a radio dial will be replaced in the -- your gas meter. And the water
meter, also, there will be another radio installed on the water meter, to communicate the usage on an hourly basis.

### Previously, staff has said water and gas meters might transmit only once or twice per day, to minimize the load on
the meter's battery. So, apparently, each transmission might transmit multiple data points. Will the system have the
flexibility to transmit as soon as it notices that an unusual amount of water or gas has been consumed?

So that's what the technology looks like.

1:55:56:

And this has been prevalent in California -- and, if you probably know, in -- since the late 2000s. Currently, about 80
percent of California customers -- except for the LADWP,

### LADWP is the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power. LADWP has about 1.5 million electric customers.
https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/aboutus/a-power/a-p-factandfigures?_adf.ctrl-
state=up8vp0hl5_21&_afrLoop=210004881416431
Currently, it does not have smart meters, although a 52,000-customer pilot program is said to be in the works.
https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/aboutus/a-power/a-p-smartgridla?_adf.ctrl-
state=up8vp0hl5_21&_afrLoop=211338007708337

which is a large electric and water utility, all other invest- -- all other -- most other utilities have -- electric customers -- on
AMI. And on natural gas, pretty much 99 percent of the gas users in California have AMI.

1:56:30:

Chair Scharff: So, isn't that misleading to say that though? Because -- I mean, how many non-investor-owned utilities
have natural gas?

### I think Chair Scharff's point is that in California, investor-owned utilities (IOUs) -- both electric and gas -- are required
by law to have smart meters. So the fact that IOUs have smart meters doesn't prove they're cost-effective.
http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/uploadedfiles/cpuc_public_website/content/about_us/organization/divisions/office_of_government
al_affairs/smart%20grid%20annual%20report%202017.pdf

1:56:42:

Shiva Swaminathan: Three.

1:56:43:

Chair Scharff: In the entire state?

1:56:44:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

1:56:44:

Chair Scharff: That's what I thought. So -- I mean, the investor-owned utilities have different incentives than everyone
else.


                                                                  3
1:56:51:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

1:56:52:

Chair Scharff: So, you know -- And the reason I say it's misleading is that it implies that there's some value to that
information. And it implies -- I mean, what you really should -- could say is -- you know, which you did, currently, all
electric and gas IOUs have AMI.

### An IOU is an investor-owned utility.

And there's only three other natural gas ones. And they're small. So, that's why you're going to have 99 -- you're GOING
to have 99 percent of California -- all natural gas customers. Whether or not we, you know -- I assume. Right? Whether
or not people do it or not. Because there are only three of us who are natural gas utilities.

### I think Chair Scharff is saying that we already know that all investor-owned utilities in California have smart meters,
because government demanded it, but that doesn't tell you how cost-effective it is. If we knew what fraction of publicly-
owned utilities in California had smart meters, that might tell you more about how cost-effective smart meters are.

### But not all publicly-owned utilities (POUs) are in the same situation. For Palo Alto, manual meter reading is less
expensive per meter than for most POUs, because Palo Alto has electric, gas, and water utilities. Once the City pays for
the meter reader to get to a premises, it can amortize that cost over three meter reads (usually).

### As I understand it, the cost of electricity to Palo Alto's electric utility doesn't vary as much, at different times of day
and different seasons, as it does in many other communities. So, if the City's time-of-use (TOU) rates must be based on
its costs, then they will be less effective at changing behavior, and there will be less reason to have TOU rates at all.

1:57:23:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right. Right. Yup. That's a fair point. Long Beach, which is the -- One, Coalinga, is
miniscule. The other one is Long Beach Water & Gas.

1:57:38:

Chair Scharff: And we're miniscule. I mean, we're -- what --

1:57:40:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yup.

1:57:40:

Chair Scharff: Right? Or not. We're not one percent of California customers [laughs].

1:57:44:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right. OK. So -- And that's in terms of the -- point well taken. The 50 percent -- so this is -- the top
one is the point about investor-owned utilities. And publicly-owned utilities like Palo Alto electric, gas, and water. Again,
just roughly about 50 percent of those in the POU community.

### A POU is a publicly-owned utility.

And then, -- And so, back in 2012, Council requested us to take a look at it. And we came back to the Council saying that
it was not prudent at that time. And so, the Council recommended deferring that investment at that time. For the -- allow
the technology and applications to mature. And await improved economics. Since then, the costs haven't come down too
much. It's about the same. But the applications and the impetus to have it in place -- that has increased considerably, as
you saw in the EIRP presentation. So, again, going back -- So, in 2013, we implemented a pilot AMI program for 300
homes. And we learned quite a bit. There were quite a few water leak detections we were able to make. About 30
percent of the customers who were on that pilot over a 3-4 year period saw some leakage detection. We implemented
time-of-use rates for electric vehicle customers. Had about 300 customers was on a wait list. When they heard about
                                                               4
this pilot, they wanted to sign on, but we said we were closed for that pilot. So, there has been some interest since. And
we gained a lot of operational experience through that pilot program. So, staff is knowledgeable and able to implement it
at full scale.

1:59:32:

We got some good press where this -- I won't play the video, but -- you know, this customer, a resident who was out of
town, was able to detect their leaks while they were out of town, and they were able to estimate -- save about $100 on
their bill.

1:59:52:

So, that's, again, history. So, we had this consultant take a look at things -- who is also an implementation
consultant. And they did the assessment which you have in the report in front of you. But I'm going to focus only on item
number 1, 2, and 10. So, look at:
* [1] the financial cost benefit assessment,
* [2] some qualitative and strategic benefits, and also
* [10] impact of AMI on customer utility bills -- what is that going to look like. We can get into the -- more details if needed.

2:00:20:

So, this is a table of potential capital costs. As you see, the top three items are -- include electric, gas, and water meter
replacement. And it also includes a $2 million installation cost embedded in them. And then this portion is more of
integration costs with our billing system. And then, there is a lot of staffing engagement required. We're estimating it at
$1.5 [million] to $2 million over a 2-3 year period. So, this, again, internal staffing costs. Estimated [total] cost of $18
[million] to $19 million.

2:00:58:

In terms of benefits -- ongoing operational benefits -- we estimated the annual cost of actually operating this new system -
- we need additional staff with better -- new skills, to operate and maintain the system. That is an incremental cost of $1.9
million [annually]. But there is an offsetting savings of about $3.3 million [annually], primarily made up of two buckets:
* 1 is staffing-related savings. The meter-reading staff roles will no longer be needed. That's about $1.6 million per
year. And then,
* [2] conservation and efficiency-related savings -- about $1.7 million [annually]. About half and half of the value. So the
net benefit of about $1.4 million [annually]. Which will go towards paying of the $19 million capital expenditure.

2:01:53:

Chair Scharff: How are we going to do the capital expenditure? Are we going to bond for it? Are we going to just use it
out of ...

2:01:57:

Shiva Swaminathan: Electric's -- We'll get into that.

2:01:59:

Chair Scharff: ... Special Projects ...

2:02:00:

Shiva Swaminathan: Special Projects Reserve.

2:02:00

Chair Scharff: Calaveras Fund.

2:02:01:

Shiva Swaminathan: OK. That's for the electric. And for gas and water, it could potentially -- a loan from that fund.
                                                                5
### If the Electric Special Projects Fund is supposed to be used to benefit electric ratepayers, how does lending money
to the water and gas utilities benefit electric ratepayers? See this 11-01-11 resolution.

And the 11-01-11 staff report (49 pages).
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/42839

2:02:07:

Chair Scharff: OK.

2:02:07:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um. What we -- What we didn't quantify is a bunch of other items which we'll talk about in more
detail. So, this is a look at an MPV basis -- what you have over an 18-year period, at a 3.5 percent discount rate. As you
see, the total life cycle costs of the system is about break-even. So, what you have is a capital here. Capital cost of what
we just estimated. And this is ongoing operational costs. Versus the savings.

### Some people think that today's smart meters will become obsolete in far fewer than 18 years.
09-25-18: "Security Risks and Technology Obsolescence Reduce Smart Meter Expected Lifetimes"
https://smartgridawareness.org/2018/09/25/technology-obsolescence-reduces-smart-meter-lifetimes/

### In fact, this source claims, "... the smart meters deployed in the last 1–3 years are already obsolete in terms of the
data communications standards, hardware and cybersecurity capabilities that exist on these meters."
01-25-18: "IoT / IIoT Device Companies Are Making The 'Smart Meter Mistake.' "
https://hackernoon.com/iot-iiot-device-companies-are-making-the-smart-meter-mistake-2ab1471ff078

### This 09-04-18 article by the American Public Power Association reports on the rejection of some smart meter
proposals.
https://www.publicpower.org/periodical/article/regulators-reject-smart-meter-proposal-kentucky
Among the reasons were that the proposals didn't provide enough evidence that the meters would last 20 years, and the
remaining useful life of the existing analog meters was not considered.

2:02:45:

And we then looked at what is the impact on customer bills. So, the cons- -- So, the ...

2:02:51:

Council Member Tanaka: (unamplified) Wait. Hold on a second. So, **, you're saying that ...

2:02:54:

**: Microphone, please, **.

### City officials often forget to turn on the microphone before speaking (and to turn off the microphone after
speaking). On 03-26-18, Council considered upgrading the audio/visual system, but there was essentially no discussion
of the audio. For example, could the microphone's on-off switch control whether the microphone's audio was amplified
and broadcast to the meeting room (to avoid feedback issues) but NOT control whether the audio was captured on the
video recording? Anyhow, a low-tech alternative would be to assign a staff person to say "microphone, please" as
appropriate. (In this transcript, there were 53 "unamplified" occurrences, not including the one in this sentence, but only
three "microphone, please"s, not including the ones in this sentence..)

2:02:56:

Council Member Tanaka: You're saying that -- uh -- that -- uh -- that this is -- this isn't exactly the total cost -- that it's a
break-even? Is that what you're saying?

2:03:09:

Shiva Swaminathan: No, look at -- The top one is capital expenditure.
                                                                  6
2:03:11:

Council Member Tanaka: Yeah.

2:03:12:

Shiva Swaminathan: That's the ...

2:03:17:

Council Member Tanaka: So, -- OK. And are these savings like re-occurring?

2:03:22:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes. To the right. The bottom, the right, is recurring.

2:03:28:

Council Member Tanaka: So the op-ex is $27 million. And then we get a recurring $43 million?

2:03:35:

Jon Abendschein: (unamplified) This is all on a present-value basis ...

2:03:37:

Council Member Tanaka: Oh, I see.

2:03:38:

Jon Abendschein: ... so that this is the present value of the ongoing costs as well as the first.

2:03:44:

Council Member Tanaka: Yeah. And why are the numbers so close to each other?

2:03:48:

Shiva Swaminathan: (unamplified) That's analysis ** -- No, just kidding. (amplified) We made some -- assess -- assess
-- assessment. It came out to be this way. We -- But we can show you the variability, too.

2:03:59:

Council Member Tanaka: OK. **.

2:03:59:

Shiva Swaminathan: So, around this variabil- --

2:04:01:

Council Member Tanaka: ** analysis.

2:04:01:

Shiva Swaminathan: Ah. No, it's not ...

2:04:01:

Council Member Tanaka: Yeah.
                                                               7
2:04:01:

Shiva Swaminathan: So, we looked at the same NPV on a -- for different assumptions. It can vary anywhere from
negative $15 million to positive $8 million.

2:04:13:

Jon Abendschein: (unamplified) ** ...

2:04:15:

Chair Scharff: Could you just say that again? Just repeat that.

2:04:18:

Shiva Swaminathan: So, the -- This is on NPV. It says it's zero. But that could vary, depending on the assumptions,
from negative $14 million to positive $8 million.

2:04:31:

Chair Scharff: So, what would cause a negative $14 million?

2:04:33:

Shiva Swaminathan: OK, we'll -- We can go through that. So ...

2:04:37:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) Can I ask a question before we leave this slide?

2:04:38:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes.

2:04:39:

Vice Mayor Filseth: It looks to me like you're counting on quite a bit of savings from conservation, as a result of doing this.

2:04:46:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:04:47:

Vice Mayor Filseth: What's the driver for the conservation?

2:04:50:

Shiva Swaminathan: OK. We can talk about that. So, there is leaka- -- So, OK. This is a good slide to go with.

2:05:02:

Jon Abendschein: (unamplified) **

2:05:03:

Dean Batchelor: (unamplified) **

2:05:04:


                                                               8
Shiva Swaminathan: Sure. So, the top is about half a percent reduction. This is called conservation voltage
reduction. So, we have the ability to manage our voltages more -- in a narrower band, ...

2:05:17:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK.

2:05:17:

Shiva Swaminathan: ... and that has the ability to save customers about half a percent. And then, for electric -- gas -- so,
on the electric, gas, and water -- For electric, there are customer programs which -- informational programs -- we could
roll out, which can inform customers, which will help them -- more aware of their usage. For example, the OPower report,
which we had, increased customer awareness, providing -- Many of you probably received an OPower report, where you
compare your usage with other customers.

### This is an odd example, in that it speaks to what the City can do if it DOESN'T have smart meters.

2:05:56:

Chair Scharff: That's the one that says ...

2:05:57:

Shiva Swaminathan: And we estimated ...

2:05:57:

Chair Scharff: ... you're better than 90 percent of your neighbors. Or you're the same. Or you're worse.

2:06:01:

Shiva Swaminathan: And we estimated that, for electric, that -- to have saved about 1.5 percent of load -- customer
load. And for natural gas, 2 percent. So this is a verified number, through M&V. Ah ...

2:06:12:

Chair Scharff: **

2:06:13:

Shiva Swaminathan: Measurement & Verification process.

### Apparently sometimes called Evaluation, Measurement & Verification (EM&V).
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/45622
https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/what_is_emv.pdf

### I don't think EM&V can verify an estimate before the measured data is available. Staff may be saying that in the
case of the OPower reports, electric consumption dropped 1.5 percent and gas consumption dropped 2 percent (during
the time that the City was sending out OPower reports?), but I don't know how staff can claim that the OPower reports
were the cause of these decreases. Is staff saying that the actual decreases observed were accurately predicted by
estimates made before the OPower program started?

### How should EM&V score electric consumption increases that result from switching from gas to electric appliances, or
from gasoline to electric cars?

Commissioner Schwartz: (unamplified) No? OK.

2:06:24:

Dean Batchelor: No. Not yet. OK.

2:06:36:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) And those -- (amplified) those are contingent on having smart meters.

2:06:40:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. So, over and above our -- what we're able to -- So, currently, we estimate that through our
existing programs, we can save about 0.7 percent per year. That's anywhere from large commercial customer building
retrofits to -- all that which we achieve ...

Shiva Swaminathan: So, **

2:06:58:

Vice Mayor Filseth: After AMI?

Shiva Swaminathan: After AMI, incremental. So, currently, our 10-year goal is about 5 percent. And we think
incrementally -- And part of that 5 percent, we have included, for example, some of these potential goals. CVR is part of
the potential for 5 years.

### CVR is Conservation Voltage Reduction.

### How confident is staff that CVR will result in 0.5 percent energy saving? For loads like clothes dryers and TVs,
wouldn't the savings be more like zero?


                                                            10
### How much data traffic does the kind of CVR staff proposes require? This paper describes a system -- closed loop
voltage reduction (CLVR) -- deployed at Morristown (TN) Utility Systems which uses their "high-speed
FiberNET." It checks line voltages "several times a second."
https://www.tantalus.com/news_releases/pdf/12.18.12-REV-Tantalus-MUS-CLVR-whitepaper-FINAL.pdf

So, in summary, it's our residential and commercial electric programs, greater awareness in using this technology, um,
water leakage detection. We -- that's considerable. And we don't have a good feel on how much all the gas utilities are
doing -- leakage detection for natural gas. But we have -- that's more of a safety-driven program. We have not been able
to quantify what that is. But that will play -- come into play as well.

2:07:48:

Vice Chair Fliseth: So, in -- conservation savings avoided costs, $15.5 million.

2:07:55:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:07:55:

Vice Chair Filseth: I heard water leakage in there.

2:07:59:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes.

2:07:59:

Vice Chair Filseth: And I heard the marketing campaign to get people to use less energy ...

2:08:07:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:08:08:

Vice Chair Filseth: ... that wouldn't -- wouldn't be -- wouldn't be feasible without AMI.

2:08:12:

Jon Abendschein: Well, I don't -- I think you're bringing up the OPower as an example of ...

2:08:18:

Vice Chair Filseth: Just asking about this chart here.

2:08:20:

Jon Abendschein: ... informational programs. It wouldn't just actually be rejuvenating the OPower program. That doesn't
require smart grid. It's the -- right -- It's the -- It's the actual availability of peo- -- of data to people. And the use of that,
either through -- you know, either through campaigns, marketing -- either through them looking at it on our own -- on
THEIR own -- or us calling attention to it, or a third-party provider that they have, calling their attention to it through their
smart meter data.

### How would the City know that a third party provider had the right to look at a particular customer's data?

You know, maybe through an app. I think we're raising OPower as an example of how information can be effective. Do
you have the back-up slide that shows the -- the percentage savings that you were assuming?

2:09:16:


                                                                 11
Shiva Swaminathan: (unamplified) So, this is, again, ...

2:09:17:

Jon Abendschein: I'm sorry. This is a -- you need to look -- something -- we can break this out a little bit -- but you need
to look at that center square there, where you see the conservation for residential customers -- water, gas, and
electric. We're assuming about two-point -- 1 to 2 percent. Which is in line -- it's a little bit higher than what we saw for
the informational program we sent -- we had before. But we expect that with hourly data, you'll get a much more effective
response.

### The staff report (PDF page 4) says electric meters will record data every 15 minutes.

2:09:49:

Vice Mayor Filseth: So, if I understand what you just said, you're assuming that after AMI, residential customers will save
1 or 2 percent of their total -- total energy usage, because of access to better data.

### How would the City know how much conservation was caused by giving their customers AMI information about their
usage and how much was caused by simply raising rates? As a thought experiment, the City might try just raising rates,
and put the money in another special fund, say, for undergrounding, or for a fourth transmission line. (I'm not saying,
necessarily, that I believe that how much a customer should pay those projects should be determined by how much
electricity the customer consumes.)

### Is the City really interested in conserving electricity, per se, or only in minimizing its cost (by shifting when people use
it)?

### Years ago, Council Member Scharff asked whether, given that the City's electricity was carbon-neutral, that meant
that conservation was not even necessary. I don't remember what he thought the answer should be. Some people think
that whenever the City uses electricity generated by fossil fuels, buying offsets doesn't completely neutralize that.

2:10:06:

Shiva Swaminathan: (unamplified) Correct. Yes. So, a classic example (amplified) people talk about and I've
experienced this -- I live in PG&E service territory -- is seeing how much phantom load you have at night. Middle of night.

2:10:16:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Um hum.

2:10:16:

Shiva Swaminathan: All the lights are off.

2:10:18:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) So you start pulling things off ...

2:10:20:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK. OK.

2:10:21:

Shiva Swaminathan: Looking at that type of stuff.

2:10:22:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK. One or two percent doesn't seem dramatic. OK.

2:10:28:


                                                               12
Chair Scharff: So, I also wanted to ask a couple questions on this slide. So, when we do present-value costs and
benefits, the $43.82 million ..

2:10:36:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um hum.

2:10:36:

Chair Scharff: ... is what it's going to cost the utility.

2:10:41:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um. Yes.

2:10:44:

Chair Scharff: Right?

2:10:44:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes.

2:10:44:

Chair Scharff: The $43.83 million in savings has no relationship to what the utility saves. It's what customers -- It's your
projection of what customers might save. So -- No? Am I wrong?

2:10:58:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes.

2:11:00:

Chair Scharff: OK. I'm wrong. 'Cause -- I'm confused, on the conservation savings, how that saves the utility money.

2:11:05:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right.

2:11:06:

Chair Scharff: It doesn't.

2:11:07:

Shiva Swaminathan: It does. And that's why that's the key here. So, here you see at avoided costs. So, the
conservation saving is -- every unit of energy or water a customer saves, we buy less units from outside.

2:11:23:

Vice Mayor Filseth: So that's -- So that's -- So that is commodity cost.

2:11:26:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:11:26:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK. From the 1 to 2 percent energy savings from customers.


                                                             13
2:11:29:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:11:30:

Chair Scharff: OK. So, you can buy less. But I actually thought -- And, you know, correct me if I'm wrong. 'Cause this is
complicated stuff. But I always thought, the more load we have, the more money your utility actually makes. That we
have a number of fixed costs in running a utility ...

2:11:45:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:11:45:

Chair Scharff: ... and so, therefore, by -- While conservation is a good thing -- and don't get me wrong -- and I would
push for conservation -- we actually make less money as a utility. And that the commodity prices are not necessarily -- I
mean, buying less does not mean we save money. It may actually mean that it would cost us money, because less fixed
costs to spread -- to spread that sale over. In terms of what we sell -- There's a fixed cost component -
- Right. Right. So, I'm getting back to my question of -- This benefits -- So, this $43.83 million benefits is all of the
savings to the utility. Are you adding back in, then, the fact that we have to raise prices, or cover our fixed costs, that we
weren't covering before?

2:12:35:

Vice Mayor Filseth: No. What happens ...

2:12:37:

Chair Scharff: OK.

2:12:37:

Vice Mayor Filseth: What happens is, when you reduce the amount of commodity that you consume as a homeowner --
right? -- then the fixed costs get amortized over a smaller piece of commodity. So, as an aggregate -- OK? -- As a total,
everybody's bill still goes down. OK? But if somebody else saves more -- uses less commodity than you do -- If Greg
cuts his use even further, your bill goes up. Right? But the total bill, integrated over everybody, still goes down. Because
you're using less commodity and you've got the same fixed costs.

2:13:16:

Jon Abendschein: That's accurate.

2:13:17:

Chair Scharff: Is that accurate?

2:13:17:

**: (unamplified) **.

2:13:18:

Chair Scharff: So, you actually have the same fixed costs. OK.

2:13:20:

Jon Abendschein: Right. It -- it's -- yeah, it's one ...

2:13:23:
                                                              14
Vice Mayor Filseth: What happens is, the cost of the fixed costs gets distributed unevenly, depending on who saves more
energy.

2:13:28:

Dean Batchelor: And that's the key -- is, so that it gets spread unevenly -- to the commodity.

2:13:32:

Jon Abendschein: And I think it's also important -- I mean, I understand Palo Alto is largely built out. But when you have
even small amounts of growth, you end up being able to accommodate more customers with the same infrastructure.

2:13:48:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Right. So ...

2:13:48:

Jon Abendschein: And that means that everybody's bill goes down even further, because you don't have to invest in
additional infrastructure to add on those additional customers.

2:13:55:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Right. The fixed cost gets amortized over ...

2:13:55:

Jon Abendschein: And that's what's really important around ...

2:13:58:

Chair Scharff: But that's what's really confusing ...

2:13:58:

Jon Abendschein: ... commodity fixed costs.

2:13:58:

Chair Scharff: ... **. So, the more customers we have -- right? -- the more energy usage we have -- Everyone's bill gets
lower, because we're distributing the fixed costs ...

2:14:09:

Jon Abendschein: Except that, at a certain point, you have to build additional ...

2:14:11:

Chair Scharff: Right. Assuming you don't have to build additional ...

2:14:14:

Vice Mayor Filseth: The difference in his scenario -- the one he just described -- it's not that you have more commodity
usage. It's you have more CUSTOMERS. Right? So, it's actually amortized over more CUSTOMERS, as opposed to
commodity.

2:14:28:

Chair Scharff: So, I will take it. So, what you're telling me is, the UTILITY is saving the $43.83 [million]. And this is
apples to apples. And we're spending $43.83 [million] too. OK. So, it's a break-even proposition.
                                                               15
2:14:41:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:14:43:

Chair Scharff: Depending upon the sensitivity of the [$]14 [million] minus to the [$]8 [million] plus. OK. And your best
estimate load is that it breaks even, on the different risk levels.

2:14:54:

Shiva Swaminathan: And it's -- And it's highly sensitive to three things. The operational costs and operational savings
we're able to get, and the conservation. Capital cost is ...

2:15:05:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Sure. Whether it's 1 or 2 percent makes a big difference there.

2:15:08:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yup. Yup. Yup.

2:15:10:

Dean Batchelor: But I think, though, that the thing is that the key is around -- you know, it's the workforce piece -- that
there's savings in that workforce, and how it gains efficiencies -- which is that largest piece right there.

2:15:24:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) But his (amplified) his 1 or 2 percent average saving on your customer saves as much
as all the workforce costs.

2:15:33:

Dean Batchelor: Yes.

2:15:34:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK?

2:15:34:

Dean Batchelor: Yup.

2:15:35:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Pretty sensitive.

2:15:36:

**: Yup.

2:15:36:

Shiva Swaminathan: Very sensitive.

2:15:39:

Council Member Tanaka: (unamplified) So, I have a question **.


                                                              16
2:15:40:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um hum.

2:15:41:

Council Member Tanaka: So, -- So, on that big blue part, the meter reading.

2:15:46:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um hum.

2:15:46:

Council Member Tanaka: So, the City employees are now reading that?

2:15:49:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:15:50:

Council Member Tanaka: OK. So, what happens to them? I mean, so -- I mean -- because it's really hard to get rid of
any employees. Right? So, ...

2:15:56:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right. So -- A couple of things. So, we've been talking about this for the last five years. And so
there has been uncertainty around that workforce. So, we've kept them up-to-date. And we're going to brief them again
after today's meeting. So, it's an entry-level position. And so, many folks find other positions within the utility. It is an
entry-level position.

2:16:18:

Council Member Tanaka: Uh huh.

2:16:18:

Shiva Swaminathan: So, ...

2:16:19:

Council Member Tanaka: I just want to make sure it's like real savings. Because if you can't fire anyone, then ...

2:16:25:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. But ...

2:16:25:

Council Member Tanaka: ... you're not going to save any money.

2:16:26:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes, it is real savings.

2:16:28:

Dean Batchelor: So, in this case, is -- it's real savings. So, we've -- like Shiva just mentioned, is that we've had
conversations with our meter-reading group as a whole. And if this moves forward, a portion of it is that those nine
positions that are there now, for the meter readers, will go away. Physically go away.
                                                              17
### Who reads the meters of the customers who opt not to have smart meters?

2:16:44:

Council Member Tanaka: And what happens to those employees?

2:16:45:

Dean Batchelor: As Shiva mentioned, is that they can be retrained. I mean, as probably all of you know, we have MANY
opportunities in utilities. We have -- right now, we have TONS of openings. So, they can be retrained, repurposed. And
so, they won't -- possibly -- lose their JOBS. But -- We'll capture the savings off that salary. But they'll move into open
positions. And we'll train them.

2:17:07:

Council Member Tanaka: But are people really -- Because I think we're really going to get a -- There's an opening for
the head of the utilities. Right? But could a meter reader really become the head of utilities? Probably not. So I'm just
wondering how transferrable ...

2:17:16:

Dean Batchelor: No, I -- I think the thing is that, you know, we do have openings on the electric side. You know, we have
openings in our electric meter shop, where there are apprenticeships -- positions, where somebody that can come -- that,
right now, anybody can come off the street and become one of those folks.

2:17:31:

Council Member Tanaka: I just want to make sure that's true.

2:17:32:

Dean Batchelor: You know, that's -- that's definitely true.

2:17:33:

Council Member Tanaka: OK. OK. And then, the second thing is, for the -- for all the operational expense that is $27
million, ...

2:17:43:

Dean Batchelor: Um hum.

2:17:43:

Council Member Tanaka: ... does that -- or, I guess, really, the staff -- why wouldn't it say staff on there ...

2:17:45:

Dean Batchelor: Correct.

2:17:46:

Council Member Tanaka: ... does that really have to be -- Is that City employees, or is this contractors?

2:17:50:

Shiva Swaminathan: So, the current thought is, on meter-reading side, we have ...

2:17:54:


                                                               18
Council Member Tanaka: No, no. I'm talking about ...

2:17:55:

Shiva Swaminathan: No, I'm trying to compare numbers. So, on the meter-reading side, about 7-8 staff reduction. And
about 4 additional -- staff increase, on the right-hand side, what you said. Of which 4 are -- Four additional positions, of
which one could potentially be outsourced with a central service provider. But we'll need a minimum of about three
internal. So, current assumption is -- to the left side -- four additional positions, one of which could be a contracted
position. For a central service provider -- to the right. We have about 6-7 meter-reading positions eliminated.

2:18:33:

Council Member Tanaka: OK. So, you know -- I'm just looking at the size of the bar. I mean, those three staff ones are
bigger than the big blue one.

2:18:40:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes.

2:18:40:

Council Member Tanaka: And so, it's like four really expensive people replacing nine cheap people. Is that what's
happening?

2:18:46:

Shiva Swaminathan: That's part of it. But part -- the bottom of the bucket is -- these two are not people. Just these three
are people.

2:18:52:

Council Member Tanaka: Oh, I know. I'm talking about that ...

2:18:53:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yeah. So the -- $19 million versus $16 million. Correct.

2:18:56:

Council Member Tanaka: Well, um, you would think that this would like eliminate the need for people. But ...

2:19:06:

Shiva Swaminathan: It does people, but not the cost. People's cost. Because it -- entry-level position versus more
trained and skilled positions.

2:19:14:

Council Member Tanaka: And so, why did you need like -- I'm just trying to understand this, because right now, we don't
have those people on that side, right? I mean, we just have people going out there reading the meter.

2:19:22:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um hum.

2:19:22:

Council Member Tanaka: Theoretically, this should all be automatic now, right? All the numbers should just go into the
SAP, and generate the bills, right? So, why, suddenly, do we need to have $19 million on the other side? Because we
didn't have them before. So, like ...


                                                              19
2:19:36:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right. Yeah. Well, that's a good question. So, the four positions we think about are kind of in the
following areas. One is, kind of -- there's a network. Which -- we have to maintain the health of the network. So,
that position is called AMI administrator ...

2:19:50:

Council Member Tanaka: Oh, I see.

2:19:51:

Shiva Swaminathan: ... so, looking at the network. That is a position that we can potentially outsource. That function has
to take place. But there are vendors who provide that. So, the cost-wise, we are talking to some ** which potentially
could do that. So that's first. The other is, all this data which comes in, there's a data analyst position.

2:20:10:

Council Member Tanaka: Why do you need that? We don't have it now. We have all this data coming in, too. But ...

2:20:13:

Shiva Swaminathan: No, but not in the granular ** ...

2:20 15:

Council Member Tanaka: But what I was saying -- I was -- I mean, that's kind of like -- you know, that's -- Personally, I'd
love to see this happen. But, I mean, right now, the economics are marginal, right? But because you want -- I mean, it
looks like the extra data person is more of a nice-to-have. Because if we don't have -- We don't -- Just because -- We
don't necessarily have to have -- I mean, why do we have to have this?

2:20:34:

Shiva Swaminathan: To get the value of customer engagement.

2:20:38:

Council Member Tanaka: Oh, I see. So, you couldn't do the other ones if you don't have this person.

2:20:40:

Shiva Swaminathan: Exactly.

2:20:40:

Council Member Tanaka: OK. OK.

2:20:41:

Shiva Swaminathan: Exactly right. And ...

2:20:41:

Jon Abendschein: (unamplified) All systems need tending. I mean, this is a whole extra system.

2:20:45:

Council Member Tanaka: And we can't outsource this? We can't outsource those four people. So, instead of having to
have like expensive union City employees, we can't have like vendors taking care of this for us?

2:20:54:
                                                             20
Shiva Swaminathan: Certain functions, yes. But, as I said, one function we've identified as a potential ...

2:21:00:

Council Member Tanaka: And the other three, no way?

2:21:01:

 Shiva Swaminathan: And other -- others are harder to do. We have to still maintain -- For example, that outage -- we
still have to go and replace the radio. So, we -- still requires maintenance.

2:21:10:

Council Member Tanaka: OK. And the last question, which is, on the right-hand side, what if we do dynamic
pricing? How does that change the -- dynamic pricing?

### "Dynamic pricing" sometimes means that the price can change from moment to moment in response to the market.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pricing
I think Council Member Tanaka wants to ask about time-of-use pricing, where the rates are known well in advance of
when the electricity is consumed, but could be different for different times of day, or different times of year.

2:21:18:

Shiva Swaminathan: How would that change?

2:21:19:

Council Member Tanaka: Yeah. How would that -- would that make the right side bigger. I mean, like, if we -- if we were
to ...

2:21:25:

Shiva Swaminathan: ** right side bigger. Yes. And that's something that we have not quantified.

2:21:29:

Council Member Tanaka: OK.

2:21:30:

Shiva Swaminathan: And that's -- so, that's the time-of-use pricing?

2:21:33:

Council Member Tanaka: Yeah. Time-of-use pricing.

2:21:34:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. So, that's expected to save, for two reasons. One, it will reduce our costs, to extend
customer changes behavior, ...

2:21:40:

Council Member Tanaka: Um hum.

2:21:40:

Shiva Swaminathan: ... and the other is, we can use the customer's electric vehicle and storage system to better
maximize ...


                                                             21
2:21:46:

Council Member Tanaka: Yup.

2:21:

Shiva Swaminathan: Those two customer streams are harder to quantify. It is there. It is big.

2:21:52:

Council Member Tanaka: Well, I guess I'm just trying to see -- because I ...

2:21:54:

Shiva Swaminathan: Grow the pies.

2:21:55:

Council Member Tanaka: Well, how can I -- how to make this pencil out? Because right now, it's ...

2:21:59:

Shiva Swaminathan: Good question.

2:22:00:

Council Member Tanaka: ... it's marginal. Right?

2:22:02:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right now, it's -- So, we are going to go through slides which we have not quantified. And that's
one of those. And perhaps comes in a short ...

2:22:08:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Can I ask a question on that, that sort of is -- that Greg has just brought up? Which is, if I charge my
electric car in the middle of the afternoon, as opposed to at night, does it save the City money?

2:22:18:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes.

2:22:19:

Council Member Tanaka: (unamplified) That's what I was trying to get to, right? ...

2:22:20:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK. So, time-of-use helps. OK.

2:22:22:

Council Member Tanaka: (unamplified) So it should pencil out, right? ...

2:22:22:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yup. And that was not true five years ago.

2:22:25:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) Sure. It's 'cause of the solar.
                                                             22
2:22:30:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yup. Exactly the point. So, that saving, of sending the price signal and the customer changing, is
not here. And -- because that's not a conservation saving. That's a time-of-use pricing -- the ability to send that pricing
signal.

2:22:42:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) So, the ...

2:22:43:

Shiva Swaminathan: And that's huge.

2:22:44:

**: (unamplified) **

2:22:45:

[laughter]

2:22:46:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yup. Yup.

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) So, the other question is -- is that -- as we implement this, this shows other -- so, is this going
to -- how's this going to impact rates? I mean, are we going to have to basically say, a lot of the savings come in the
back end, so now we have to raise rates -- You know, if it's $18 million, do we have to raise rates, you know, 15 percent?

2:23:09:

Shiva Swaminathan: OK. So, two things, in answer to that. If you're going to finance that over the 18-year term of the
project, there is no front end. So, we have -- The Calaveras Fund can be used only for electric. So we can use
that. And that would -- if we use it -- and then there would no -- not impact on rates on electric. On the gas one, it has to
be an arms-length loan -- at -- and then that will be spread over 18 years.

2:23:34:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) We don't need to loan it from the Calaveras Fund to the electric. We could just spend it. And
then there's no effects on the electric.

2:23:40:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. Correct. But this assumes that that money is still real money, and -- So, this kind of ...

2:23:48:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) **.

2:23:49:

Shiva Swaminathan: So, this assumes -- doesn't assume the fin- -- it just assumes both are financed over an 18 year
period.

2:23:57:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) So, the reality ...

2:23:57:
                                                               23
Jon Abendschein: ** financing, it will be better than what you're seeing there.

2:24:01:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:24:02:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) So, the reality, though, is that if we just spend the money out of the Calaveras Fund for the
electric, the electric rates should actually go down, because ...

2:24:10:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:24:10:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) ... **. That's actually an important thing. So, the customer will see we got better service and
rates went down.

2:24:16:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yup.

### No. Bills might go down for the customers who conserve, but rates won't go down (as Shiva explains next).

2:24:21:

So, this is what shows. So, assuming that it's going to be financed -- not using reserves -- over 18-year term, what you
see in green is the expected impact on customer BILLS, not rates. Bills. As -- Because consumption is going to go
down, rates are likely to go up, because -- spread over a smaller unit of -- So, rates are likely to go up. But the
consumption is down, so the bill impact is what you see in green. And then we ran ...

2:24:50:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) So, when you do your billing -- doing your crazy -- the average customer bill in Palo Alto is
$49.

### Just for electric?

Is that the -- Is that the ...

2:24:58:

Shiva Swaminathan: No. We looked at cash flows for the -- for the -- so, that is a residential customer -- this is not a cash
flow for the utility. So, the same, utility-wide. And so, we ran two scenarios. What if -- Adverse outcome. Forty percent
higher operating costs. For whatever reason. We have more staff having to do this. And then, ten percent on capital
costs. The capital costs are known with relative certainty. And then the savings. Fifty percent lower operating
savings. And 100 percent of the conservation is not there. The rate impact is in the 1 to 2 percent range. And then, on
the other side, it's about half a percent. Negative half a percent. And if you include -- we had another chart with the
Calaveras Reserve, it's even lower. If we use the Calaveras Reserve.

2:24:56:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) So, if (amplified) I understand what you just said on the previous one, -- I mean, ...

2:26:01:

Shiva Swaminathan: Previous one?


                                                             24
2:26:02:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Yeah. Well, no, no, that one. That one.

2:26:03:

Shiva Swaminathan: OK.

2:26:03:

Vice Mayor Filseth. Yeah. So, your 50 percent lower operating costs is 100 percent of the conservation savings. That
seems like a pretty worse case to me. OK? It means you're not going to save that much on the operating costs, and you
get no savings at all on the conservation, which is, you know, a big chunk of -- ...

2:26:16:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yup.

2:26:16:

Vice Mayor Filseth: ... big chunk **. And even in that case, you're looking at a two percent increase in bills.

2:26:21:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yup.

2:26:22:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Not that much. OK.

2:26:25:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) And if you don't finance out of the Calaveras for the electric utility, do you remember what it
looks like? If you just pay ...

2:26:33:

**: Microphone, Greg.

2:26:33:

Chair Scharff: Sorry. If you just use the Fund?

2:26:35:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um. We looked at it last year. Initialed -- again, depending on how we spread the cash flow. So, if
you say, over five years. So, it will be an increase in the initial term and then less pressure in the outer years. We haven't
run that numbers in detail.

2:26:51:

Chair Scharff: Why -- why -- We have -- what -- $40 million in the Calaveras Fund? Or ...

2:26:54:

Shiva Swaminathan: We have $50 million ...

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:26:58:

Chair Scharff: So, if you just spent $18 million out of it, ...

2:27:02:

Shiva Swaminathan: Out of the Calaveras Reserve?

2:27:03:

Chair Scharff: Yeah. For the -- Just for the electric utility.

2:27:06:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right.

2:27:06:

Chair Scharff: Because you can't do it -- I mean ...

2:27:07:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right.

2:27:07:

Chair Scharff: And you're not borrowing the money. So there's no borrowing costs.

2:27:10:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right.

2:27:10:

Chair Scharff: You're just spending it.

2:27:12:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:27:12:

Chair Scharff: So, is -- does that assume borrowing costs or not?

2:27:16:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes. Oh. This assume borrowing costs.


                                                                  26
2:27:17:

Chair Scharff: Even for the electric.

2:27:18:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yes.

2:27:18:

Chair Scharff: What I'm asking is, if you ran the electric fund with no borrowing costs.

2:27:22:

Shiva Swaminathan: Oh. Got it.

2:27:22:

Chair Scharff: Because I don't understand why we would pay the Calaveras Fund back. That makes no sense.

2:27:25:

Shiva Swaminathan: No. No.

2:27:25:

Chair Scharff: We just spend the money. So, there will be no borrowing costs for the electric.

2:27:29:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:27:29:

Chair Scharff: There would be for water. And there would be for gas.

2:27:31:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:27:31:

Chair Scharff: So, what does it look like ...

2:27:33:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct.

2:27:33:

Chair Scharff: I'm trying to get a sense of what actually happens.

2:27:35:

Shiva Swaminathan: Ah. It's about a 1.5 percent decrease. Here, on the electric.

2:27:40:

Chair Scharff: A 1.5 percent increase.

2:27:41:
                                                             27

[multiple speakers]

2:27:43:

Dean Batchelor: (unamplified) On the Calaveras. That's correct.

2:27:47:

Chair Scharff: So, I'm confused. It can't be that way. 'Cause that would be higher than your worst case. If you borrowed.

2:27:54:

Shiva Swaminathan: I need to think. It's somewhere in the 1 percent range -- 1 to 1.5 percent range. We did do some
numbers. I ...

2:28:01:

Chair Scharff: But how can that be? Because, right now, if you borrow the money, from what I understood, you're at a
half percent on the good case, which is the green. Right? And on the bad case, you're at 1 percent.

2:28:10:

Shiva Swaminathan: I'm talking about this number only. So, this is break-even.

2:28:13:

Chair Scharff: All right. I thought it was -- Yeah. OK. So, that's break-even.

1:28:15:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right.

2:28:16:

Chair Scharff: So -- So, it's got -- So, it should be less.

2:28:19:

2:28:36:

Jon Abendschein: The second one. **

[Hard to transcribe]

2:28:40:

Vice Mayor Filseth: ... as opposed to 1 percent of whatever that is.

2:28:41:

Shiva Swaminathan: Oh, no, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:28:42:

Chair Scharff: So, we can have -- People can see a 1 percent savings on their electric bill. Which is ...

2:28:49:

Vice Mayor Filseth: It wouldn't suck.

2:28:50:

Chair Scharff: No. That's what I mean. That's not bad at all.

2:28:54:

Council Member Kou: (unamplified) I'm sorry.

2:28:55:

Chair Scharff: Yes.

2:28:55:

Council Member Kou: Can you explain again to me that green dot? You said that the green dot is not the rate.

2:29:00:

2:29:00:

Council Member Kou: It's the ...

2:29:01:

Shiva Swaminathan: Bill.

2:29:03:

Council Member Kou: The bill.

2:29:03:

Shiva Swaminathan: Right. So, the bill ...

2:29:04:

Council Member Kou: So, the bill actually goes down.

2:29:07

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. So, this assumes that the capital has to be repaid. The green assumes that the capital of
electric has to be repaid over the life of the project -- the $10 million. And -- But if you have to pay it off with your -- pay it
off up-front, without having to repay, then the bill impact is -- it reduces your bill.

2:29:33:

Council Member Kou: And this is ...

2:29:34:

Shiva Swaminathan: I think I answered that question.

2:29:35:

Council Member Kou: Yeah. I kind of get it now. But this is on both commercial and residential, right?

2:29:40:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. Correct. OK?

Um. So, these were the benefits quantified, which we just talked about:
* Meter-reading cost reduction.
* Meter reader injuries. Quantified that.

### This particular item wasn't specifically talked about.

* Better customer service.
* Energy / water conservation.
* Reduce water leaks. And
* Conservation voltage reduction.

2:30:06:

These are the benefits which were harder to quantify. We could have taken a stab at it, but we didn't want to. We wanted
to just lay it out there.


                                                                30
* Improved customer experience. We have 300 customers on a wait list wanting this. And commercial customers wanting
this information.
* Maintain reliability. So, it's both better restoration if there's outage. We can know ahead of time -- as soon as it
happened, without a call coming through. We can detect it and respond to it sooner. And also, preventive
maintenance. We have visibility into our distribution system. That's number two.

2:30:43:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) How about visibility into EVs?

2:30:45:

Shiva Swaminathan: On the EVs. That's coming down.

2:30:48:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) Gotcha.

2:30:49:

Shiva Swaminathan:
* Enhanced safety. So, water / gas leak detection. We have all the information if there is a continuous flow of gas. There
are certain threshold industry uses to alert customers. That's safety.
* Time-of-use retail rates. That's what we talked about. The ability to shift. And, as a result, the utility also saves.
* Improved ...

2:31:12:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Hey, quick question on that. Sorry. Keep interrupting here. Time-of-use retail rates.

2:31:15:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um hum.

2:31:15:

Vice Mayor Filseth: How much different are they? Is it like 5 percent difference? Or 50 percent difference?

2:31:20:

Shiva Swaminathan: So ...

2:31:22:

Vice Mayor Fliseth: Do you anticipate ...

2:31:22:

Shiva Swaminathan: So, the current time-of-use is about 20 percent reduction ...

2:31:27:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK.

2:31:27:

Shiva Swaminathan: ... night versus daytime.

2:31:28:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK. Yeah.
                                                            31
2:31:29:

Shiva Swaminathan: Um. But that was implemented as part of the pilot five years ago.

### This City web page (last updated 11-25-13) gives the time-of-use (TOU) rates for the smart meter pilot.
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=2466&TargetID=224,257
It refers to this updated (01-01-15) E1-TOU rate schedule.
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/32678
Note that these rates charge MORE for electricity during the day than at night. I seem to recall that, years ago, staff was
saying that TOU rates had to be based on the City's actual costs. Well, if electricity today costs more at night than during
the day, and costs most between 5:00 pm and 10:00 pm (see 2:32:06), shouldn't the pilot's TOU rates reflect that?

### If the City decides to change the pilot's TOU rates, I hope someone will pay attention to how that alters
customer behavior. The pilot's customers will have some bad habits to break.

### If electricity still costs the City more during the day than at night, but there's reason to believe that in the future it
would cost more at night than during the day, could the City decide to charge TOU rates to pilot customers based on what
it expects its costs to be in the future, to find out what customers would do in the future?

### This 12-11-17 article say San Diego Gas & Electric has changed its TOU rates, so that the peak rate occurs later in
the day, but electricity still costs less at night than during the day.
https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-time-of-use-commercial-customers-solar-pv#gs.UlqYg1g

Now, you can see the energy prices -- the last year, on average -- during the solar hours, versus ...

2:31:42:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Right. Right.

2:31:42:

Shiva Swaminathan: ... the evening is -- the early evening is double that of solar hours. The market price.

### For what fraction of the electricity consumed during the "early evening" is the City paying the "market price," rather
than a price based on long-term contracts? (Or is that even a good question to ask, given that energy conserved will be
at the marginal -- market -- price?)

### This 07-25-18 article reports the California Independent System Operator average hourly day-ahead price for
electricity -- a January-through-June average -- for 2015, 2016, and 2017.
https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/eia-charts-californias-real-and-growing-duck-curve#gs.ZtDDutQ

2:31:49:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK. How about the middle of the night?

2:31:51:

Shiva Swaminathan: Middle of the night, it's back down.

2:31:52:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK. So, the difference between solar hours and middle of the night is 20 percent, or something like
that?

2:31:58:

Council Member Tanaka: (unamplified) He said double.

2:32:00:


                                                              32
Vice Mayor Filseth: He said ...

2:32:00:

Shiva Swaminathan: It's about the same ...

2:32:03:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Oh. It's about the SAME.

2:32:04:

Shiva Swaminathan: Or slightly -- maybe 10 percent higher.

2:32:05:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK.

### Could Council ask staff to write a staff report documenting where electricity comes from (hydro, solar, wind, market),
as a function of time of day, for summer and winter, and weekday versus weekend, and also what the City pays for it?

### In principle, the cost to the provider of hydroelectric power should be independent of time of day. (Right?) Is that
how our hydro contracts are priced? Are we choosing to take our hydro power in the "early evening"?

2:32:06:

Shiva Swaminathan: But the key is between ...

2:32:09:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK.

2:32:09:

Shiva Swaminathan: ... five and ...

2:32:10:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK. Right.

2:32:10:

Shiva Swaminathan: ... ten o'clock.

2:32:11:

Vice Mayor Filseth: OK.

2:32:11:

Shiva Swaminathan: It's double then -- that of solar hours. And that savings we can pass on. Can achieve it, and pass it
on to customers.

2:32:20:

OK.

### Shiva gets back to itemizing non-quantified benefits (started at 2:30:06).

* Reduced workman's compensation.


                                                             33
### Is the workman's compensation for meter readers unusually high?

* Cost sharing. So, the water district is actively -- wants custom- -- us to do this. Santa Clara Valley Water District is
thinking of a program to incentivize custom- -- utilities to do this for their customers. And then,
* Solar PV adoption.
* And so on.

2:32:40:

Chair Sharff: Any -- Are they going to pay for any of this -- Santa Clara Valley Water District?

2:32:42:

Shiva Swaminathan: Potentially, yes. They are going to pay for something. We don't exactly know what. But they want
their customers to do this.

2:32:51:

Um. So, sources of funding. So, our recommended one is number two and three.
* Electric Special Project Reserve [ESP].

### A.k.a. Calaveras Fund.

And then,
* a loan from the Electric Special Project Reserve to the gas and water fund, over an 18-year term, at an arms-length
interest rate.
And then, that will be recovered through retail rates.

2:33:17:

We also are cognizant that there are a number of other technology projects going on. Jonathan Reichental's group.
* SAP -- a financial system.
* ERP -- our customer billing system.
are in the process of being upgraded. And this is related to the
* CIS system. To actually get the time-of-use rates going, it has to tie to the customer information system. So, it is
sequenced. So even if Council just approve it today, conceptually, the actual implementation is not likely to happen --
COMPLETION is not going to happen for five years from now. So, we just need to be cognizant of that.

### Generally, how flexible will this software be? After it's written, what if someone thinks of a new application that wants
the functionality to be a bit different?

2:33:54:

And there is -- it's a big staffing commitment. CIS requires implement over 2-3 years. We need temporary staff, back-
fills, consultants, and so on. It's a large effort, and it has to be sequenced and planned, to make sure that we are
successful.

2:34:10:

So, in terms of next steps, after the Finance Committee consideration, if the recommendation is to go forward, we go to
the Council in December. And then we'll wait 'til the CIS and ERP timelines are finalized in the summer. That's
coordination with Jonathan Reichental on the -- on that system. Based on that outcome. We'll come back to the Finan- --
UAC and Finance in the fall of 2019, of a detailed implementation plan. And full deployment, if everything goes well, is in
the 2022-2023 timeline. Five years away. But it's a long-lead project. So, the request today is to recommend Council to
accept the plan.

2:35:00:

Chair Scharff: And, Commissioner Schwartz, would you like to come and speak to us about what the UAC's take on this
was?


                                                              34
2:35:12:

Commissioner Schwartz: I had hoped for a more collegial exchange, rather than just sort of a short little
presentation. Because -- two things. One, because the UAC has spent a lot of time talking about this. And it's not
something that can just be shared in a couple of minutes. And the other thing is that this is the area that I work in for my
day job.

### Why isn't it a conflict of interest -- or at least the appearance of a conflict of interest? Recall that Commissioners
Amari and Hall recused themselves on water-related items, because their day jobs were working for other water utilities.

And I'm one of the nationally-recognized experts on customer engagement and help and adoption of smart grid. And how
people -- So, I know an awful lot about best practices, and where are things that we can either do this as a giant mess, or
we can have people be really happy. And I think that unless we have an open opportunity to really talk to the City Council
about what works and what doesn't work, you can very easily give direction to staff, or to do things that are -- could be
really problematic. And so, what is the right process for this? I don't know. We'll have to come back to that ...

2:36:12:

Chair Scharff: So, the appropriate process ...

2:36:13:

Commissioner Schwartz: Pardon?

2:36:14:

Chair Scharff: The appropriate process for this is for you to tell us what the UAC thought. And if you wish to speak as an
individual, on your own PRIVATE view of things, then you'd be happy to have three minutes. But you're actually here as
the UAC ...

2:36:27:

Commissioner Schwartz: I understand that. But we've been talking about this at the UAC.

2:36:30:

Chair Scharff: So, a summary of what the UAC ...

2:36:33:

Commissioner Schwartz: Well, ...

2:36:33:

Chair Scharff: ... has to say on this. I mean, that's the purpose ...

2:36:36:

Commissioner Schwartz: OK, ...

2:36:36:

Chair Scharff: ... of coming tonight is to hear the UAC representative ...

2:36:40:

Commissioner Schwartz: Right.

2:36:40:

Chair Scharff: ... of the UAC. What was their thoughts, recommendations?
                                                               35
2:36:43:

Commissioner Schwartz: So, what we have been talking about is, one of the benefits of doing AMI and other smart grid
kinds of activities are the variability that you're allowed to give to different people in the community. So, what is the trigger
for someone to change their behavior, because they're going to either -- you have an incentive as a utility to want to have
more usage at a certain time of day, versus less usage at a different time of day. So, one of the issues that got brought
up is, some people are going to be motivated by -- is it the right thing to do for carbon? So, when you plug in your electric
vehicle at noon, you're using up solar electrons. And so, they may be motivated to do it then, whether the price is more or
less. That's a different thing. Other people are completely motivated by price. And so, you want to give them a price
trigger, to get them to do what you want. OK? And I think that what we're not -- what didn't come up today in the
conversation is that these -- these -- taking advantage of what people have cared about, and what has proven in
jurisdiction after jurisdiction. 'Cause we are late to the party on that. And this is one of the things that I think the UAC has
come to realize, is that Palo Alto is not on the leading edge of this. We are a late adopter. OK? And so, there are a lot of
lessons that we can take from other communities. OK?

2:38:19:

So, one of the things that has come up is the idea of proactive maintenance. So, one of the things that utilities have found
they learned, from the data that they get, and being able to analyze all the usages available -- that they understand that if
they fix a transformer, oh, it looks like it's about to fail over there, they can get it out, and they can get it fixed, so that
people don't go down, and don't have a loss of service. So, one of the reasons why you have happier customers is
because you have better outage detection, you can communicate effectively with people when it's going to be back
up. Right now, our system is very antiquated. And we can't do a good job at all. You can look at things on a house-by-
house basis. So you can understand exactly, and pinpoint where the outages are. So the crews can go more specifically
to where they need to be. So, one of the cost savings that happens operationally is because you are -- you are going to
precisely the right point. And, again, sometimes you can even catch it before. And, again, we have a lot of lessons
learned, throughout the state, because -- you know, we're one of the last few utilities to do this. It's like having -- wanting
to have Internet and not wanting to put a router in.

### I don't get this analogy. In an Ethernet network, a router is a thing that figures out where switches should forward the
packets they receive, based on the packets' IP addresses. The functionality of a router has to exist somewhere in the
network, but it doesn't have to exist in the equipment at every home that wants to have Internet service. Perhaps
Commissioner Schwartz is talking about the thing in a home that uses Wi-Fi to connect the home's wired network port to
one or more portable computers in the home. If so, I don't think that thing is "foundational." There's no reason a portable
computer can't use a wire to connect to the wired network.

You know. We're -- You -- When you have -- this is technology, that, as Shiva talked about, it's now really foundational
technology.

2:39:34:

Another thing we talked about at the UAC is the concept of rate design, and rates as incentives. So, right now, it doesn't
matter, in Palo Alto, when you use your electricity. It's the same thing -- OK, there's some minor tiers. But one of the
things you can do with rate design is, you can help push the system to be what you want it to be. OK? And so, we can't -
- So, right now, everybody has to be on the same rate.

### Businesses and residences aren't on the same rate.

Another thing that we've talked about has to do with the idea of conservation. So the average -- Right now, everybody
who conserves has to do it completely voluntarily. They have no information. They have no feedback. They have no
idea whether they've done a good job 'til the end of the month.

### The monthly bill IS feedback.

There's nothing that's anything close to current or real time. So, one of the things that has come up in a lot of places is,
they've done something like prepay, which is really good for places that have a lot of students and people who are in
rental housing. That if they know that they've put money into an account, and they're -- it's basically, they're working off
their own money, then you get -- you get conservation rates that are in the 14 to 17 percent area.

### I don't understand. Why isn't it the customer's own money whether it's prepaid or billed?
                                                               36
So you can really do things that are a lot more nuanced. OK? Because you can give people choices of the kinds of
programs that are of greatest interest to them. And so that's been one of the points that the UAC has been discussing
over the last year, not just in one session.

2:41:23:

But we've been -- we've been talking a lot about the idea of coincident versus non-coincident demand. So, when the
generation hits and when you're using it -- OK -- is not necessarily the same thing. So, you guys talked about storage
earlier. You know, the way storage works, the scale that you do storage with, the way you give people incentives. Are
you asking people to invest in their own business, to -- to do storage, versus you do something on a utility scale? So,
these are complicated issues that take more than just a couple of seconds to discuss.

2:42:04:

Another thing that we've talked about is the idea of estimates -- estimating your bill versus really more accurately
knowing. So, one of the things that AMI has done a lot of is that, instead of just guessing how much somebody used, you
actually know. And so, they found out that in a lot of -- particularly -- places with older meters, you have meters that were
running slow. OK? And, all of a sudden, you have -- more accurate, and you found somebody's been using more
electricity than you thought they were. Now, what do you do with that?

### How do you know which meter is more accurate?

Do you just give somebody a higher bill? OR, do you do something like San Diego Gas & Electric did, where you -- you
write a report, find out who's way out of whack, you proactively go talk to them, and you -- And you say, you know, we
have not been charging you for all the electricity that you have been using, and -- because you had a slow meter. But
now it's going to be accurate. So, somebody's bill might go up. But if you handle this in the right way, they're not going to
be mad, because you're not going to back-charge them for all the stuff they didn't pay for.

2:43:07:

So, that's just one example of something that we've discussed. Another thing has to do with opting out. OK? So, that
has come up several times. And one of the best practices is that -- starting the project right at the beginning. Know that
you're going to have an opt-out policy, that if somebody doesn't want a smart meter, it's OK. Just tell them what it's going
to cost to still have a meter reader come and check their place. OK?

### I agree that the City should have an opt-out policy. I don't agree that there should be just one opt-out option.

### In this TEDx talk, Jeromy Johnson describes (at 3:00) how he found out that smart meters can cause health effects.
https://www.emfanalysis.com/tedx-wireless-wake-up-call/
He speculates (at 12:48) that if smart meters were connected via fiber, or were designed to transmit just once or twice per
day, they'd be safe.

That is another example of something we've discussed, that is a practice that they've dealt with in other jurisdictions, that
if we have an open dialogue about how this stuff works, then we'll have a positive experience for the community. OK?

2:43:59:

And -- I'm just trying to think if there's something -- You know, there's -- There's just a lot of material that's out there,
that's already been developed that we can learn from. And I just think that it will be really useful for us to know what is the
way that we, as the UAC, need to share the information with you, to be able to do it? Do we have to write a colleagues'
memo? So that we can get at more of the detail of this?

### Recall that Commissioner Schwartz hijacked the Commissioner Comments portion of the 11-04-15 UAC meeting to
deliver a 20-minute tirade in opposition to municipal FTTP. It was allegedly based on a draft a colleagues memo, but no
actual colleagues memo ever materialized. Chair Foster said he received guidance from the "City Council's office and
Ms. Mullan" (from the City Attorney's office) before allowing this hijacking. UAC Liaison Scharff was absent. (See a
transcript and my comments here, pages 24-35.)
https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/49931



                                                              37
As far as I know, Council never censured anyone for it. But it should be obvious that, in a meeting of a deliberative body
like UAC, it should not be OK to just give a commissioner 20 minutes to advocate a point of view on a topic that hasn't
been agendized and then forbid the other commissioners to weigh in.

We had hoped that there would be more of an opportunity to discuss things at the joint meeting that we had earlier
year. But it really -- we really didn't cover -- you know, didn't have time to cover that much.

### I think the joint meeting between Council and UAC should be an opportunity to discuss things like whether the UAC
has the resources to do its job. For example, UAC used to have verbatim minutes, but now they have sense minutes
written by staff. So UAC's advice is filtered through staff. UAC doesn't get to decide what the agenda items of its
meetings are, or whether they're "action" items.

So, these are complicated issues. And so, you know, I think you need to tell us what you're willing to do, to be able to be
educated on these things. Because we don't have the statutory authority. You do. And so, we can do -- have all the
discussions in the world, and have a great conversation, and know what the issues are. And if it doesn't get passed over
to you in some meaningful way, then you can make a decision that can just shoot staff in the foot, and -- or shoot the
community in the foot. So, you know, I think that's the question that I'd like to ask you -- is, what's the way that we can
have the exchange, so we can get at some of these subtleties?

2:49:29:

Chair Scharff: (unamplified) Well, I think that the typical way is that staff listens to what the UAC says (amplified) and
then goes ahead and puts those -- and distills it, and puts it in a staff report, and says, "The UAC thought this."

### It would be folly to rely only on these distillations.

That's typically the staff reports I get. Or, the UAC voted to do this, but staff doesn't recommend it. Or, the UAC made a
motion to do this, but staff fully supports that. So, normally, what happens is, your conduit is through staff.

### That's a bad idea. Part of UAC's job is to watch what staff is doing and to let Council know when what staff is doing
is a problem. It makes no sense to give staff the power to censor UAC's observations.

And, frankly, to be able to come here and give us your take on it, as the UAC.

### In my opinion, Commissioner Schwartz has been presenting Commissioner Schwartz's take on it.

That is typically the way it works. And what I'm hearing you say is, you believe this to be different than all other UAC
issues that you deal with.

2:46:11:

Commissioner Schwartz: I think the -- the -- Based on what I have seen in other places in the country, I think if -- that it is
not a five-minute conversation. OK? And that this is a -- It's complicated, with a lot of interdependencies. Because it is
where everything that the staff does in the background meets the public.

2:46:40:

Chair Scharff: So, ** ...

2:46:40:

Commissioner Schwartz: OK? It's the interface point.

2:46:42:

Chair Scharff: So, today, we're being asked to recommend that Council accept the smart grid assessment and technology
implementation plan.

2:46:48:

Commissioner Schwartz: Right. And I would encourage you to do that.
                                                              38
2:46:50:

Chair Scharff: So, I think that would be the first question I would ask the UAC. Did the UAC recommend that we accept
the smart grid assessment and technology plan?

2:46:59:

Commissioner Schwartz: Yes.

2:47:00:

Chair Scharff: OK. Was there anything in the staff report that the UAC thought should be different? Was there any
motions that said, you know, we don't like THIS part of it? I mean, that's really what we look to the UAC to do. We look to
the UAC to read the stuff -- go through it -- it's fairly long, the stuff you get -- and say, yes, we've discussed all of this. We
support this. But we don't support X. Or we think that Y should be added. That's really what we look for.

### UAC is severely out of practice in the area of expressing itself with motions. Is Chair Scharff saying that whenever
UAC considers an item that is not an action item, Council is going to ignore the result?

### UAC's current rules of order don't permit amendments, just motions and substitute motions (nested to any level). I
think it's not a best practice.

We look for a crisp and clear -- what staff is recommending. 'Cause, for the most part, we rely on staff. And it's this
discussion that the UAC has with staff. The UAC can make separate recommendations to Council -- which staff should
pass on, frankly.

### Whatever staff chooses to pass on can be distorted.

And then they come to us. It's not a discussion at Finance, or at Council, with the UAC. That's not the way it works. ** ...

2:47:53:

Commissioner Schwartz: OK. Well, when they give -- OK. So, they're pushing a lot of information at you. So, obviously,
things are put in bullet points in a short phrase. OK?

2:48:03:

Chair Scharff: And that's why it's important to have someone from the UAC come and say -- well, it's in a bullet point
phrase, but when we discussed it at the UAC, there's this nuance that I think -- or that ** ...

2:48:13:

Commissioner Schwartz: Well, that's what I was hoping to do when I wanted to speak up earlier -- was, I wanted to say,
OK, in the context of this bullet point, here's what the conversation was. And to have to keep it 'til the end is a little
trickier.

2:48:24:

Chair Scharff: Actually, that's not the role of the UAC. The UAC does NOT sit there and comment on the staff report as
we go through the staff report. That's ...

2:48:30:

Commissioner Schwartz: Well, I'm talking about when you were having a con- -- So, I've been to other Finance
Committee meetings before, where we had a chance to have a conversation. So -- They weren't necessarily ones that
you were chairing.

2:48:44:

Chair Scharff: OK, ...
                                                                39
2:48:44:

Commissioner Schwartz: So, in other circumstances -- um -- I sat at the table with everybody, and we had a conversation
about it. And so that's why I came tonight, thinking that that's what was going to happen. And if I knew I was going to do
something else, I would have prepared something differently.

2:48:59:

Chair Scharff: OK.

2:48:59:

Commissioner Schwartz: Um. But -- ah -- you know, I think there are expansions. And, here, again, you know, I think we
can't ask this staff -- who has not been through an AMI installation before -- to be able to have at their fingertips every
single thing that has come up at -- in every jurisdiction. I mean, I think that's not a realistic -- You know, I -- I'm certainly
going to do everything I can to be supportive, and to do what I can to help them do it as well as possible. But, you know, I
-- it's not -- it's not -- it's not reasonable to think that they can have every single thing in their head for something they have
yet to experience. And, you know, I just don't know how to get around that, in terms of -- But yet -- and when they give
you a summary, it's reasonable to me that they're going to give you a summary with bullet points. That can't have all the
depth that you might need to know. Because it would be, then, such a huge document, you probably wouldn't read it.

2:50:11:

Chair Scharff: Fair enough. All right. Thank you very much.

2:50:15:

Council Member Tanaka: (unamplified) Can I ask a question?

2:50:15:

Chair Scharff: Sure.

2:50:16:

Council Member Tanaka: OK. Well, first of all, thank you to UAC. And thank you for coming out here to speak with
us. So, actually, I had -- my questions for you are around -- they -- staff's talked about how the data analysis cannot be
outsourced. And I guess, given your experience, what have you seen in other municipalities, in terms of -- does -
- Because the project would actually look pretty good if we didn't have to have, you know, four expensive staff members
on this side of the chart. Right? And I guess my question to you is -- is, do we really need to have four unionized staff
members to do this? Or can this be outsourced? What have you seen in other cities?

2:50:58:

Commissioner Schwartz: So, there's a -- you see a combination of things. So, there are certain functions that you really
want to have people on staff for. There are other functions -- like when you're doing the meter installation, most -- most
utilities use a combination of their own staff and, depending on how fast they're deploying, they'll use contractors. To help
get everything done, if they're trying to do a rapid installation. A deployment. OK? To have people on staff -- We already
are so short-staffed, as a utility, that the idea that they'd want to have some people who are available and around and are
on staff who can do it, makes a lot of sense to me. Again, the detail from that chart doesn't give me exactly which jobs are
going to be ...

2:51:44:

Council Member Tanaka: No. I think -- I don't know if you were here, but ...

2:51:46:

Commissioner Schwartz: I couldn't hear everything.


                                                                40
2:51:46:

Council Member Tanaka: Oh. Can you tell me, what were the four jobs you said again?

2:51:49:

Shiva Swaminathan: Yeah. So, the one is AMI administrator. To administrate the network and the health. Data
Analyst. And then two field staff, to fix problems as they arise in the field.

2:51:58:

Commissioner Schwartz: Yeah. So, those are kind of roles that people typically have in-house. You know. It's not a ...

2:52:04:

Council Member Tanaka: ** You can't have outside vendors take care of it?

2:52:07:

Commissioner Schwartz: Well, I mean, you can have some of the things done outside. But part of -- You know, I think
part of the way utilities function is -- there's got to be people inside who know what's going on. And if everybody's a
contractor, you don't necessarily have that consistency. OK? And that ability to ...

2:52:28:

Council Member Tanaka: I get it. I mean, ...

2:52:29:

Commissioner Schwartz: Yeah.

2:52:29:

Council Member Tanaka: ... I'm more -- I'm pushing on this just because I'd like -- Personally, I'd love to see this pencil
out. But it's just -- it's so on the edge right now. And so, if this could -- if this could be outsourced, and make the project
positive, that would be a great thing. That's why I'm trying to -- It sounds like the answer's no. So, it is what it is.

2:52:49:

Commissioner Schwartz: So, there's an economic analysis that I worked on with the Brattle Group, that looked at sort of
different utility models.

### This analysis? "The Costs and Benefits of Smart Meters for Residential Customers" (July 2011)
http://www.brattle.com/news-and-knowledge/publications/archive/2011
I don't know if it's available online. Have the costs and benefits changed much since 2011?

And how do the benefits -- what are the -- sort of the economics of doing -- of doing AMI or not, and what are the
benefits. And -- pretty much in most -- in all cases, it works out to be of value. And what utilities have found -- So, there's
a project going on now called the Voices of Experience. And -- but that's part of a DoE initiative.

### This initiative?
https://www.smartgrid.gov/featured_initiatives/voice_experience_insights_smart_grid_customer_engagement.html

And what they're doing, they're looking -- they're talking to all these utilities about what have been the benefits. So, even
things that were not necessarily quantified in the initial business cases -- the benefits they're getting are proving to be so
valuable -- OK? -- that they're like -- we just wish we had known about this beforehand, so we could have put something in
the rate case to say this was going to be useful. Because they didn't -- they didn't even know how much they were going
to get from it until they actually got in the middle. And that's been a very consistent message that's come back, both from
municipal utilities, as well as investor-owned utilities.

2:54:06:
                                                               41
Council Member Tanaka: OK. Well, my second question is -- um, is -- and I'm not sure if this is just for you or for staff, or
maybe for both -- Given that we are late adopters -- And I kind of believe that, because I see -- I see smart meters on a
bunch of other cities, so I kind of think that's probably true -- You know, if we do embark on this, are we -- is it likely that
we're going to get like one bid on this project? Or would there -- You would think there'd be a ton of contractors who
have just finished a PG&E rollout. And so we would a very competitive bidding environment. I would assume.

2:54:42:

Commissioner Schwartz: Well -- But PG&E rollout has been years ago. But there certainly are plenty of active
participants in the market. So ...

2:54:49:

Council Member Tanaka: So we should get some active bidding on this project. And so, the numbers here should not
totally out of whack. We shouldn't be like -- kind of like -- oh, sorry, it's double what we need -- you know, 20 percent
contingency, or something like that. OK.


2:55:02:

Chair Schwartz: (unamplified) All right. Any other questions? Thank you very much. Um ...

2:55:07:

**: Microphone, please, Greg.

2:55:08:

Chair Schwartz: (unamplified) Oh, sorry. (amplified) All right. So, now we return to Council. And, any comments,
questions, motions?

2:55:17:

Council Member Kou: (unamplified) Question.

2:55:17:

Chair Schwartz: Go ahead.

2:55:18:

Council Member Kou: So, you know, this grid system that you have -- So, this is all going to be the -- using what --
wireless?

2:55:29:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. So, the electric meter has a radio. The gas and water will talk to the electric meter.

### As I understand it, gas and water meters will talk with some electric meter, but not necessarily with "the" electric
meter that serves the same premises.

Send their consumption information. To the electric meter. And the electric meter will talk to each other. And we'll have
about 30-50 take-out points, which will have a Verizon or AT&T cell card in it. It will take the data out.

2:55:54:

Council Member Kou: Well, I'm glad to hear you say, "Verizon or AT&T." So you're not just kind of -- only on
Verizon. You're going to explore the other carriers, right?

2:56:04:
                                                               42
Shiva Swaminathan: Yeah. Yes.

2:56:05:

Council Member Kou: But also, I -- kind of my question is -- you know, we're using the Wi-Fi system and, you know, this
kind of thing. Why are we not leveraging -- I think mostly, you know, with Jeff -- we have this question here -- why are we
not leveraging our fiber network -- you know, FTTP / FTTN -- whichever one it is?

2:56:26:

Shiva Swaminathan: We could -- we have no -- We have made a decision on that.

### Is staff saying that staff has decided not to give Council the opportunity to think about it?

So, the 50 take-out points -- they're called the ...

2:56:37:

Dean Batchelor: Gate-keeper.

2:56:37:

Shiva Swaminathan: Gate-keeper. Thank you. They're called the gate-keeper. Which is a take-out point. If there is a
suitable point -- has fiber in it -- we can use fiber to take the project out. But I think what Jeff is probably also talking about
is, for each of the 30,000 electric meters, which are at homes -- so, fiber-to-the-home -- we have no intention of using
fiber-to-the-home -- fiber at home -- to send the data from each electric meter at the home. So ...

2:57:09:

Council Member Kou: So, right now, we're -- So, there was the node. Right? There was the ...

2:57:14:

Shiva Swaminathan: Gate-keeper. The gate-keeper is at ...

2:57:14:

Council Member Kou: That's the Gate-keeper.

2:57:15:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. So, what you have here are the gate-keepers. That -- We expect about twent- -- 30 to 50
around town. Which will gather all this information and -- through the cellular network. OR using the fiber. To send it out
to the cloud. OK. But these are -- the electric meters are about 30,000 electric meters. And about 20,000 gas and
20,000 water. So, the network is -- between these electric meters here -- this is a network. They talk to each other. And
send it over through the ...

2:57:55:

Council Member Kou: But through the network -- it's not -- it's through the Wi-Fi again.

2:58:01:

Shiva Swaminathan: No. It is ...

2:58:01:

Council Member Kou: No? It's though the radio signals ...

2:58:02:
                                                                43
Shiva Swaminathan: ... through it's own mesh -- it's own wireless mesh.

2:58:05:

Council Member Kou: Radio signal.

2:58:05:

Dean Batchelor: Radio signal.

2:58:05:

Shiva Swaminathan: Correct. Right.

2:58:06:

Council Member Kou: OK.

2:58:07:

Dean Batchelor: So, the meters talk to each other. So, as your meter jumps to your neighbors. Then it jumps again to
the next neighbor. And so on, and so on. And then it'll get to a collector.

2:58:16:

Council Member Kou: I see. And then, at the gate ...

2:58:18:

Dean Batchelor: It's a mesh. It's a mesh network.

2:58:19:

Council Member Kou: I see. And then, at the gateway, that's when it uses the ...

2:58:23:

Dean Batchelor: So then, that way, it could -- we could use cellular. Which would then send it to the cloud. And then
send it back to us. For the billing and purposes. Or, we could use our existing fiber, if it's close ...

2:58:36:

Council Member Kou: Um hum.

2:58:36:

Dean Batchelor: ... and then we could use our fiber network. So, we wouldn't have to have -- If the number comes out to
be that we need to have 50 of these gateways, maybe we do only 25 through cellular, and maybe 25 through our
fiber. Maybe. Depending on how the network would run. So there is a combination.

2:58:55:

Council Member Kou: OK. Um. So, what is the -- I mean, it's a great plan. And all. I mean, I think it's -- it's going to be
really effective and productive in reducing carbon. And also, the pricing and everything. But is this going to be discussed
at Council? Or this -- Is the intention for us to be -- putting this onto Consent if we all say -- I mean, I think this is
valuable to be discussed.

2:59:25:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) There's no way this is a Consent item.

2:59:27:

Chair Scharff: Yeah. I didn't think it was either.

2:59:29:

Dean Batchelor: No. I think the idea was -- is that we would put it on Action.

2:59:31:

Council Member Kou: OK.

2:59:31:

Dean Batchelor: And then we would have a full conversation at the Council level.

2:59:34:

Chair Scharff: Well, what you're asking for, at THIS point -- right? -- is really the preliminary steps. I mean, you're
basically looking at -- we're not going to start this until after we finish with -- I forget the acronym -- CS --

2:59:48:

Jon Abendschein: CIS.

2:59:49:

Chair Scharff: The CIS. Right. Which is two years away? Three years away? Right? So, ...

2:59:56:

Shiva Swaminathan: We'll know by middle of next year what the timeline of that is going to be.

2:59:58:

Chair Scharff: Right. So, I mean what this says is, let's go ahead and move forward in having a plan that we're going to
do this. That's how I read this. I read this as, really, no commitment to do this. This is, let's have a plan to do this. You
know. And is Council interested, at this point? And I agree with Council Member Tanaka. I mean, it's a -- it's hopefully a
break-even proposition. I mean, there's a lot of reasons why you probably want to do this. And I'm going to support
this. But this isn't exactly 100 percent, from a financial perspective. If there weren't other issues involved, I wouldn't say
this is a great -- like, oh, from a financial perspective, let's do this. [laughs] You know. So, ...

3:00:45:

Vice Mayor Filseth: Well, it's sort of the opposite. I mean, I think -- I mean, what you want from us tonight -- right? -- is to
validate that it pencils out reasonably, and ...

3:00:55:

Chair Scharff: Right.

3:00:55:

Vice Mayor Filseth: ... you know, it shouldn't be cancelled because the numbers don't work. I mean, that's basically what
you're asking the Finance Committee to do tonight.

3:01:00:

Chair Scharff: Right.


                                                               45
3:01:00:

Dean Batchelor: That's correct.

3:01:00:

Chair Scharff: If you came with a $5 million loss, for instance, I would say no. I mean, I -- Right? But you're basically
saying, ...

3:01:08:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) It breaks even.

3:01:08:

Chair Scharff: ... it probably breaks even.

3:01:09:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) It probably breaks even, so that's not a reason it shouldn't go forward.

3:01:12:

Chair Scharff: Right. Given all the other benefits. That's how I look at it.

3:01:15:

Dean Batchelor: Right.

3:01:17:

Chair Scharff: So, I think you're probably right about it going to Council. But, on the other hand, I think -- how time-
sensitive is this? I mean, was it your plan to bring this to Council, and -- I mean, I'm just looking at our meetings before
the end of the year.

3:01:33:

Dean Batchelor: So, right now, we -- the plan was to come here tonight, and hopefully get an approval. And we're going
to -- we're on the docket for December.

3:01:40:

Chair Scharff: Oh, you are.

3:01:41:

Dean Batchelor: Yes.

3:01:41:

Chair Scharff: OK. Good.

3:01:42:

Dean Batchelor: It's already on the docket.

3:01:43:

Chair Scharff: OK. Great.

3:01:44:
                                                              46
Vice Mayor Filseth: Well, I mean, if for no other reason, it has to go to Council, because -- I mean, deploying it to the
community ...

3:01:52:

Council Member Kou: (unamplified) Yeah.

3:01:52

Vice Mayor Filseth: ... is not going to be a -- hey, let's go do it. [laughs] Right?

3:01:57:

Chair Sharff: OK.

3:01:57:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) I mean, you could have (amplified) people going, "WHY DO I NEED ONE OF THESE
IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE?" And so forth. And so, all that has to be ...

3:02:04:

Dean Batchelor: Yes.

3:02:04:

Chair Scharff: No, I ...

3:02:04:

Vice Mayor Filseth ... system- -- very systematic. And it's a big deal. And it's a big rollout., And it's a huge deal for the
community.

3:02:10:

Chair Sharff: Yeah. And, I mean, that's actually probably the reason why you want to have a discussion at Council. Not
because it's going to change the outcome. Because it's going to give ...

3:02:16:

Council Member Kou: (unamplified) ** communications ...

3:02:16:

Chair Scharff: ... it's going to give -- You know. And I don't usually go that way, but it's going to be "visibility" for the
community that's important.

3:02:26:

Jon Abendschein: Just -- Also, ...

3:01:26:

Vice Mayor Filseth: (unamplified) So, the adoption is going to be (amplified) one of the factors.

3:02:30:

Jon Abendschein: I'll just also note that we're getting a lot of emphasis on that aspect of the rollout from the UAC as
well. That they're emphasizing the community communications and outreach. So we'll get a lot of good feedback on both
fronts.
                                                                47
3:02:41:

Chair Scharff: OK. All right. So, I'll move the staff recommendation. Any further comments? All right. All in favor.

3:02:51:

[All four Council members raise their hands.]

3:02:51:

Chair Scharff: OK. And we'll look forward to your presentation to Council in December.

3:02:56:

[Various speakers]: Thank you. Thank you very much.

Dear Mayor Kniss and Members of the Council,
While the public and our elected officials are focused on Stanford's 2018 GUP
application and their request for a Development Agreement, there is another, quieter
aspect to Stanford's expansion. Over the past few years, Stanford has been buying up
many homes and lots in College Terrace and Evergreen Park as fast as they come on the
market! The current count in these two neighborhoods alone is at least 30 and there is no
indication that they are planning to slow their acquisitions.
Why does this matter? College Terrace has always been home to many Stanford faculty
members and students who have always been valued members of our neighborhood. So
what's different now?
The answer is that once the University owns these properties they are only available to
Stanford employees and will never again be available to the rest of the public! They are
permanently removed from the Palo Alto housing pool, exacerbating our perennial
jobs/housing imbalance.
If Stanford rents them out, no property tax is paid. And if they "sell" them, it is on a
ground lease basis, which typically means that the "purchaser" pays less tax than if the
home was purchased on the open market.
To make matters worse, Stanford has been leaving many of these homes empty for
months or even years, creating a "ghost house" environment in our neighborhood. This
erodes our community connections and decreases our neighborhood safety since we
have less "eyes on the street".
And once they do take action, that action is generally to demolish and replace these
houses, many of which are 100 years old or older. Replacing these charming older
homes is rapidly eroding our neighborhood's unique quirky character. Although
Stanford claims that they are designing "sensitive" replacements, the new homes cannot
possibly have the patina and history of the original homes being demolished.
Residents on Cornell Street are being faced with multiple demolitions on a single block!
And the charming 110 year-old Craftsman shingle bungalow next door to me has a
nearly new roof and a recent high-end kitchen makeover. Sending all that to the landfill
is absurd.
It is not obvious what the Council can do to stop this land grab but at a minimum, the
College Terrace Residents' Association asks that you use your voice in the upcoming
Development Agreement and GUP negotiations with Stanford to insist that the effects of
their actions be considered in the process. They should commit to halting the
acquisition and especially the demolition of additional existing off-campus homes. And
they should ensure that any home that they purchase should be occupied within three
months of acquisition.
Sincerely,


Q~~-

Palo Alto City Council


Dear Palo Alto City Council,

I am writing in support of Rinconada Masters Swim Team's use of the municipal Rinconada
pool. I joined Rinconada Masters when I moved to Palo Alto around 1994 and have been a
member ever since.

I do not understand the reason for a new Swimming Pool administration to cancel one long-
time Masters program in favor of another.

Not all Masters clubs are the same. Some empathize competitive swimming and feature
tough workouts and favoritism towards the skilled swimmers. Rinconada Masters does
offer workouts for all skill levels, but does not pressure anyone to compete.

As you know, Rinconada Masters is a home-grown club that has enjoyed tremendous public
support within the Palo Alto community. It is an important resource for both Palo Alto and
surrounding communities. Its annual swim meet in March at Riconada pool is very
popular, attracting Masters swimmers from all over the Bay area. To make it work, all club
members participate as timers, deck support, etc and contribute eatable goods for sale.

The club caters to all ages and is especially supportive of non-competitive fitness swimmers
and seniors. I myself am 74 years old, and there are many swimmers my age and older who
are active in the workouts. We welcome new members constantly.

The key to a successful Masters swim club is good coaching and tailored workouts. A
typical swim workout is about 1 hour and for my intermediate level of skill the total length
is about 2700 yards or about 1 1/2 miles. I like the 6am workouts Monday, Wednesday and
Friday to avoid commute traffic, which means getting to the pool around 5:45am to take off
the covers. It was also a good time, before I retired, for a workout before going to my job.
The workout is not simply swimming laps. The coaches typically write out 3 sets of
workout routines (low stress, intermediate and advanced) for groups of lanes across the
      pool which include short and long-distance sets where we are swimming timed intervals
      which changes daily, keeping it interesting and varied.

      I attribute my current health and fitness to my Rinconada Masters workouts. It is a
      supportive group that is a local treasure. Losing it would have a negative impact on all club
      me~bers, especic~lly~eniors and the citizens of Palo Alto.

Distinguished members of the Palo Alto City Council--         CITY OF PALO ALTO CA
                                                               CITY CL[HK'S OFFICE
I hope you all are well.
                                                               f8 OCT 3 J AH fO: 00
Primarily, if I may, I would prefer to give you all a brief introduction of myself: My name is Paul Minsker, and I am a
19-year-old university student originally from central Arkansas and majoring in Geography at San Jose State that
occasionally takes Caltrain to visit your city for some of its countless recreational and retail opportunities.

The main entity in your city that I choose to visit on my trips, however, I feel needs no introduction to you all: The
El Palo Alto Redwood tree rooted in El Palo Alto Park. From the moment my mother made me aware of a
newspaper article she read discussing famous trees that vaguely mentioned "a Redwood in the city of Palo Alto
that Portola once camped beside" (she knows my love for trees), I was intrigued as to where this tree existed, how
the plant was doing, and what type of prominence such a historically significant tree in your city would receive.

My first brief visit to the tree in late August of this year (I had limited time as per the tree being so well hidden) was
a learning experience, most certainly, seeing an 1100 year old being in front of me still alive to this day. As my
visits to the tree occurred at later times, and as I began to research this tree online, my knowledge of the true
significance and meaning of this tree only exponentialized by the day. I learned about the tree being California
State Historical Landmark No. 2, the location where the entire Bay Peninsula was essentially founded as a
Spanish mission settlement area, the reason for the city of Palo Alto having the name, and even the reason why
Stanford University has the tree logo as their uniting symbol despite the fact that no official school mascot
evidently exists. I learned about the tree's appraisal for a meager $55,600, about the misting system to "fool the
tree" that was installed to bring water to the tree's upper limbs for coaxing the plant back to health as illness
struck, and about the tree being a waypoint for navigators on the original El Camino Real, as well as the primary
distant marker for construction of said roadway, as well as the railroad that Caltrain now operates on. I read of
railroad spikes being hammered into the trunk (they are still there wedged in the trunk today) to help early
Stanford students into the tree's upper limbs to try and see which one of them could fly their fraternity I school flag
the highest on the tree (I also saw that this tradition ceased as per the acrophobia of a youth in 1909 that found
himself stuck near the top).

I even was able between my visits to gather information about why the tree looks in such a form today, as per the
upper portions of the tree being removed progressively as the cities of Palo Alto and Menlo Park lowered the
water table of the area for their citizenry to have water access, slowly killing the tree at the extremities. The tree
was once three-trunked, of course, with a debate still in place as to the second trunk's demise being by way of the
flooded San Francisquito Creek in a winter storm or by the rail bridge beside the tree being constructed with
equipment that caused the mishap. In all honesty, I even learned as per my research that I am not the only person
that has ever taken the time to write to your organization on the tree's behalf, as per my findings that the plant
was in such a state of nearness-to-death from lack of water, the polluted and flooding San Francisquito Creek,
and the nearby railroad trestles weighing down the shallow roots that it was brought to your attention by a Mr. Jim
Johnson that something to help the now-largely-human-reliant tree must be done.

Honorable council members, I am, by no means, nearly as qualified in my assertions as Mr. Johnson was in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, but I cannot deny to any of you that my frequent observations of this tree and the
immediate surroundings lead me to bring two crucial elements at play to committee attention.

Primarily, in short, please allow for me to take a moment to commend your city on an obvious victory in saving this
tree for the time being from near-death, what with the misting system and reinforcing the northern side of the trunk
with concrete going down into the creek. From what I have read of this tree, the plant has experienced many
years of lack of water, vandals destroying lower branches and defacing the trunk, and especially the nearby
railroad bringing with it a generation of smoke-belching trains killing off the tree's west side; added to this
presently are daily passenger and freight trains that shake and rattle the ground on the three walkable sides of the
trunk when they chug past (I have personally felt such). Indeed, the tree has taken a large bounce back to
prominent life, despite being more so these days a bushy, stocky tree than the plant originally was back in the day
as a taller, slimmer version of self. The tree is obviously, as solely pertaining to the trunk and crown structures, in
decent form, with the failing roots obviously being supplemented by the mister, yet I cannot deny to your
organization that my praise for your assistance to this tree, from here onwards, must definitively end.

I write to you today, if I may, to most prominently bring to your immediate and unconditional attention the second
collection of elements of my El Palo Alto comment I concern:
    1. The tree is still often being vandalized in between my visits there, especially as per new markings
         on the dead section where once stood the second trunk being seen.
    2. The tree is still frequented by vagabonds, many of which often verbally hassle me in various
         regards as I attempt to have a quiet moment sitting in nature before their running into the adjacent
         woods down towards their presumed encampments in the San Francisquito Creek.
    3. The tree is still under daily threat from the railroad, as train after train rattles the roots and
         threatens to fall the giant should the misting system and nearby ground structure around the trunk
         not be maintained.
    4. The tree often smells from over five feet away as if humans have urinated upon parts of the trunk
         (and, therefore, given that Redwood trees are not naturally known to smell of urine, I would
         conclude only one possibility for this observation that needs no further detail on my end).
     5. The tree ALWAYS, upon my visits, has garbage littered around the trunk base: just recently were
         broken sunglasses, cigarette butts, and Reese's wrappers, and traditionally there have been soda
         cans, water bottles, alcohol, coats and blankets, mats laid out as if someone caught a nap and left,
         and always an insane amount of spread-out newspapers. There is evidence that the garbage is
         occasionally removed (I have often done so, myself) by some individual and/or entity, which I
         commend, but the above issue of my concern still prominently stands, especially given that much
         of the garbage in question simply is "cleared out" by being naturally blown by passing trains and
         winds into the creek.
     6. This might seem rather silly, I am sure, but the fact that so, so many people that I witness walk and
         bike on the trail beside the tree to get between Palo Alto and Menlo Park and seem to give the
         great being no mind personally aggravates me, and has shown me exactly how it is in these
         present, tech-savvy times how the human ability to connect with nature is oh, so rapidly being lost.
         I have not yet done a study of such, I must admit, but let us assume, based on my observations,
         that these people pass this tree as if there is nothing significant to see. They are likely unaware
         that the tree is the reason for the name of the park. They are likely unaware that the tree is the
         reason for the name of the adjacent avenue. They are likely unaware that the tree is the reason for
         the Stanford logo existing with a tree. They are likely unaware that the tree is the reason for the
         name of the entire CITY. They likely do not bother to notice the tree's two plaques, for they may feel
         that they are not worth the time to read. They are choosing, of course, as is their right, to remain
         blissfully unaware of the natural, historical, and literal giant that stands near them, yet I must
         assert, in my final concern, that it is the complete. total. entire. wholistic. and undeniable
         responsibility of the city of Palo Alto--the city named after THIS VERY TREE--to educate and inform
         the citizenry of the living. growing. could-soon-be-dying being BEHIND the name. BEHIND the
         Stanford logo. BEHIND their backs as they mosey on by.
       As for any potential solutions to any and/or all of these dilemmas at hand, I leave all final decisions as
necessarily proper to your city and your organization, but I must assert, nonetheless, my own personal ideas
presently that I feel could directly benefit the tree, El Palo Alto Park patrons, and the city of Palo Alto as a whole.

    •   El Palo Alto Park should, as soon as reasonably possible, have garbage cans I recycle bins
        installed in it along the Palo Alto city side of the trail between Palo Alto Avenue and the bridge to
        Menlo Park. This would, most certainly, come at a cost to the city to install and maintain, yet I can
        personally feel as if the placement of said garbage cans could only encourage park patrons to be
        responsible with their trash and recyclables, as opposed to littering them along the trail, around
        the tree, or even directly into the creek, thereby making the next portion of my proposition. ideally.
        almost obsolete.
    •   To deal with the present littering I garbage problem that you cannot reasonably deny is at hand,
        there must be a reasonable effort in place to hold city and/or community clean-ups in the park and
        down in the creek to ensure that the environment here can continue to bounce back ideally so
        rather than regress back to the days when the creek (so I have read} used to flood with garbage
        clogs at various points along its length. Your neighboring city of Menlo Park, as with the county of
        San Mateo--given that the creek is a city AND a county divide--could even likely take interest in this
        as well should you, as a city, bring this jointly-brought-about issue to their attention.
    •   In speaking of entering the creek for garbage cleanup and shoreline maintenance, as per my
        observations of various vagabonds entering and leaving the creekbed, it should be a Palo Alto
        direct responsibility to take charge--even if Menlo Park shall not--of regularly sending police into El
        Palo Alto Park to patrol the grounds and check the creek for any potential transients that likely are
        only further contributing to the area's environmental degradation (as I have read, their rat poisons
        sprayed and fecal matter left in the creek bed are not news to your city in that they occur}.
    •   Any and all railroad resurfacing I track maintenance or construction projects on either the
        Northbound or the Southbound line occurring directly in the proximity of the tree must be
        consulted by a knowledgeable arborist (knowledgeable ESPECIALLY to the history of El Palo Alto}
        supplied by the city to ensure that any of said projects do not directly impose any new,
        unprecedented strains on the tree I the tree's roots.
    •   At the cost of the city, in couplement with the pre-existing system of lights and lamps along the
        trail beside the tree, I find it best to discourage nighttime questionable activities at the base of the
        tree--such as urinating, littering, and/or vandalism··by way of the installation beside the tree of
        floodlights that are angled so as to illuminate the lower trunk, and hopefully do such without
        distracting passing cars on Palo Alto Avenue and/or train drivers on the nearby tracks. Installation
        and maintenance of these lights is a commitment, most certainly, yet I cannot help but note that
        this cannot be too much of a stretch with trail lights nearby already existing and being (as far as I
        can see} properly maintained.
    •   Provided the city of Palo Alto would desire carrying the above illumination consideration a step
        further, the installation of a security camera on the west side of the tree facing east could only help
        to further discourage--at ANY time--tree desecration, littering, urinating, vandalism, and/or illegal
        vagabond endeavors. This would be a drastic measure, I concede, yet a camera as such could
        guarantee--so long as it is operational consistently and properly guarded from tampering--needing
        to dispatch less law enforcement agencies to the park and only doing so on an as-needed basis if
        the camera has a live stream to the Palo Alto Police Department or an entity of the sort.
    •   My final proposition, if I may, is the one that I might personally feel can be where you distinguished
        individuals and myself can meet on the most direct ground: I propose that the city of Palo Alto--perhaps
       even in a joint effort with the El-Palo-Alto-branded Stanford Unjversjty--somehow. in some way.
       organize and hold in as near of a future as possible an "EL PALO ALTO APPRECIATION DAY" that
       can hopefully bring together the people of this great city in a united effort to fight against losing
       the living, standing being that is indirectly the reason behind why all of you exist in the place that
       you do today. Holding this Appreciation Day would help to spread the El Palo Alto protection
       cause, granting your city government (hopefully) hundreds of new allies that can watch out for the
       tree and speak out in the case that something regarding the being that they observe might not
       seem properly decent (thereby placing the local government and law enforcement in less of a tree
       "watchdog" role and shifting said responsibility to the citizenry). The Appreciation Day could also
       very likely decrease will among the populus that happens by to randomly vandalize / litter the area
       once they hopefully realize the significance of the living history that they choose to alter simply for
       their own contrived pleasure. Holding festivities on this day could, as well, provided that an
       admission is charged and I or vendor stand permits are granted, grant your city DIRECT funding
       that could generate revenue to ensure that any and all of the above considerations of changes
       could very well get underway. Holding this Appreciation Day, hands down, if properly advertised,
       could also even generate tourist revenue In your city, with people traveling from around the Bay,
       across the state, and even potentially beyond to be acquainted with this silent shrine that has seen
       more history in life than many of us can even remotely fathom. If people enter the city to see the
       tree, they will also likely want to go shopping here as well, and, with the Stanford Mall so close by,
       people could use this day to partake in retail excursions as such with the unintended consequence
       of also flowing new money into the local economy. Stanford University could also be economically
       I socially benefited by advertising at the Appreciation Day for already having a history so closely
       tied with the tree (and hopefully a future history where such can only continue to be so). The
       economic potentials of this day for your city are undeniable, and I can certainly only hope that a
       properly advertised inaugural celebration with vendors, souvenirs, and speakers from the city,
       Stanford University, the Palo Alto Historical Association, and even perhaps general citizens like me
       that love the tree could help everyone involved reach their own personal goals while still hopefully
       not forgetting to help out this magnificent tree.
   •   This is not a direct proposition from me, but I would dare say, respectfully, that I feel as if speaking on
       behalf of the tree for a continued life and proper welfare in the face of human environmental threats to the
       attendees at an event such as an Appreciation Day ceremony could very well be a highlight in my Bay
       Area experience, to know that 1--a modest person from Arkansas-can devote myself to help a living being
       that means a lot to me, and increasingly more so with each visit to the monumental plant that I take.

Palo Alto City Council Members, I profusely thank you for your time and consideration, and wish you all only the
best from now until furthermore. I trust that any and all of my considerations regarding El Palo Alto shall be taken
as fully seriously as they are expressed, and that any and all of my propositions emphasized can only be
executed so long as they are deemed by your city to be what is known as best for the health and safety of El Palo
Alto Park patrons and for the continued and healthy existence of the El Palo Alto tree.

Best wishes, and all my best

 Elimination of Rinconada Masters Program

   My name is Nate Gallon. I write to you on behalf of my swim team, Rinconada Masters.

   Last week, Carol MacPherson, another Masters representative and I met with Tim Sheeper at his offices in Menlo Park to
   discuss the renewal of Rinconada Masters' contract for 2019 and beyond. Unfortunately, Tim told us quite clearly that he
   had no plans to renew our subcontract for Masters swimming at Rinconada after the contract expires on December 31,
   2018. To say that we were surprised and dismayed is an understatement. Despite our team's working in good faith with
   Tim's organization throughout the duration of our current contract, Tim simply indicated that he no longer wanted to work
   with us. At our meeting with Tim last week, he was not interested in discussing revised pricing or lane sharing with us. He
   did not want to consider our contracting with his lifeguards to cover our swim practices even though Tim did reach
   agreement with PASA on its usage of the pool with revised pricing for 2019. Is Rinconada Masters not entitled to a similar
   courtesy?

   Nor does Tim have a plan for masters at Rinconada beginning on January 1, 2019. He does not have pricing or workout
   times determined and he does not have a masters coach or team ready to go. Not has he solicited feedback from
   Rinconada Masters team members on what any alternative masters program would look like. As it currently stands, we will
   have no Masters program at Rinconada Pool beginning on January 1, 2019 even though we understood that service for all
   swim programs at Rinconada was supposed to continue under the new contract. Reduction in or elimination or the masters
   program beginning on January 1, 2019 does not represent "expanded aquatics services".

   There is a straightforward way to address this situation. We have an existing Masters program that is already an integral
   part of the Palo Alto community - our team. Rinconada Masters is a Palo Alto institution and is ready and excited to
   continue to serve the Palo Alto community (and beyond) as it has for the last 46 years. Our team under Carol MacPherson
   should continue to be able to manage the Masters program at Rinconada. We have wanted to present Masters
   subcontracting proposals to Tim that will provide for enhanced economics for Tim's organization but have been told that
   those proposals will not make a difference in Tim's decision. Our team is to leave Rinconada on December 31, 2018. End
   of story. No discussion. No appeal. No compromise.

   I have been swimming at Rlnconada pool since 1999 and have been part of the Rinconada Masters program since 2001. In
   addition to our program serving the Palo Alto community, what I find most inspiring about the Rinconada Masters program
   and Carol is the number of senior citizens in our program. Our Rinconada Masters program has just the right combination
   of structure and flexibility in the workouts and approach to swimming that makes this program unique. It is very different
   from Tim's Menlo Masters program, the program approach that I would expect Tim to implement if he ever decided to have
   a different masters program at Rinconada. I am a Menlo Park resident but I choose to come to Rinconada because of Carol
   and our program's approach and because it is not Menlo Masters. We should preserve this approach at Rinconada and not
   discard it out of hand.

   Tim has made it clear that he considers our team difficult to work with and that he no longer wishes to engage with us. I
   firmly believe that we have been constructive throughout the duration of our subcontract with Tim's organization. Further,
   we believe that we can work constructively with Tim to come to agreement on a new Masters subcontract at Rinconada. I
   would personally volunteer to work with Tim to come up with an arrangement on pricing, lane usage and life guard
   coverage that can work for all parties.

   We urge the commission and Tim to engage with Rinconada Masters. Our program is a community resource, and this
   resource will be lost if we simply scrap Rinconada Masters out of hand without even attempting to explore how we can
   preserve this 46-year old Palo Alto institution.

   Best Regards,

   Nate Gallon

To City of Palo Alto Council                                             October 29, 2018

From Carol Macpherson, Founder and Rinconada Masters Swimming Coach since
1973 (46 years) and proud member of United States Masters swimming
organization described below:

U.S. Masters swimming encourages adults to enjoy the health, fitness, and social benefits of
swimming by providing more than 2,000 adults swim programs and events across the county,
including open water and pool competitions. USMS nearly 65,000 members range from age 18
-99 and include swimmers of all ability levels. USMS, a nonprofit, also trains and certifies
coaches and provides other valuable information.

Our Rinconada coaches have gone to clinics every year to be certified by USMS as
coaches and are proud to have learned and to practice all aspects of coaching
master swimmers of all ages and abilities.

Prior to Team Sheeper's contract, the Rinconada Masters' safety protocol for the
prior 45 years at the Rinconada pool consisted of our coaches being certified in
CPR, AED, and First Aid. The City of Palo Alto's previous aquatic directors felt we
complied with their requirements. We had no complaints and a strong working
relationship. We currently have 3 certified life guards and 14 swimmers who are
certified in CPR, AED and First Aid. These certifications are through OSHA which
follows guidelines of the Red Cross and the American Heart Association.

For safety reasons, I felt having additional swimmers on our team with this
certification would be beneficial to our program--a practice we also followed 15
years ago when we had 24 swimmers certified

    •   Since its inception, Rinconada has always had a productive and positive
        relationship with the City, parks and rec. dept and previous aquatic
        directors
    •   We are a big part of the local community and have demonstrated this in
        our efforts to work together over the past 46 years
    •   We are more than willing to work with Team Sheeper
    •   Please keep our present team at Rinconada pool.
                              RINCONADA MASTERS-LIFEGUARDING


One of Team Sheeper's reasons for not renewing the Rinconada Masters contract is due to
lifeguarding issues.

In the Fall of 2017, Team Sheeper notified our head coach, Carol MacPerson, that our team
needed to hire lifeguards to cover our swim practices during the times that we had exclusive use
of the pool. This totals 10.5 hours per week.

An option was to hire Team Sheeper's lifeguards at $25.00 per hour, per guard which would cost
our team $1050.00 per month. In addition to our pool rental dues, this posed financial
difficulties for our team.

Carol notified Team Sheeper that she would find an American Red Cross Lifeguard Instructor
and would be asking Rinconada Master swimmers to volunteer their time and take the
lifeguarding course along with the coaches, Carol and Terri.

There were a total of 6 participants who took the 2 day 20 hour course in November of 2017 at
Rinconada pool.

At its completion 3 of us passed the lifeguard certification course. Even though 3 of the 6
participants did not pass the rigorous course, they did complete the full 2 day, 20 hour program.

As of October, 2018, we found and hired 2 additional lifeguards and we are still looking for 1-2
more. With there being a shortage of lifeguards, this process is slow and difficult.

Rinconada Masters is committed to safety in and around Rinconada pool. We are continuing to
search for lifeguards and are doing our best to remedy the lifeguard situation.

Sincerely,
Terri Baxter-Smith
Assistant Coach-Rinconada Masters

Dear City Council,


        I have been a member of Rinconada Masters since 3 years and would like to express my support
to this program.
        I am a 37 years old working mother, with 2 children of 4 years old and 6 months. Over the past 3
years, swimming at Rinconada masters has been a very important part of my life balance, providing me
with a way to exercise and feel well in my body, away from the stress of family duties and work
pressure.
        I believe that the spirit of Rinconada Masters is very unique in that it offers its members the
ability to swim with competitive or not competitive goals as they desire, and always with the
encouragements of the coach and the great atmosphere the community of its members have created
over the year. Carol and Terry have been very supportive when I have experienced serious back ache
and have provided me with personalized advice to keep practicing and adjust my practice to relief the
pain. After my pregnancies, I have felt like swimming at Rinconanda masters was a great chance to go
back to shape at my own pace, with adjustable swimming goals. I know that I would not have found the
same support and flexibility of workouts in any other masters in Palo Alto or neighboring cities or in
open lap swim programs.
The community of members is amazing. I am especially impressed with the group of women who have
been swimming together for years at Rinconanda. In addition to swimming 3 times or more every week,
they find at Rinconada their peers. Clearly, the masters is a very important part of their social life.
Where else could women from 20 to 80 years old practice together each at their own pace and be able
to share their passion for sport without regards to their age? And after the practice enjoy discussing
private and social matters in a joyful spirit? Coming from France and without much social roots in the
Bay Area, I was surprised and pleased by the welcoming and warm environment of the club.
        I feel very lucky I can swim with Rinconanda Masters members under the coaching of Carol
Macpherson and Terry and do not think I would be able to find any equivalent program if it were to
disappear.

                              RINCONADA MASTERS-LIFEGUARDING


One of Team Sheeper's reasons for not renewing the Rinconada Masters contract is due to
lifeguarding issues.

In the Fall of 2017, Team Sheeper notified our head coach, Carol MacPerson, that our team
needed to hire lifeguards to cover our swim practices during the times that we had exclusive use
of the pool. This totals 10.5 hours per week.

An option was to hire Team Sheeper's lifeguards at $25.00 per hour, per guard which would cost
our team $1050.00 per month. In addition to our pool rental dues, this posed financial
difficulties for our team.

Carol notified Team Sheeper that she would find an American Red Cross Lifeguard Instructor
and would be asking Rinconada Master swimmers to volunteer their time and take the
lifeguarding course along with the coaches, Carol and Terri.

There were a total of 6 participants who took the 2 day 20 hour course in November of 2017 at
Rinconada pool.

At its completion 3 of us passed the lifeguard certification course. Even though 3 of the 6
participants did not pass the rigorous course, they did complete the full 2 day, 20 hour program.

As of October, 2018, we found and hired 2 additional lifeguards and we are still looking for 1-2
more. With there being a shortage of lifeguards, this process is slow and difficult.

Rinconada Masters is committed to safety in and around Rinconada pool. We are continuing to
search for lifeguards and are doing our best to remedy the lifeguard situation.

Sincerely,
Terri Baxter-Smith
Assistant Coach-Rinconada Masters
My name is Timothy Groves. I am currently a Palo Alto resident and a member of
Rinconada Masters swim club. We currently have a contract with Team Sheeper
for our use of the Rinconada pool. We support this contract and abide by it
willingly.

Last week Tim Sheeper informed us that he intends to unilaterally cancel our
contract after the New Year and reassign our swim lanes to another group. This
would effectively bar us from using Rinconada pool, which we have done
continuously since 1972.

As one reason he cites the lack of certified lifeguards and individuals certified in
CPR/AED. This is incorrect. We have three lifeguards with current and valid Red
Cross certificates. In addition we have 14 swimmers with current and valid
CPR/AED certification. We meet our contractual obligation to have these people
present and on duty at the pool.

He further cites that Rinconada Masters fail to communicate with Team Sheeper.
This is a misrepresentation, as we are perfectly willing to communicate. In fact, no
 one in our group has ever seen Tim Sheeper at the pool during our designated
·workout times. Most of us have never met him. He is simply never present.

We therefore have two requests to put before the Parks and Recreation Council:

   -   Our existing contract between Rinconada Masters and Team Sheeper be
       renewed effective January 1, 2019, with no change in our use of the facility.
   -   Parks and Recreation increase its oversight of contractor Team Sheeper to
       prevent what threatens to become a devastating and unfair situation for
       Rinconada Masters.

     I'm here representing the Rinconada Masters Swim Team. Rinconada Masters is a group of adult largely PA residents that
     has been active for 40+ yrs and is recognized in the Masters· Swim community.

     1year ago PA contracted with a private company to run Rinconada Pool; although, the city owns it and is financially
     responsible for it.

     The private company's currently proposed renewal contract excludes the existing subcontract with Rinconada Masters
     citing 3 reasons:

     1 Safety - there a not always 2 life guards on duty at all times.

     2 Communication - Rinconada Masters does not communicate with the private company.

     3 Respect:- I don't know what this means in this situation.

     R.M. disagrees with the facts that are being presented regarding the 3 reasons cited, but, to keep it simple, R.M. will have
     2 life guards on duty during our hours, and we are interested in working with the private operators of the pool to improve
     communication.

     There is no good reason why R.M., a group of largely PA residents, that has been active for 40+ yrs, should not be allowed
     to exist under a renewed subcontract with the private company that runs the city's pool.

   To whom it may concern:

   When it is revealed that a U.S. Masters-affiliated swim club, that has been using the Rinconada Pool
   facility for more than 40 years without blemish, flaw, incident or upset, is about to be turfed out for no
   stated reason it would be the most blinkered city official who did not take notice.

   True, Palo Alto has changed a lot over those 40 years. But many of its citizens and their needs have
   not. The basic parameters of a regular lap swim are the same year to year and are not that
   complicated. The Rinconada Masters members have been model citizens and responsible users of
   the facili~ since before many of its current staff were born.

   What is the point of keeping and maintaining such a pool facility if a body of its core, dedicated, and
   frequent users are going to be summarily jettisoned from its community without thought, consideration
   or reason?

   The Rinconada Masters .-p swim program should be cherished and upheld as a constant of the
   community and not simply discarded during an administrative upheaval.

   We, the Rinconada swimmers, are the taxpayers of Palo Alto who have given our tax money to build the pool and
   maintain it for 40+ years.

   We are a diverse group of people united by our love for swimming, for our coaches, and our care and respect for each
   other.

   We feel that we deserve to keep the pool for our community recreation needs instead of giving it away to a private party.
   It would be a sad day if our Master's program is effectively canceled.
   Please reconsider this new contract that disregards our needs and look towards finding a win-win solution instead.

   Thanks and regards,

   Marija Jovanovic
