Architectural Review Board Meeting of April 5, 2018
ARB Application 17PLN-00331- 620 Emerson Street
Today's Date: April 4, 2018




Architectural Review Board (ARB)
City of Palo Alto
250 Hamilton Avenue
Palo Alto, CA 94301


Subject:        YO LLC Objections to ARB Approval of Application 17PLN-00331
                620 Emerson Street, Palo Alto




YO LLC reaffirms its previous objections delivered to the ARB at its February 1, 2018, meeting,
and requests that the ARB deny approval of subject project. In addition, please consider the
following:


1) Elimination of On-Site Parking

    YO LLC objects to the elimination of the existing parking areas on the property by allowing
    the applicant to pay in lieu and to construct a building which eliminates such parking. Palo
    Alto's downtown properties including this one at 620 Emerson belong to a Parking
    Assessment District. According to the Assessment Roll included as Appendix 2 to the Final
    Engineer's Report prepared for the City in March, 2001, (See Attachment) the district has
    2,124 on-site parking spaces. If developers were to be allowed to buy their way into
    eliminating on-site parking these 2,000-plus parking spaces (many with the same
    configuration as 620 Emerson with rear parking from a 20-ft wide alley) can be eliminated
    from the City's supply of parking. The intensity of traffic and infrastructure use imposed by
    this new project cannot be remedied by simply having the applicant pay into a future
    parking fund. Underground parking and mechanically-assisted parking are two options that
    have not received due consideration for this project.

    No project within the Downtown Core should receive a recommendation by staff for
    approval without exhausting all options to preserve either a portion of a site's existing
    parking or to fully-park a project to the City's parking policies. Allowing the applicant to pay
    in lieu in this instance simply exacerbates the current parking pain and pushes the parking
    problems it will create to be dealt with in some future uncertain time, to the detriment of
    our quality of life. The elimination of any on-site parking as currently proposed by the
    project will have a significantly adverse effect to businesses along Emerson Street.


2) No Provision for a Loading Zone




                                                Page 1
Architectural Review Board Meeting of April 5, 2018
ARB Application 17PLN-00331- 620 Emerson Street
Today's Date: April 4, 2018


    Restaurant uses require accessible loading zones for food deliveries. This is an intense, daily
    occurrence. Emerson Street between Hamilton Avenue and Forest Avenue has no loading
    zones that can be utilized by the proposed restaurant land use. This will result double
    parking impacts along Emerson Street that severely impact the operations of businesses on
    this street block. High Street between Hamilton Avenue and Forest Avenue also lacks
    loading zones. The use of the existing driveway and alleyway will impact existing businesses
    if blocked by loading at the rear of the site. Hamilton Avenue provides a Loading zone along
    the front of the Epiphany Palo Alto Hotel but that site is already heavily used and
    inconvenient for deliveries to 620 Emerson Street. The site as it exists now is not impacted
    by loading zone issues because it provides three (3) existing on-site parking spaces and has
    additional on-site access through the rear garage doors that serve the site.

3) Independent Restroom Facilities

    YO LLC objects because the proposed conditions of approval do not and should include
    restroom facilities independent of neighboring structures. Even if it is the intention of the
    applicant to operate new uses within the subject site in conjunction with adjacent
    properties, ensuring that the site can operate independently in the future will help allow
    future land use choices on the site. Alternatively, the adjacent Epiphany Hotel should
    include a recorded in-perpetuity access easements for the use of restroom facility or any
    other utilities that are intended to jointly serve both sides, or the subject project should
    have a recorded agreement that the developer will provide and pay for independent
    restrooms within the property in the future. Such agreement and access easements should
    be presented in conjunction with any proposed land use decision for the subject property.


Sincerely,

METHOD OF ASSESSMENT

GENERAL.

The Assessment District is fonned under the authority of the Municipal Improvement Act of 1913
(the Act) and Article XIIID of the California State Constitution, and in accordance with the
Proposition 218 Omnibus Implementation Act (chapt. 28, 1997 stats.) as supplemented by the
provisions of Section 13.12.050 of the Palo Alto Improvement Procedure Code, which require that
local agencies levy assessments based on the special benefits provided by the project. In addition,
Article XIIID, Section 4, of the State Constitution requires that a parcel's assessment may not exceed
the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that.parcel. Section 4 provides
that only special benefits are assessable and the local agency levying the assessment must separate the
general benefits from th~ special benefits. It also requires that publicly owned property that benefits
from the i~provements be assessed. Neither the Act nor the State Constitution specifies the method
or formula that should he used to apportion the costs to properties in any special assessment district
proceedings. The responsibility for recommending an apportionment of the costs to properties which
specially beqefit from the improvements rests with the Assessment Engineer, who is appointed for the
purpose of making an analysis of the facts and determining the correct apportionment of the
assessment obligation. Therefore, costs and expenses of proposed improvement(s) will be apportioned
against the properties by a fonnula or method that proportionally and equitably distributes the costs in
direct proportion to the estimated special benefits these parcels receive from the improvements.

The approval of the assessments rests with the City Council. The Council renders its decision after
hearing testimony and evidence presented at a public hearing and tabulating the assessment ballots
which are mailed to all record owners of property within the Assessment District. Only ballots
delivered to the City prior·to the cJose of the public hearing are tabulated. The Council's findings
must include whether or not the assessment spread has been made in direct proportion to the
estimated special benefits received by each parcel.

Assessment ballots are weighted by the amount of the assessment. The ballot tabulation is finalized
after the c1ose of the Public Hearing. If fifty percent or more of the weighted assessment ballots
submitted favor the levy of the assessments, then the Council may proceed. If the majority of the
weighted ballots (more than 50%) oppose the levy of assessment, then the proceedings must be
abandoned.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Universit)' Avenue Area is a diversy 'mixed-use area with a combination of offices, retail
establishments, restaurants, civic facilities and.some higher density residences. The goal of both the
City and the property owners in the area has been to "promote the economic health of Downtown,
encourage retail vitality and variety and increase potential for a variety of uses". 1

The zoning designations within the University Avenue area are Commercial Downtown (..CD"). The
CD district is intended to:

The University Avenue Parking Assessment District was established in 1975 with the goal of
providing safe, convenient parking. Since its inception, the University.Avenue Parking Assessment
District has acquired 20 lots and constructed 2 parking garages. The Parking Assessment District has
worked to create a downtown parking "system" with a variety of parking opportunities. The parking
system: supports an area where visitors perform multiple tasks (dine, shop, run errands) and are able to
walk easily between various business establishments.

In 1994, the City in cooperation.with downtown property owners and the Chamber of Commerce,
brought forward a "Comprehensive Parking Plan for Downtown" (the "Comprehensive Plan). The
Comprehensive Plan identified and addressed a deficit of parking in the Downtown area. The Plan
recommended the construction of new parking facilities. The City has been working since 1994 to
devel?P plans for construction .of new parking garages on surface Jots S and L, near the center of
downtown and surface lot R, on the southwesterly side of downtown.
                ·,
Together, the new garages will add approximately 700 new parking spaces to the downtown system.
The SIL Garage consists of seven levels, two below grade and five above grade, and incorporates
space, not suitable for.parking and reserved for future private or public use, within the design.' The R
Garage 1ncludes five levels all above grade and the structure is completely devoted to parking. To date
the City has completed planning, environmental documentation and 50-percent design on two new
garages. This assessment district is proP.osed to generate over $45 million of funding for the
construction of the 11ew garages and refinancing of existing assessment bonds at more favorable rates
and terms.                                            ·                      ·

BENEFIT.

Considerations from Proposition 218

In November 1996, the voters of California approved Proposition 218, which added Articles XIIIC
and XIIID to the California State Constitution. Proposition 218 added new procedures and
requirements fqr all ,assessments. Particularly, Proposition 218 requires the fo11owing:

           The assessment proceedings must identify all parcels which will have special benefit
           conferred upon them, including property owned by Federal, State or Local government
           agencies.

           "Special benefit') means "particular and distinct benefit over and above general benefits
           conferred on real property located in the district or to the public at large." General
           enhancement of property value is not considered to be a "special benefit."

The assessment on a parcel may not exceed the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit
conferred on the parcel. The improvements proposed for the Assessment District must meet the
special benefit test of Proposition 218. Additionally, the assessment on each parcel must not exceed
the cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on the parcel.

Special Benefit Analysis

        . Definition of "Special Benefit": A property benefits from the parking system when the
        · availability of that system helps offset requirements imposed by the City through its planning
          or zoning process. This benefit is most clearly illustrated by a commercially zoned property
          with no onsite parking: development and use of the property would be prohibited by current
          planning and zoning criteria if an alternate parking system were not available. In these cases,
          the downtown parking system is integral to the highest and best use of property within that
          system.

           History of the Benefit Area: The University A venue Area (also referred to as the
           "Downtown Area") received increasing City attention in the mid-l 980s. The 1984-1986
           Downtown Study addre5sed the increased parking and traffic problems resulting in part from
           a surge in Downtown office building construction. 3 The Study responded to a period of rapid
           commercial growth that resulted in increased parking and traffic problems and raised the issue
           of the compatibility of new downtown construction with existing development. 4 The study
           res~dted in new parking regulations in theUniversity Avenue Parking Assessment District as
           part of a comprehensive effort to assure reasonable commercial development and employment
           centers within the downtown area. 5

           Area of Benefit: The existing University A venue Parking Assessment District is the area of
           benefit; properties within this area receive special consideration under City parking       ·
           regulations. 6 . Specifically, the parking facilities specially benefit commercial properties and
           employment centers within the downtown as a result of the comprehensive planning and
           zoning work undertaken after the 1984-1986 Downtown Study.7 This study focused on
           mitigating growth and traffic impacts. However it acknowledged the importance ofretail
           vitality and economic health for the commercial segment. 8 The Downtown Study includes a
           "Twelve Point Public Parking Program" which specifically focuses on working with
           empl<;>yers to implement program goaJs. 9

          The South of Pores~ Area (SOFA) is relatively close to some of the parking facilities in the
          University Avenue Assessment District system including Lots E and .G and Civic Center
          Garage. However properties within the SOFA are not given unique treatment within the
          Zoning Code. Parking provided by University Avenue Facilities may not be used to offset
          parking requirements for properties in the SOFA; hence this area does not receive special

          benefit from the proposed parking ~arages.

          Facilities providing 11 Special Benefit": The proposed R Garage provides only special
          benefit. This structure, when constructed, will be utilized solely to meet parking requirements
          and demands in the University A venue Assessment District. The lot may not be used by other
          property in the, City to offset parking requirements. All cos~s and facilities associated with the
          R Garage a,re intended solely to provide additional parking for the University A venue Parking
          Assessment District in accordance with the City,s design requirements and Mitigation
          Measures adopted for the project under the California Environmental Quality Act.

          The proposed SIL Garage al.so provides special benefit because it also incJudes parking spaces
          that will be utilized solely to meet the demands and requirements of the University Avenue
          Assessment District. All costs. and facilities associated with parking at the SIL Garage are
          intended to provide additional parking for the University A venue Parking Assessment District
          in accordance with the City's design requirements and Mitigation Measures adopted for the
          project under. the California Environmental Quality Act. Costs and facilities that are
          incorporated within the SIL Garage but that do not provide parking, do not provide special
          benefit.

          F,acilities Providing "General eenefit;': The design of the SIL Garage includes a space
          dedicated for future commercial or public use. These facilities can be logically incorporated
          within the desigil on the site because of site geometry and setback requirements. This logical
          architectural and engineering design provides for construction economies. However, these
          facilities do not provide parking, hence they do not specially benefit the property within the
          Assessment District. The cost of constructing these general benefit facilities is not an eligible
          cost within the Assessment District. Any and all costs associated with this genera] benefit
          space will be paid by the City of Palo Alto, either as a contribution to reimburse the
          Assessment.District or.through a separate funding source.

APPORTIONMENT FORMULA

Method for Allocating Costs to the Assessment District

The costs for the R Garage wil1 be fully allocated to the Assessment District. The costs associated
with the SIL Garage will be fully allocated to the Assessment District. The planning, design,
construction management, administrative qr construction costs of the non-parking space attached to
the SIL Garage wiIJ not be allocated to the Assessment District and are not included in this report.

Method for Allocating Costs within the Assessment District

The City currently utilizes a blended rate of 1 parking space for 250 square feet of developed floor
area (frequently expressed as· 11250 or 4/1000) to calculate parking demand within the
Assessment District. The blended-rate is justified based on the mixed-use nature of the area. Many
visitors park and walk to a variety of establishments within the area and City policy encourages this
type of activity.
         Basis of Benefit: Special benefit is provided to commercial properties and significant
         employers within the parking assessment district, because the availability of parking

            throughout the district allows these properties to comply with City regulations. Without
            adequate parking, property cannot develop or change use. Compliance with City regulations is
          . a special and unique benefit afforded to those properties within the Assessment District and
            not available to those properties outside of the District.

           Residential property within the Downtown Area does not receive special benefit from the
           parking facilities. The parking demand associated with residential property is very low,
           compared,to commercial enterprises and parking is provided onsite.

             The Downtown Area also includes three churches. The churches are not large employers nor
           . do they dra_w traffic and parking to the DoWJ1town Area duririg business hours. A survey of
             the three churches indicates that their primary hours of operation are limited to Sunday
             mornings and Wednesday evenings. This type of use is not the focus of the parking program
             and does not represent a significant portion of the land use within the downtown area.
             Because of their unique use and hours of operation, these existing churches also do not
             contribute to the parking deficit downtown and will not receive special benefit from new
             parking facilities.

            Quantification of Benefit: The City, through its Parking Ordinance 10 has established a
            variety of parking standards for different types of commercial and industrial land uses. These
            range from requirements as high as 1 space per 150 square feet to as low as 1 space per 400
            square feet. The 1/250 standard represents an "average" demand, between the two extremes.
            Based on this information, and the City's long history in the University Avenue Area, a
            Parking Benefit Unit of four spaces per I 000 square feet is reasonable.

            In some cases, properties located in the University A venue Area provide parking on site.
            Properties with on-site parking with have their Parcel Benefit calculation adjusted to give
            appropriate credit for on-site parking provided the parking spaces provided meet the design
            criteria outlined in the City's Municipal Code.

            The benefit formula can be mathematically expresseq below:

For Residential Properties: Parcel Benefit (in PBU) = 0

For existing Churches that do not ordinarily place large parking demands during peak business hours:
Parcel Benefit (in PBU) = 0

For Existing University A venue Parking Facilities: Parcel Benefit (in PBU) ::::O

For All other Parcels:

Parcel Benefit (in PBU) 11 = (Enclo~ed square footage on a Parcel) x (4 PBU/l,OOOsf)-(onsite parking provided)
Assessment Rate (in $/PBU) = (Project Cost)/(Total PBU in District)                   ·

Thank you for taking this courageous step.
By doing so, you have greatly increased
opportunities for securing sites which are suitable for affordable housing. I applaud your actions!

Presentation to the Palo Alto City Council on Affordable Housing Overlay zone.

Ad Hoc Affordable Housing Overlay Committee: Przemek Gardias, Doria Summa, Asher Waldfogel

Through a series of interviews over a very short period of time with affordable housing providers,
market rate developers and community members we have observed that:

    1. Affordable housing development below 60% AMI and above 60% AMI are in different financing
       markets, have different financial hurdles and metrics and need different solutions.
    2. Under 60% AMI projects must cost under $500K per door to compete for limited tax-credit
       financing.
    3. Affordable housing providers believe they do not need to provide parking above .5 spaces/unit,
       but cities may finance additional parking based on demand studies.
    4. Actual parking demand in affordable units is between .5 and 1.3 spaces per unit in Palo Alto.
       Parking standards need to meet actual demand.
    5. Retail space does not qualify for tax-credit financing.
    6. Affordable housing projects that retain retail will need additional sources of funding and/or
       zoning concessions.
    7. Existing PAMC development transitional height standards limit building heights to 35 feet within
       150 feet of residential districts. This is a concern, particularly along the El Camino Corridor.
    8. Affordable housing providers want more certainty in the development process. A general
       process that requires site-specific zoning changes does not meet their needs.

Here are our recommendations:

RECOMMENDATION 1: We recommend the City pursue a development agreement with PAH to advance
the Wilton Court project. We believe a serious negotiation over the Wilton Court project will inform how
to write a better city-wide ordinance.

Despite a lack of a dedicated motion, there has been uniform PTC support for the Wilton project. The
project may proceed under the PTC zone or the development agreement.

RECOMMENDATION 2: We recommend separating affordable housing into two work items: under 60%
AMI (AH60) and 60% to 120% AMI (AH120).

Per the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annual publication on Low Income
Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), the annual median income (AMI) levels are set for projects financed with
tax-exempt housing bonds. The highest AMI is 60%.
From PAH Danny Ross' email: [PAH] [..] development projects generally have a mix of income levels up
to, but not exceeding 60% AMI. For [..] Wilton the majority of units will be in the 50% to 60% AMI range.
Deeper affordability hurts the cash flow, and without vouchers lower AMI units would make the project
infeasible.

RECOMMENDATION 3: For AH60 we recommend the following options for retail preservation
   I. Where retail is retained, offer a zoning (height) concession.
  II. Where affordable housing provider financing precludes retail: City or a 3rd party may participate
      in project financing, potentially in exchange for an ownership position.
 III.    As a last resort, City may waive the retail requirement as provided by the retail preservation
         ordinance.
As retail space falls off the qualified area for the State of California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit
Programs, retail inclusion lowers required project profitability. For this reason retail space financing
needs to come from government sources, including local or private sources.
To spur investment in the retail space, we would allow ground floor of 13-15 ft high and residential
floors above to go over the zone height limit.
Giving attractiveness and demand for the office space in Palo Alto, private capital may be used to fund
retail ground floor. We recommend a conditional office use (in lieu of retail) for the period of 10 to 15
years. Upon the term expiry, the ground floor would automatically add to the city retail inventory.

RECOMMENDATION 4: For AH60 we recommend City financial contributions to develop parking to meet
demand based on measured parking utilization rates of comparable properties. The City may exercise an
option to build additional parking available to the public.

Per AB 744 the parking ratio for affordable housing requires no more than 0.5 parking spaces per unit.
Excess parking is ineligible for the tax credit. For this reason additional parking needs to be externally
funded. Funding may come from the government sources, including local or private sources.
Governmental or private dollars may be exchanged into the right of use of the parking space. Thus
funded parking excess may be redirected to satisfy neighborhood parking needs, of affordable housing
tenants, of retail patrons or commuters out of the town. Expanding this idea, the city may ensure
parking supply without dedicated investment on standalone parking garages.

RECOMMENDATION 5: We recommend maintaining the transition height standards in all the C districts
adjacent to residential districts. We recommend a community process with outreach before changing
transition heights for AH60 housing.

As Chapter 18.16 of Palo Alto Municipal Code (PAMC) Neighborhood, Community, and Service
Commercial (CN, CC and CS) districts, defines development maximum heights within a distance (150 ft)
of a residential district, proposed ordinance needs to reconcile with that requirement. A dedicated
meeting with the community would identify any concerns and ensure voters' support.

RECOMMENDATION 6: We recommend an open space standard for AH60, but we recommend against
roof gardens adjacent to low density residential districts.

RECOMMENDATION 7: We recommend folding AH120 work into the Housing Workplan effort. The
regional consensus is to accomplish AH120 with inclusionary standards. We are not in a position today
to make a recommendation on the right inclusionary standard.

RECOMMENDATION for a by-right process to acquire an AH60 overlay. Although this recommendation
has not made into writing, it has been verbally iterated. Bi-right process would lower cost of AH
application and speed up the development process.

In summary, please note that in the absence of public or private investment in parking or retail, the AH
development proceeds on exclusive AH developer's terms. Such development would not be entitled to
any height concession.

requirement to provide housing opportunities [..] for all income levels.

Palo Alto City Council
Re: April 9, 2018, Agenda Item No. 7: Affordable Housing Combining District Draft Ordinance
Dear Mayor Kniss and Council Members,
The League of Women Voters of Palo Alto (LWVPA) has come before you many times to show our support
of your efforts to increase the supply of housing for all, particularly for those with very low, low and
moderate incomes.
LWVPA urges you to adopt an affordable housing overlay ordinance that will create opportunities for, and
eliminate barriers to, the development of affordable housing. The Affordable Housing Combining District
Draft Ordinance, Attachment A to the staff report, will go a long way towards that goal. However, to ensure
more affordable housing opportunities and units, we also urge you to include the following changes to that
draft ordinance. We had asked the Planning and Transportation Commission (P&TC) to include these
improvements which are reflected, for the most part, in the March 27 Minority Recommendation.
   •     Expand the scope of the combining district to include the Research Park and General Manufacturing
         Districts.
     • Include language that allows some flexibility regarding the distances from the transit corridors.
         The language, “major transit stop or high-quality transit corridor,” is too limiting and should be
         broader in scope.
     • Allow the Planning Director to approve increases in the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and height where
         appropriate, particularly in the areas around University Avenue and California Avenue.
     • Allow the Planning Director to waive the retail requirements in all districts. Retail usually requires
         more parking which is expensive to provide. Moreover, the presence of retail in an affordable
         housing project severely complicates the funding opportunities. Thus, a retail requirement may
         make an affordable housing project infeasible, even with the benefits of the combining district.
For the last two bullets, LWVPA believes that it is important to streamline the entitlement process. To do
so, the Planning Director, not the City Council, should have the authority to approve increases in FAR and
height and to waive retail requirements where appropriate.
To demonstrate that the Council is serious about meaningfully addressing the housing crisis, we urge you
to reject the majority recommendation of the P&TC. We believe the P&TC decision to not recommend at
this time any ordinance to allow more affordable housing at this time is contrary to the City Council’s
priority on housing, ignores the housing crisis and flies in the face of the housing policies in the
Comprehensive Plan and the Housing Element. With this decision, the majority turned a deaf ear to the
professional testimony of many affordable housing experts and to the compelling testimony of those
suffering from the lack of adequate housing in our city.

Thank you.

    Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, showed utter
    contempt for his agency’s core mission last month when he proposed deleting

    the phrase “free from discrimination”
    (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/ben‑carson‑hud‑fair‑housing‑
    discrimination.html) from the HUD mission statement. Yet Mr. Carson is not
    the ﬁrst housing secretary to betray the landmark Fair Housing Act of 1968 —
    which turns 50 years old this week — by failing to enforce policies designed to
    prevent states and cities from using federal dollars to perpetuate segregation.

    By its actions and failure to act, HUD has prolonged segregation in housing
    since the 1960s under both Democratic and Republican administrations. The
    courts (http://www.prrac.org/pdf/HUD50th‑CivilRightsTimeline.pdf) have
    repeatedly chastised the agency for allowing cities to conﬁne families to
    federally ﬁnanced ghettos that offer little or no access to jobs, transportation or
    viable schools. The lawsuits, ﬁled by individuals and fair housing groups, have
    forced the agency to adopt rules and policies that have been crucial in
    advancing the goals of the Fair Housing Act.

    Mr. Carson was named in such a lawsuit ﬁled last month by the nonproﬁt Texas
    Low Income Housing Information Service. The suit accuses HUD of illegally
    funneling federal money to the city of Houston
    (http://www.relmanlaw.com/civil‑rights‑litigation/cases/CityOfHouston.php),
    despite a 2017 ﬁnding by HUD itself that the city was ﬂouting federal civil
    rights laws by allowing racially motivated opposition to stop affordable
    housing projects in white neighborhoods. In a detail reminiscent of the Jim
    Crow South (http://www.relmanlaw.com/docs/HoustonComplaintFiled.pdf),
    the plaintiffs argue that Houston discriminates even at the level of ﬂood relief,
    maintaining “entirely different (and markedly inferior) drainage systems in
    predominantly minority neighborhoods, exposing the residents of those
    neighborhoods to increased risk from storms.”

    The next round of lawsuits against Mr. Carson’s HUD will almost certainly
    challenge his recent decision to suspend until 2020
    (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/upshot/trump‑delays‑hud‑fair‑
    housing‑obama‑rule.html) rules introduced under the Obama administration
    that require communities to analyze housing segregation and submit plans to
    address it as a condition for receiving billions of dollars in federal aid.
    FEDERALLY SPONSORED SEGREGATION

    Critics of the Fair Housing Act have glibly attempted to dismiss attempts to
    end segregation as “social engineering” — as if rigid racial segregation in
    housing were a natural phenomenon. In fact, the residential segregation that is
    pervasive in the United States today was partly created by explicit federal
    policies that date back at least to World War I. It is now widely acknowledged
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/opinion/sunday/americas-federally-ﬁnanced-ghettos.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fopinion-editorials&action=click&contentCol

    that the federal insistence on segregated housing introduced Jim Crow
    separation in areas of the country outside the South
    (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/books/review/the‑defender‑by‑ethan‑
    michaeli.html)where it had previously been unknown. It stands to reason that
    dismantling a system created by a set of government policies will require an
    equally explicit set of federal policies.

    The scholar Richard Rothstein exposed the roots of this shameful process in
    his recent book “The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our
    Government Segregated America
    (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/books/review/richard‑rothstein‑color‑
    of‑law‑forgotten‑history.html).” He reported that the government’s ﬁrst effort
    to build housing for defense workers near military installations and factories
    during World War I was founded on the premise that African‑American
    families would be excluded “even from projects in northern and western
    industrial centers where they worked in signiﬁcant numbers.”

    The same toxic pattern prevailed under Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, when
    the government created the ﬁrst public housing projects for nondefense
    workers, building separate projects for black people, segregating buildings by
    race or excluding African‑Americans entirely. Particularly telling is the fact
    that racially integrated communities were razed to make way for Jim Crow
    housing.

    The federal insistence on rigid racial separation found its most pernicious
    expression in the Federal Housing Administration, created in 1934
    (https://www.propublica.org/article/living‑apart‑how‑the‑government‑
    betrayed‑a‑landmark‑civil‑rights‑law) to promote homeownership by insuring
    mortgages. As the sociologists Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton document
    in “American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass,”
    (http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674018211) the
    government typically denied mortgages to African‑Americans, shutting out
    even afﬂuent black people from the suburban homeownership boom that
    remade the residential landscape during the middle decades of the 20th
    century.
    Government at all levels embraced racial covenants that forbade even well‑to‑
    do African‑Americans from purchasing homes outside of black communities.
    Cut off from homeownership — the principal avenue of wealth creation —
    African‑Americans lost the opportunity to build the intergenerational wealth
    that white suburban families took for granted. The vast wealth gap that exists
    today between whites and African‑Americans has its roots in this era.

    The argument for what became the Fair Housing Act emerged forcefully in the
    1968 Kerner Commission
    (http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/docs/kerner.pdf) report, which
    blamed segregation in large measure for the riots that ravaged the country in
    the 60s and called for national fair housing legislation. The housing law might
    well have died in committee had the country not erupted in fresh violence after
    the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968. It was
    signed into law a week later.

    The housing act put the federal government on record as supporting open
    housing and prohibiting the pervasive discrimination that had locked most
    African‑Americans out of decent accommodations and homeownership. But
    the version that passed in 1968 had been declawed — stripped of enforcement
    provisions that would have given HUD strong authority to root out
    discrimination. Nearly a quarter‑century would pass before Congress
    strengthened the law. So during that time, African‑Americans were left subject
    to the harsh discrimination the original act was supposed to preclude.

    This progressive sounding law — which requires entities that receive federal
    money to “afﬁrmatively further” fair housing goals — was consistently
    undermined by ofﬁcials of both parties who had little appetite for confronting
    entrenched segregation.

    That realization came home with particular force to George Romney, Richard
    Nixon’s HUD secretary, who initially took the law at its word and tried to
    enforce it by turning down grant applications from communities that continued
    to segregate themselves racially.

    When white communities complained directly to the Oval Ofﬁce
    (https://www.propublica.org/article/living‑apart‑how‑the‑government‑
    betrayed‑a‑landmark‑civil‑rights‑law), Nixon shut down Romney’s effort and
    eventually forced him out of government. Subsequent administrations shied
    away from enforcing the law in ways great and small — but the Reagan
    administration sold it out in an egregious fashion that angered even
    Republicans in Congress. The administration conspired with the real estate
    industry to undermine HUD’s already limited powers, brought cases that
    attacked integration programs and showed scant vigor in enforcing civil rights
    laws.

    THE NEXT FAIR HOUSING FIGHT



https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/opinion/sunday/americas-federally-ﬁnanced-ghettos.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fopinion-editorials&action=click&contentCol
4/9/2018                                                Opinion | America’s Federally Financed Ghettos - The New York Times

    The Fair Housing Act received new life three years ago when the Supreme
    Court endorsed the doctrine known as disparate impact
    (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/opinion/the‑supreme‑court‑keeps‑the‑
    fair‑housing‑law‑effective.html), ruling that housing discrimination did not
    have to be intentional to be illegal. The court reminded the country that the
    statute does indeed bar governments from spending federal money in a way
    that perpetuates segregation.

    Soon after, the Obama administration issued
    (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/opinion/the‑end‑of‑federally‑ﬁnanced‑
    ghettos.html) a long‑awaited rule that required state and local governments to
    afﬁrmatively further fair housing goals by making efforts to address the
    cumulative results of the discrimination that historically shut African‑
    Americans out of many communities.
    The common‑sense rule rightly breaks with the laissez‑faire approach of the
    past, making it clear that compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws
    means abandoning the strategy of dumping affordable housing in ghettos —
    and giving poor residents access to areas that offer greater opportunity. To that
    end, communities that receive HUD money are being asked to consider data on
    segregation and concentrations of poverty when making affordable housing
    decisions.

    The fact that Congress has not overturned the rule reﬂects a growing
    awareness on both sides of the aisle that ghettoizing poor people is
    counterproductive — and that the country has an interest in giving low‑income
    families access to areas that further opportunity. Later this month, for
    example, the House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold a
    hearing on a draft bill that would increase mobility for families receiving
    federal housing vouchers, improving their job and educational opportunities.

    The hearing is no doubt related to a widely cited Harvard study showing
    (http://www.equality‑of‑opportunity.org/images/mto_exec_summary.pdf)that
    young children whose families had been given housing vouchers to move to
    better neighborhoods were more likely to attend college and had higher
    incomes as adults than children whose families had not been given the
    vouchers. The data show that changing the circumstances in which poor
    families live can be crucial to breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty.

    This brings us back to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which was intended to
    break down the walls around the country’s ghettos so that at least some people
    could forge successful lives elsewhere. If the country keeps betraying this

    landmark law, it will continue to squander a powerful tool for reducing lethal
    concentrations of poverty and for opening the door to upward mobility for the
    poor.

I have sent this to city manager and project managers and am sending to each of you as well:



I write as a neighbor of the First Baptist Church. I have lived within two blocks of the church for 47 years, and I heartily
support the granting of a conditional use permit.

Reasons:

        The church has always been a good neighbor. The only difficult
        traffic snarls, parking issues, or bicycle safety issues I have observed
        were many years ago when the single Sunday morning service
        attendance was much larger.

        We have NO other “community center” type building in old Palo Alto —
        no public school, fire station, other church where community meetings
        or classes might be held. Surely our neighborhood can accommodate
        one public gathering spot, educational building, voting center etc.

        The inclusiveness of the church on LGBTQ and immigration fronts
        and its willingness to share space reflects the best of Palo Alto’s
        long time reputation for tolerance.

Although I may or may not be able to attend tomorrow’s meeting, I’d like my support to be known.

Subject:                          Buena Vista update


Hi Friends of Buena Vista - Here is a short update as to what is happening with Buena Vista.

I was just there - It is spring break, so lots of kids are home, full of chocolate bunnies, running around playing ball,
riding skate boards now that the sun is out. Some families are out of town visiting family and friends. The leaves are
coming out on the big Valley Oaks - some of the few big trees left on the property that was once full of big trees. We
hope for a mass tree planting there that will offer cool shade, animal habitat, relief from the asphalt while adding
beauty as part of the infrastructure upgrade that will take place. Did you know that Buena Vista is 92 years old this
year? Past time for upgrades.

In the strip mall fronting El Camino, still owned by the Jisser family, there is now a very nice coffee bar, the Baron
Barista, that (sadly) replaced Jamba Juice. It offers a good inside meeting place adjacent to BV which came in handy
when I and BV resident and Board member Maria Martinez met with a group of Stanford undergrads and grad
students a week ago. The class was focusing on diversity and housing equality issues and touring Bay Area places
they thought would enlighten them. They wanted to hear about the BV community, their and their children's
lives, residents and the wider struggle to save BV, etc. We dropped by the BV Youth Scholars Program (formerly the
Homework Club) to meet Deborah Farrington Padilla and some of the kids streaming in on their bikes or with
parents. The cats and dogs were almost as happy to see the students as the students were to see the BV pets - clearly
they missed their pets they left at home. I am always delighted to take people on tours at BV as there is so much to
learn from being there. I always insist that we meet residents, as BV is nothing without its heart and soul - its
community of people.

We met onsite Manager, Cassy Husted. She is a wonderful addition to BV. She creates a BV newsletter which
residents are invited to contribute to. News, recipes, updates, etc. There is also now an onsite maintenance person,
and Travis, a night security guard. The place is cleaner, less cluttered and the many container gardens are in Spring
growth.

As you know, the property was bought by the Housing Authority of Santa Clara Co. who then contracted
with Caritas, a non-profit that owns and operates 22 affordable mobile home parks in California to manage BV. Both
Housing Authority and Caritas are doing a good job of fitting a lot of pieces together quickly. It's a challenging time
of transition between the struggle to save BV and now stabilizing it. Caritas had to get to know the residents, hire a
good onsite manager, make needed repairs, and see that better rules and regulations were drafted, etc. Cheers for
Caritas, the BV Board of the Mobile Home Assoc. and all residents who are working together well day to day.
Longer term planning is in the works between Housing Authority and Caritas for the infrastructure upgrade and
replacement of homes, with work starting in 2020 - if things go as projected of course.

I have gotten quite a few emails asking me questions about a recent news article - will BV remain affordable to
residents, is there a crime problem there, and more. The article was confusing to many and embarrassing to BV
residents given the feedback. It came from a meeting between residents, their attorney, and Caritas. The meeting
was meant as an update to residents by Caritas of mostly ongoing matters, plus answers to questions previously
emailed by residents to Caritas. That a reporter was there was not generally known to residents, to the Board, or
Caritas till later in the meeting, so what was said in the meeting to update residents by Caritas or answer resident's
questions was expressed in a sort of "short hand" devoid of context but understood by residents because the subject
matter had been discussed at past meetings. Some of this short handed information was in the article, so here I want

to clarify some of parts so you will have a better idea of what was meant.There are other statements about finances
and affordability that seem a bit confusing or longwinded that I thought I could also clarify a bit.

- There is no drug dealing problem at BV. Residents are mortified if you, their supporters, think of the Buena Vista
community that way. That is not who they are. Drugs were talked about at the meeting as an issue. But the actual
story is that Caritas inherited this issue before and after they took over management - homeless people would sleep
in the community bathrooms, laundry room and even took over vacant mobile homes, some dealing drugs to
outsiders - it became a known "scene". The previous owner did little, so the BV Board tried to deal with it, finally
even asking to meet with the PA Chief of Police (I attended that meeting) and asking the police for help. Some was
given, but what was finally effective was when Caritas responded with a security guard. This was the drug dealing
problem referred to at the meeting. He moved the people out of the bathrooms/laundry room and vacate homes
and still needs to be vigilant to know that it is ended.

- The property will remain affordable to residents now and in the future. That was and is the promise to residents
and the legal commitment for this deed restricted property. While the financial specifics may not all be known now,
as the planning itself is in early days, all will be worked out to achieve the upgrades and improvements. This is
what Caritas and the Housing Authority are in the business of doing.

- The BV Board was invited by Caritas to draft the Rules and Regulations that will govern BV resident's in their day
to day activities. The Board continues to act as an advisory Board to Caritas which benefits both entities, residents
and management. R&R's regulate such things as where to park, speed limits, dogs needing to be on leash,
noise, unattended children, where kids play, trash, etc. Unused cars are being hauled off and parking spaces
assigned.

- An announcement made at the meeting was that eventually all homes would be replaced. I believe the homes will
not be replaced with other mobile homes, but possibly with high quality manufactured housing on a permanent
foundation, don't all look alike, and would cut down greatly on move out time by a resident. Mobile homes will not
be replaced with apartments or single family homes.

Struggle to Transition to Stability to Change.

There is much more to come for Buena Vista, much more to be worked out, so more to be known. I will keep you
informed. But for now, it is transition to stability, which is a very sweet place to get to after 5 years of hard struggle
that so many of you were a part of. Residents needed you to keep the faith with them then, and they need you to
keep your faith in them now and in the future as Buena Vista moves toward change.

Subject:                        Bulbouts & roundabouts



With all due respect, these make Ross Rd and the intersections more dangerous, especially to bikes. If your
goal is to have cars totally stopped while bicyclists proceed thru roundabouts or bulbouts, then you've
succeeded. The bulbouts on Ross have just enough room for 2 cars to cross. I had to stop completely to make
sure bike riders were safe. There's no other place for them to go when cars are present. This is really shoddy.

Creating smaller access to roundabouts due to bulging street corners defies reason. Mountain View has
roundabouts in residental areas that work much better and seem safer...and have wide access to them, along
with stop signs to make right of way clear if when there are multiple cars involved.

Please stop construction in PA and perhaps reverse some of the damage that's been done by de-constructing
these hazards.

Sincerely,
Marie & Don Anthony

Message read to: Palo Alto City Council,
at its semi-open meeting Apr. 9, 2018:


Prior to 2014 the airplane landing system at SFO worked superbly and displayed no major
fault. During that same year, despite only small increases in air traffic, there was a huge
jump in disturbing airplane noise. That coincided with adoption of Nextgen, although the
public was then not consulted or even informed that changes were occurring,
Adverse reaction to the changes surfaced despite the attempted silence, and it led to formal
hearings, via the “Select Committee”. This committee seems to have felt that its primary
objective was to act as public relations agent for the FAA.
My assertion is supported by the emphasis the committee put into its report, that it could
not consider return to pre-Nextgen procedures, on the ground that the FAA had informed
them it was “required by law to adopt new and advanced technology”. (Sec. 2.17)
I can imagine Congress authorizing new technology, but the thought of them requiring it
stretches my imagination. And it seems not to have occurred to committee members to ask
why the earlier system should be less suited than is Nextgen to advanced technology. What
motivated the Committee to defer to and even display with emphasis such unclear, sloppy
and misleading language?
The FAA has made ghastly blunders, and what they apparently fear most is having the
blunders exposed. They have been temporizing with us, manipulating us and giving us a
classic runaround. They have been distracting our attention with the objective of having us
overlook crucial legal deadlines. That happened to Georgetown, please don’t let it happen
to us.

Hi, I am just writing to express my concern for the new concrete bulbouts. I find it hard as it is to avoid the bicyclists on
our streets while driving. The idea of partially merging with the bike lane at some of these new constructions is puzzling.
And scary.

So, scary puzzling.And that’s the worst kind of puzzle.

Thank you for your consideration

I ride my bike every day down Ross Road from Loma Verde to Moreno and then to the frontage road. I am 79 years old
and I can state unequivocally that I have never seen a more dangerous situation than the cement narrowing sections on
the Ross Road bike boulevard I have to navigate every day. Adding more speed lowering bumps is a great idea, but the
cement narrowing sections are just accidents waiting to happen. Cars just do not care about bikers trying to navigate
those narrowing sections, I have been passed a couple of times so far by autos from behind that did not yield to my bike
while trying to go through those sections. I am opposed to building any more of those narrowing sections on Moreno
and Louis Road and support eliminating them on Ross Road.

Zug, March 14, 2018



Dear Ms Kniss,


I am writing to you in my capacity as mayor of the city of Zug, Switzerland.


The city of Zug is the Capital of the Canton of Zug, a community of approximately 125'000
residents, located in the greater Zürich area and one of the most populär areas to live and do
business in Switzerland.


Zug may be a small city with 30'000 inhabitants but more than 125 nationalities are represented,
giving it a vibrant and cosmopolitan atmosphere. With its spirit of openness, very business-
friendly mentality, the city and the canton of Zug have attracted numerous foreign Companies.
Since 2013, the canton of Zug has become a hub for FinTech start-ups with investors flocking to
the region. Since then, Zug has also been known as the Crypto Valley.


Both town and canton have been focused on extending its infrastructure with forward-looking
projects: particularly in the education, "Circulago" (energy), health, geriatric care, leisure and
sport sectors, as well as on supply and disposal issues. Furthermore, the citizens of Zug have
adopted a populär initiative to establish the values of a 2000-watt society in the long term. The
interim goal is to reduce C02 emissions to two tons per person/year and energy consumption to
3500 watts by 2050.


Zug's economic success is reflected in the canton's rapid growth in employment and population.
However, this steep growth trajectory also brings challenges for the future: affordable
apartments, public transportation, urban plan, etc.


A member of the city of Zug Parliament and an independent Lawyer, Dr. Martin Eisenring with
his family will be visiting your city and the region of Silicon Valley from mid-April tili mid-July
2018 to maintain and expand his Professional network. He will also organize presentations in
Cooperation with the renowned law firm Hopkins & Carley.




                                                   www.stadtzug.ch                               Seite 1 von 2
Dr. Eisenring's long-term goal is to build a bridge of collaboration and exchange between the
Silicon Valley and the Crypto Valley.


We believe that the canton of Zug and the city of Palo Alto share similar challenges (e.g. high
land prices, high capacity utilization of public transport, digitization, etc.) and we would be very
pleased if you would find the time to meet Dr. Eisenring during his stay.


If you or a member of your team are interested in such a noncommittal first meeting, which I
hope very much, I kindly ask you to contact Dr. Eisenring directly. Please find his contact data on
the attached CV.


Thank you for your consideration and Dr. Eisenring looks forward to hearing from your office.

If you are lost in the wilderness, you have three concerns: food, water and shelter. Of the three, shelter is number one.
A lot of people don’t know that. I think this has something to do with why the subject is so very important.

I’ve listened to council debates on development for decades; most of it intelligent, dilligent and thorough. Sometimes
the developments work, sometimes they don’t and darned if I can tell why. All I know is most of the time council does
it’s best and that you all work really hard. Keeping the good thought that the zoning modification gets the results it is
intended to.

I applaud the passage of the new AH Combining District ordinance! You heard those of us who have spoken again and again in
favor of such an ordinance, and you did the right thing for our city.

I could not stay last night for all the speakers and all the discussion so I was very pleasantly surprised to see, in the Palo Alto
Online article, that you also asked Staff to look into "including moderate‐ and high‐density residential zones, RM‐15 and RM‐
30, respectively, in the new combining district.” Expanding AH‐qualified zoning to areas that are already high‐density would be
a great addition to the ordinance.

Let’s get started!

Hello! Happy National Library Week!

The Palo Alto City Library is in the process of updating the Strategic Plan, for 2018‐2021. This draft was reviewed by the
Library Advisory Commission, and based on their recommendation, the draft plan is now available to the community for
their feedback. Please look at the plan and, as a library stakeholder, please send comments to Gayathri Kanth, Assistant
Library Director at Gayathri.kanth@cityofpaloalto.org to be considered as we finalize the plan.

A library customer survey has also been included in the Strategic Plan draft
survey. A separate survey on technology needs in the Library will be conducted in the fall of 2018. The survey will be
available from April 8 ‐ 21. Here is the link:

https://library.cityofpaloalto.org/customer‐satisfaction‐survey/

Please encourage community members to participate in the survey.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I wanted to send a note in strong support of the proposed chapter 18.30(J) that is up for discussion at tonight's
city council. I live in Evergreen Park, would be less than a block from some of the proposed overlay zone, and
am still firmly in favor of reducing impediments to building housing (even better if that housing is affordable).

First, adding additional housing that supports people at a variety of life stages and income levels creates a more
vibrant, close knit community.

Second, the larger retail areas proposed here are perfect for building higher density, less car reliant housing that
is symbiotic with the commercial aspects of those zones. Encouraging residential development in the Stanford
Shopping and Town and Country areas is great.

Third, encouraging residential development along the University and Cal Ave corridors is even better. These are
both neighborhoods that are perfectly livable without cars, extremely convenient to a wide range of jobs, and
create an opportunity for people who work here to live here.

If anything I'd like to see a more permissive version of this measure that expands beyond the flagged
commercial zones.

To Whom it may concern:

My name is Taylor Veach and I am a Masters in Social Work student at San Jose State University. As part of one of my
assignments, I am looking to schedule a quick meeting with any member of city council (10-15 minutes) to discuss my concern
on the suicide rates in the youth population in the city of Palo Alto. I am wondering if you have any availabilities for early April?
Preferably the afternoon of April 9th, or anytime April12th?

Thank you very much,

Taylor

Dear Councilmember:

       Allowing a school, already over-enrolled for the last 15 years, to further expand and further alter
       my neighborhood, does NOT equal supporting women’s education.




       And opposing a further grab on the part of the school does not equal opposing women’s
       education. The inference of Castilleja’s signage is offensive.



       Over the 34 years we have lived next to the school we have seen it go from a boarding school to
       a school attended by day students, many of whom appear to have cars of their own to drive
       themselves to and from school. My family has seen the second block of Melville (yes, there was
       a second block of Melville) go from a quiet cul de sac where my children played and learned to
       ride their bicycles to part of Castilleja! Like magic, it just disappeared one day. Don't let this
       happen again to this little residential neighborhood. Why does Castilleja merit special
       privileges, special considerations, to over-build on their small lot?


Sincerely,


Marie Macy

                Downtown Streets Team recognized as California
                  "Best Practice" model to end homelessness

            The League of California Cities is encouraging communities to
            replicate DST's innovative model in their local neighborhoods.




            "Our Homelessness Task Force spent more than a year looking at some of
            the best local programs that are helping people transition into supportive
            housing," said Darby Kernan, Deputy Executive Director for Legislative Affairs
            at the California State Association of Counties.

            "Downtown Streets Team is one of those programs that is helping people get
            off the streets and address the root cause of their homelessness, too."

            See the full Homelessness Task Force Report here!




            KNOW THE FACTS:
            The average annual public cost of a "persistently homeless individual" is
            $83,000.

            By comparison, it costs Downtown Streets Team $14,600 to help someone
            move into housing and employment.

            Homelessness is an experience, not an identity. At DST we believe that
            through collaboration, partnership, and building strong communities, we can
            end homelessness. We believe it because we see it happening!

            Join the movement to end homelessness through the dignity of work.

                 J2H RATIOS - PART 2

           Dear Readers,


           Our last issue featured the Brisbane
           and Santa Clara paradoxes. This week we move you to South San
           Francisco and Cupertino. Once again our theme is Anti-Gravity
           Economics known as J2H ratios.

                                              Anti-gravity hiding in plain sight

                                              “The Bay Area is defying gravity,” said Director of
                                              the UCLA Anderson Forecast. Another UCLA
                                              economist reported our the region “is the most
                                              dynamic, most robust metro area.” Good news
                                              weighed must have heavily upon the audience.

                                              All economists always hedge; so here are their other
                                              perspectives. “Too much retail…too many retail
                                              jobs.” “Tech jobs more volatile than non-tech.”
                                              “Expensive housing market…perhaps the greatest
                                              peril.” “Tech boom could create a wider chasm
                                              between economic haves and have nots.”

                                              Topping it off Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said, “We have
                                              economic bifurcation…..Palo Alto versus East Palo
                                              Alto…Tenderloin versus the Marina District….two
                                              different worlds in one city.”

           Indigestion

           Cupertino’s jobs/housing ratio is swinging into full debate in
           Cupertino. Here is a good glimpse of what is evolving.
           SFChronicle

           Ed Comment: Keep your eye on an issue beyond housing
           shortages. Is anyone accountable for overall
           infrastructure? Cupertino’s fragile transportation infrastructure
           is just one example of the Peninsula’s indigestible job growth.

                                                  Digging for housing

                                                  A development company proposing a transformative
                                                  project along Oyster Point in South San Francisco is
                                                  backing away from housing. Why?... Pushback from
                                                  the local biotech industry.

                                                  up their shells for housing at Oyster Bay? No, they
                                                  seem to be clamming up for housing.

                                                  We are looking for better leadership and better
                                                  trends, but Oyster Bay plunged us into murky
                                                  waters. To paraphrase The Rime of the Ancient
                                                  Mariner, “Housing, housing everywhere but not
                                                  a home to buy." For the record, we think South
                                                  San Francisco and its bio-tech titans have some
                                                  explaining to do. There is no plausible evidence that
                                                  housing supply can catch up with the number of jobs
                                                  being created by short-term focused CEOs. If a bird,
                                                  any bird, even an albatross, leads us out of the
                                                  housing jam, we will praise the bird.

           Chilled out?

           Sen. Wiener’s bill was chilled by San Francisco Board
           of Supervisors. This polarizing bill “that would force
           California cities to allow taller apartment buildings by
           BART stops and other transit hubs has been
           pummeled with opposition from local officials.”
           “….San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to
           oppose Wiener’s bill, joining smaller cities such as
           Lafayette, Cupertino, Palo Alto and Milpitas. A week
           earlier, the Los Angeles City Council took the same
           stance, unanimously, with one councilman calling the
           legislation “insanity.”

           Ed. Comment: SB827 and other related legislation
           will be in active committee debate by state
           legislature dominated by one party. These bills
           challenge conventional economics. And they would
           alter balance between state and local
           government. Our prediction: Profound and
           interesting test of government. What does Wiener
           really want?

                                                  Whom to trust?

                                                  Google’s former motto “Don’t Be Evil” resides in the
                                                  minds of thousands of Google employees. Over
                                                  3,000 employees signed a protest letter highlighting
                                                  Google’s involvement with a Department of Defense
                                                  project. The letter stated “We cannot outsource the
                                                  moral responsibility of our technologies to third
                                                  parties. Google’s stated values make this clear: Every
                                                  one of our users is trusting us. Never jeopardize
                                                  this. Ever. This contract puts Google’s reputation at
                                                  risk and stands in direct opposition to our core
                                                  values.”

                                                  Ed. Comment: Internalizing corporate ethics could
                                                  be the best cure for pain felt by some of our Tech
                                                  Titans. Google may need two slogans. “Don’t be evil”
                                                  and “Do the right thing.” If one smart slogan is
                                                  good, then two should be better.
                                                  If Google needs government business, we suggest
                                                  knocking on the door of the EPA.


           156 Mayors come clean on green

           Climate change seems to be one of the
           foremost concerns for U.S. mayors: Eight out of
           10 said it was important that their cities to
           address the issue. But roughly half view the lack
           of funding as the most significant barrier to
           making progress on this front—more than
           political opposition at the state and federal level
           and lack of public support.
           CityLab

           Ed comment: Mayors can’t turn green without
           green in their pockets. Many of us fret about
           the environment, EPA and future generations;

           however, this survey of mayors is most
           revealing. The road to hell is paved with good
           intentions.
           Nowhere in the US is lack of transportation
           infrastructure more severe than the Peninsula
           and we see job creation outpacing any solutions
           for transportation infrastructure. We are in the
           same boat as the 156 mayors….searching
           blindly for sources of funding. One thing is
           obvious: Traffic congestion will get worse
           before it gets better…if ever.

To whom it may concern,

I am currently an employee working in downtown Palo Alto and have a major issue with the Zone 5 Parking
Decal. I have been in contact with Jarrod Young, Assistant Manager SP+ and Mark Hur, Parking Opertions
Lead in Planning & Community Environment-Transportation. Jarrod has been very helpful and understanding
but Mr. Hur's responses have been far from satisfactory and have not helped nor solved the issue.

I am writing to you because Mark Hur stated that:

"Program design and enforcement were reviewed and approved by City Council in the Administrative Guidelines back in
2015, which states:



       Other Policies



       5. The permit must be affixed on the outside of the rear windshield driver’s side lower left corner,

       or left side of the bumper. Do not place your permit in any other location. Placing your permit in

       another location or behind tinted windows shall invalidate your parking exemption."


I have a sticker decal for Zone 5 but I do not want to affix it to the outside of my new car which is the only
option allowed in the RPP program. Under city policy, sent to me by Mark Hur, I can not tape the permit to the
inside of my car (driver side). Even though, an attendant can visibly see and scan the permit through the
windshield. Before receiving my permanent decal, I had a Temporary Permit, which was placed on the driver
side dash and not a single issue resulted from this. Regarding the placement of the new permit, I received a
citation on Friday, "violation of posted RPP Permit", in the amount of $53. And on Monday I received an
"Informational Warning". I would have expected the warning before the citation. This makes no sense and I
have contested, ticket number R100034514.

City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 4/9/2018 1:39 PM
In his response to my initial outreach, Mark Hur wrote, "As an alternative, we offer transferable hanging
permits at an additional cost". The cost for the hanging tag permit is $365, making the "additional costs" $315-
more than 6x I paid for the decal! This is not a reasonable option to propose.

For a lower income employee, I can not afford to spend $365 for a six month permit. There is simply no excuse
or justification to charge someone this much money to transfer the permit over. A hanging permit (at a nominal
fee) would be a reasonable solution to what I feel should not be such a contentious, complicated and time
consuming issue.

I also have a co-worker who can not fix his decal to his vehicle because it is prohibited in his lease agreement.
Additionally, my manager, Stephanie Wansek, has also spent time communicating with the SP+ administrators
and Mark Hur. I will attach my communications with Mark Hur and my manager's communications as well.

I want to thank you for your attention to my issues stated in this email.

Dear City Council Members and City Staff,

As you know, CARRD has been advocating for a more regional approach to grade separations given that the
Caltrain corridor has been identified as a main economic generator for the State and the emerging connections
between Caltrain and other rail systems. Now more than ever, we believe the City needs to take a more
aggressive approach on this issue. This week, both the CA senate and assembly Transportation committees
discussed the importance of having a cohesive and coordinated plan for funding and building grade separations.

Highlighted below highlight are comments from the recently released HSR Peer Review Group and the recent
State Rail Plan that emphasize this approach.

Attached is the latest comment letter from the legislatively mandated California High Speed Rail Peer Review
Group regarding the Draft 2018 HSR Business Plan. The letter describes that the HSR project is essentially at a
turning point where the Governor and the Legislature must make a decision about what to do given the lack of
funding to connect the Central Valley segment to the Bay Area and then to LA. Whether the program continues
or not, there are still impacts for the Peninsula.

On page 5, the Peer Review group discusses the issue of freight on the Peninsula. (Bolding, underlining and
highlighting are mine).

Interaction with the Bookend Operators

The Authority has decided to expand the blended operations with Caltrain from San Francisco to Gilroy, and
with Metrolink from Burbank to Anaheim, an approach that we consider appropriate both because of limited
funding, and because this will have significant immediate benefit to current riders. This approach underlines
the need for a clear and fully agreed upon set of operating agreements with the two agencies and with the
Union Pacific and BNSF railroads. The existing memoranda of understanding have launched the process,
but the Authority should move as quickly as possible to convert the general understandings into specific
agreements on ownership, rights of access, costs of access, maintenance responsibility, and dispatching and
scheduling decisions, among others. The Authority has already seen how negotiations of final agreements with
freight railroads tend to increase estimates of cost and schedule. Any added impacts of these agreements with
the commuter operators and the freight railroads should be identified and managed as soon as possible.

At the last Rail Committee, CARRD recommended that the City ask the new consultant to provide estimates on
what other project (and subsequent cost ) alternatives are available if there was light freight or no freight instead
of heavy freight on the Caltrain line before the city eliminates alternatives. (see pg 8 of attached CARRD
                                                          1
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 4/9/2018 1:28 PM
comment) Analysis generally shows that heavy freight has significant impacts on the grade separation
alternatives, construction impacts and relative costs. By directing the consultant to explain the impacts and
ballpark the construction impact and cost differences, the City would have quantitative and qualitative
comparisons for use by the City Council to decide which alternatives should be studied in more detail.

To date, at a State level, there has not been any specific information available to decision makers to evaluate the
impacts of low use, heavy freight operations on the Peninsula's critical passenger rail system. By providing
analysis at this critical juncture, the City of Palo Alto has the unique opportunity to help inform the State's
decisions directly. The Peer Review Committee's comments are clearly encouraging decision makers to focus
on this issue ASAP, which means the City should move expeditiously if it seeks to influence the process.

On page 6 of the letter, the Peer Review group makes it clear that the State should play a role in helping plan for
grade separations on the Peninsula. (Bolding, underlining and highlighting are mine).

Grade Crossings

In prior letters we urged that a broad program of grade crossing elimination be developed. The dangers of the
interactions of heavy highway traffic and dense, high-speed, conventional and commuter rail passenger traffic
moving through rail/highway grade crossings cannot be overstated. Now that the Plan envisions operation over
grade crossings in the San Jose to Gilroy area and plans for joint operations over the grade crossings in the
Burbank to Anaheim territory, the need for a program to eliminate grade crossings is even greater. This is not
a problem that the Authority alone can or should solve. Resolution will be expensive, it will take time, and
there may well be a need for prioritizing of funds by crossing exposure and acceptance of interim
solutions. Local governments, the state, Caltrain, Metrolink, the freight railroads and federal authorities all
have roles to play. A coordinated program over a reasonable period of time to reduce the danger at grade
crossings should be developed and implemented. The Legislature may want to request that Caltrans take the
lead in forming such a program.

The State Rail Plan released last year, for the first time clearly articulates the State's goals regarding
statewide planning and coordination for freight and passenger rail. Page 111 of the State Rail Plan has
identified grade separations as an "immediate deficiency" and explains that in order to continue to support the
growth of the Caltrain corridor, investment in grade separations should be considered. Similarly, on pages 149-
150, the plan identifies the following areas for further consideration:
       Complete study of the Dumbarton alignment to connect the Peninsula and East Bay within a
          regional network, including alternatives for both Integrated Express Bus and Rail service.
       Study to address alternatives for meeting capacity needs through Niles Canyon and across
          Altamont Pass to support growing freight and passenger train volumes as part of a regional
          network.

Both of these areas of study could impact the freight traffic along the Caltrain corridor and thus impact the
choices for grade separations. Page 157 describes Service Goals and Improvements for the SF Bay Area,
specifically:
       Improve San Francisco to San Jose corridor capacity through first phase of investments in
          grade separations, grade crossing improvements, and level boarding at priority locations.
And describes that analysis is need to:
       Plan for full grade separation and level boarding on corridor between San Francisco and San
          Jose to improve corridor capacity and safety by 2040.
       Assist communities throughout the East Bay, South Bay, Peninsula, and Tri-Valley in better
          connecting transit systems to rail, and enhancing station area functions.
      

                                                         2
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 4/9/2018 1:28 PM
Note that in the attached CARRD comments (pg 10-11), we advocated for Station Area Planning to be included
as part of Palo Alto's criteria since we believe it offers a critical opportunity to attract additional funding from
State and regional partners. The State Rail Plan and the SPUR report we cited in our comments support this
position.

There are 42 remaining grade separations between San Francisco and San Jose that need to be grade
separated or eliminated (and more if we consider crossings to Gilroy). In order for Caltrain to run a robust
system in the future the entire corridor will require separations.

We would like to reiterate our recommendation that the City should be working more closely
with Caltrain, Stanford, legislators, CALSTA and the State Rail Plan officials to develop a funding and
planning strategy for grade separations along the Caltrain corridor. A patchwork of funding sources will likely
be needed to weave together a strategy for funding grade separations in Palo Alto, thus we would urge the City
to use our lobbyist in Sacramento to work on this specific issue at this critical juncture.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Nadia Naik

Dear Honorable Members:

The California High-Speed Rail Authority's draft 2018 Business Plan marks a critical decision
point for high-speed rail in California. Although the Authority's work to date is in accord with
earlier program and funding actions by the Legislature, the 2018 draft Plan highlights the fact
that there is a continuing and growing funding gap that must be addressed in order to complete
service between San Francisco and Bakersfield and eventually to Los Angeles and Anaheim in
Phase I of the system. This is only in part because costs have gone up since the 2016 Plan and
they may well continue to do so. It is also not surprising that the project schedule has slipped and
may well slip further, nor is it unexpected that compromises continue to be made with respect to
expected system performance. The table below illustrates the general magnitude and direction of
change from Business Plan to Business Plan.

***To be revised in Final 2018 Business Plan


None of the changes since the 2016 Business Plan are surprises given the history of the project
and experience with similar projects worldwide. These patterns result from the enormity and
complexity of the project and the inherent uncertainty su!Tounding it. The changes do not
necessarily reflect badly on the competence or honesty of management and many of the changes
resulted from issues that were highlighted as risks in earlier plans. T hey follow the well-
established trajectory of most mega-projects that start from a grand vision and end up,
eventually, forming a more realistic picture of the actual challenges. Public comment is likely to
focus on cost escalation, schedule changes, and mod ifications to system design, but the Peer
Review Group would like to highlight questions that are in our opinion more fundamental.

The 2018 Plan poses critical questions because it starkly underlines the need for decisions on the
future of the program. Growth in expected costs is of concern even before considering the fact
that the most complex and costly parts of the construction (tunneling, for example) have yet to be
started, and there is an inadequate and uncertain stream of money to finance the project. There
has always been a gap that will have to filled from unidentified sources, but earlier Plans held out
the hope that there would be a set of construction cost estimates, public financial resources, and
operating income projections that would elicit enough private investment to build at least a
significant operational part of the system without major additional state or federal grants or loan
programs. Our earlier comments noted that the expressions of interest from potential private
sector investors had made it clear that an added role of the state in guaranteeing the income flow
of the Authority would be needed, no matter what other sources were identified.

The Group has comments on the Plan's details attached below, but more importantly we urge the
Legislature to respond to the 2018 Plan by focusing instead on the key questions of whether the
project should proceed and, if so, what would a revamped project look like and how can it
realistically be financed? It will be essential to develop a realistic program of project finance by
revenue source and agency (local, state, federal, private) and a realistic discussion of the
predictability of funds generation.

The Authority can no longer be expected to deliver a project for which the proposed scope is not
matched by adequate and reliable funding. The Legislature will need to consider how adequate
and reliable funding can be provided if the project is to continue. The issue is two-fold: current
funding is not sufficient to complete even the San Francisco to Bakersfield section; and the
primary source of added funding - Cap and Trade - is too volatile to support monetization by the
private sector except at a high risk premium.

The 2018 Plan does not clearly lay out the Legislature's choices or the actions needed to
implement the chosen option. This increases the risk that the mismatch between the desired
outcome and available funding will continue to grow to the detriment of the project and the state.
In broad terms, the choices appear to be:
    1. End the project, pay the remaining contractor charges, retain purchased prope1ty for state
       uses where needed and otherwise sell it or return it to its former owners and scrap any
       work already done. In practice this would not be practical because the work done so far
       would have no utility and the federal ARRA money would probably have to be repaid.
    2. Complete the existing committed work in the Central Valley and provide connections to
       the existing San Joaquin service so that use could be made of the investment and the
       ARRA funding would not need to be repaid. Complete all contracted commitments to
       local authorities on the Peninsula and in the Los Angeles basin including Phase I
       environmental clearances. After doing so, end the project. This appears to be the
       minimum feasible program, though it would leave Cap and Trade appropriations unspent.
    3. Complete existing work as described above and, using Cap and Trade receipts provided
       under current policies, add improvements in electrification from San Jose to Gilroy and
       upgrade Los Angeles Union Station and the Los Angeles to Anaheim lines. Complete
       planning and engineering for the Pacheco Pass tunnels and all environmental clearances
       needed. Defer other commitments for future consideration but continue to pursue
       potential financial options such as state guarantees of the share and level of Cap and
       Trade flows. This is basically the program status in the draft 2018 Plan. If the
       Legislature chooses this approach, it may want to commission a review of the program
       before authorizing further commitments.
    4. Reconfirm the state's commitment to completion of an agreed version of Phase I as
       contemplated in Proposition IA and provide the Authority with adequate and reliable
       sources of financing to complete the project. A workable funding plan should be based
       on the understanding that the project's schedule and costs are likely to change as the
       project evolves.

In considering these options (or others the Governor, Authority or Legislature may define), the
Legislature will need to reassess the vision embodied in Proposition I A and the reality it is
turning into. If the Legislature opts to continue the project beyond the Central Valley segment
and the existing commitments to the bookend areas, it may want to request that a study be
commissioned to revalidate the role of high-speed rail in the future transport network of
California and reaffirm the priority that transportation, and high-speed rail, have in comparison
to other spending needs of the state. This would be especially important if, for example, the
Legislature considers changing the share of Cap and Trade receipts dedicated to high-speed rail.
An essential element of the study would be a full discussion of the role of high-speed rail withjn
the state 's overall rail plan and plans for highways and airports. This should also be based on
inputs from the Authority's early operator, who could provide more detail and justification for
the projections of services and financial/economic performance of the system for the options
being considered.

As stated in previous letters the PRO believes that rail passenger service, including high-speed
rail service, is important to the economic growth of the State and can play a central role in the
State's future transport network. Enhanced passenger rail service - high-speed, conventional and
commuter - will be needed in California just as it is useful in other regions of the country and
around the world. There is little doubt that better rail service can be achieved if the various
providers (not just the Authority) are given appropriate policy guidance and financial support.
Unfortunately, the high-speed rail program as it is currently defined and financed will not be able
to support the role that high-speed rail could have in the state's future transportation system.

Please let us know if you have any questions, need any further information, or would like to meet
with the Group to discuss this letter.

Sincerely,



Louis S. Thompson

                                       Detailed Comments

Early Operator
The draft Plan does not incorporate the input of the early operator recently contracted by the
Authority. The Authority states that the early operator will be asked to assess the reasonableness
of the cost estimates and ranges presented and " [w]hen that assessment is complete, this
information will be publicly available." (page 32 of draft Plan). There are a number of areas
where the input and advice of the early operator will be very important, including capital and
O&M costs, cash flows and the business model as discussed below. If at all possible, this input
should be included in the final 2018 Business Plan. If inclusion in the final Plan is not possible,
the Authority should commit to an agreed date when the assessments will be available because
the inputs are likely to have a significant impact on the project and this may affect the
Legislature's continuing evaluation of the program.

Business Model
The Authority' s discussion of its proposed business model needs better definition and
explanation in the final Plan. This is an area in which the early operator will be able to assist
based on experience with rail passenger business models elsewhere in the world. For example,
the Authority states "The rail infrastructure provider will interface with the system operator and
will be responsible for integrating other elements of the high-speed system (high-speed rail
trains, civil works and facilities) so that the system works seamlessly. The rail infrastructure
provider is intended to be a key long-term partner and also [to] be responsible for maintaining
the underlying civil works of the system." (page 27 of the draft Plan) The Authority should
elaborate on how this would actually be implemented in practice. Would there be a separate
contractor or concessionaire who would own and maintain the infrastructure and charge a fee for
use while paying the Authority a fee? How would the charges be established and regulated?
How would the various service providers interact with the infrastructure provider? There is no
single, "right" answer to these questions, and the business model need not be defined in complete
detail, but the Authority needs to present a clear and consistent concept of its business model in
order not to make decisions now that wi ll forec lose future choices.

Interaction with the Bookend Operators
The Authority has decided to expand the blended operations with Caltrain from San Francisco to
Gilroy, and with Metrolink from Burbank to Anaheim, an approach that we consider appropriate
both because of limited funding, and because this will have significant immediate benefit to
current riders. This approach underlines the need for a clear and fully agreed upon set of
operating agreements with the two agencies and with the Union Pacific and BNSF railroads. The
existing memoranda of understanding have launched the process, but the Authority should move
as quickly as possible to convert the general understandings into specific agreements on
ownership, rights of access, costs of access, maintenance responsibility, and dispatching and
scheduling decisions, among others. The Authority has already seen how negotiations of final
agreements with freight railroads tend to increase estimates of cost and schedule. Any added
impacts of these agreements with the commuter operators and the freight railroads should be
identified and managed as soon as possible.
Grade Crossings
In prior letters we urged that a broad program of grade crossing elimination be developed. The
dangers of the interactions of heavy highway traffic and dense, high-speed, conventional and
commuter rail passenger traffic moving through rail/highway grade crossings cannot be
overstated. Now that the Plan envisions operation over grade crossings in the San Jose to Gilroy
area and plans for joint operations over the grade crossings in the Burbank to Anaheim territory,
the need for a program to eliminate grade crossings is even greater.

This is not a problem that the Authority alone can or should solve. Resolution will be expensive,
it will take time, and there may well be a need for prioritizing of funds by crossing exposure and
acceptance of interim solutions. Local governments, the state, Caltrain, Metrolink, the freight
railroads and federal authorities all have roles to play. A coordinated program over a reasonable
period of time to reduce the danger at grade crossings should be developed and implemented.
The Legislature may want to request that Caltrans take the lead in forming such a program.

Schedule Trip Time Changes
Although Proposition lA required that the system be designed so that a train could run from San
Francisco to Los Angeles in 2 hours 40 minutes or less, continuing changes in plans, all of which
have reduced speeds and increased potential trip times, will make it more difficult to meet this
requirement. In past Business Plans, the Authority took the position that the ''pure run time" as
reflected in their train performance calculator results indicated that the 2:40 time could be met
for a non-stop train from San Francisco to Los Angeles, but none of the planned schedules
included non-stop service. The three-stop scheduled trip time from San Francisco to Los
Angeles was shown as 2:55 in the 2009 Business Plan (page 66, Table A), 3:08 in the 2014
Business Plan (page 8 of 2014 Service Planning Methodology) and 3: 10 in the 2016 Business
Plan (page 5 of 2016 Service Planning Methodology). It is now shown at about 3:30 in the draft
2018 Business Plan (page 5 of 2018 draft Service Planning Methodology) though we have been
informed that this will be revised in the final Plan. The proposed schedules must be consistent
with the actual demand modeling in the plans in order that the revenue and O&M forecasts will
match the conditions needed to fulfill the schedule. At the same time, the revised schedules
illustrate the risk of reduction in system performance due to added maximum speed limitations in
a number of areas.

Overall Variabi1ity
A common thread through all our previous letters has been that all of the forecasts of
construction cost, O&M costs, revenue and cash flow, and completion schedule should be
presented as having a wide range of potential outcomes. The experience gained so far has
confirmed this point, as the draft 2018 Plan states. We fully support the Authority's move to
show all projections in terms of ranges and not just point estimates.

For example, on page 18 there is a discussion of international experience with tunneling without
furnishing any information on cost experience. If the Authority is learning from international
experience, given the enormous contribution of tunneling to the cost uncertainty of the project, it
might be especially helpful to include preliminary insights about the ranges of unit costs from
these experiences as compared with the Authority's estimates. The Authority expects to build
over 44 miles of tunnels, which is likely the largest single project cost component, so a clearer
perspective on the tunneling estimates would help in building confidence the projected costs will
fall within the estimates.

More broadly, all future projections should acknowledge that costs, revenues, system
performance and completion schedules are still subject to a lot of uncertainty, even after the
various contingency allowances are applied. Any funding plans for the system should take into
account the possibility that the actual outcomes could be at the unfavorable end of projected
ranges.

Urban/Regional Development and Potential for Value Capture by High-Speed Rail
The Draft Business Plan argues (page I) that high-speed rail will contribute to resolving the
state's affordable housing problem and repeats the assertion (pages 11-12), under the heading
" Benefits to Disadvantaged Communities." High-speed rail is presented as a catalyst for infill
development and for sustainable infrastructure that can make communities safer places to live
and the Plan suggests that high-speed rail can benefit lower income communities. The Group
considers the relationships between the construction of high-speed rail and land use changes near
the stations to be a matter of enormous policy significance and notes that this issue receives
inadequate attention in the Draft. Our concern is that the claims, though potentially credible, are
not supported by evidence. It is possible, as speculated in the draft Business Plan that people
will move to lower-cost housing close to stations while working in Silicon Valley or San
Francisco. It could equally be argued that high-speed rail will bring urban sprawl to the central
valley and will replace inexpensive housing with luxury market rate development. Because of
the significance of the issue of the impact of high-speed rail on regional development, we
recommend that better and more detailed studies be undertaken before this issue can be resolved
with confidence.

Similarly, the plan mentions (page 72) the creation of a Transit and Land Use Committee that is
pursuing station area development. References appear to the possibility in the future of value
capture financing, to the creation of station area development corporations, and to interest in
federal programs such as the federal program of "opportunity zones." We do not argue with the
potential importance of these possibilities, but they are not well enough defined or established to
give us any confidence in their future role. Much more needs to be done before they can be
taken seriously as elements of system planning or finance.

Data are provided on page 5 to demonstrate that Los Angeles has a serious traffic congestion
problem (clearly true). The Authority asserts that high-speed rail will contribute to the
alleviation of that problem, even though the plan makes no commitment to initiate service in the
coming decades in Southern California and provides no analysis to show the contribution that
high-speed rail or mass transit will make in future. The Authority should consider removing this
discussion from the final Plan. Exhibit 1.3 compares travel times by automobile, conventional
rail, and high speed rail. Air travel should be added in the comparison for longer trips like those
between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

From:         CARRD
Date:         March 2018
Subject:      Comments on Initial Screening of the Master List of Ideas for the Connecting
              Palo Alto Rail Program

We appreciate the effort the city has made in trying to get as many people as possible to
engage with this topic. We offer the following comments and recommendations to help improve
public participation and the City’s process as we move forward through the elimination of
alternatives. We will go into the following points in depth, but at a high level, here is the
summary of comments and recommendations

Process Recommendations:
   1. The Rail Committee must follow their Charter and make recommendations to City Council
      before any alternatives are eliminated.
   2. The Master List of Alternatives is unclear and should include more graphics to help
      citizens understand the alternatives.
   3. Staff’s addendum to criteria requires review by City Council per Rail Charter
   4. Allow the public and City Council time to comment on the scoring methodology and how
      weighting of the criteria was used to eliminate before moving forward
   5. Technical Advisory Committee Members and Key Stakeholders should provide more
      detailed feedback on criteria, scoring and weighting of criteria, and this should be
      reviewed by City Council, before the elimination of alternatives can begin
   6. Amend the TAC to ensure domain expertise
   7. Funding Feasibility is unclear
   8. Funding/Financing paper and public comments should be reflected in a final document
      that forms the basis of the “Funding Feasibility” criteria
   9. Use a more robust system to classify and sort considerations to develop criteria and
      identify responsible parties for decision making per CSS principles

Criteria Recommendations:
   1. Criteria that incorporates Comp Plan Goals should be included
   2. Calculate the impact and alternatives of heavy freight on grade separations and related
       impacts:
   3. Station Access and Station Areas should be considered in the criteria
   4. Criteria should include recommendations from the SPUR Caltrain Corridor Vision Report
   5. Criteria should take into consideration future track upgrades that might be necessary
       (TAC should verify what’s needed)
   6. Criteria for bike/ped crossings should consider vertical height of existing tracks as well as
       circulation of bikes and cars
   7. Less tangible, value based, criteria must be developed to eliminate alternatives:

On-going Process Recommendations:
     1. Database of public comments should be made public
     2. Glossary is a helpful, please continue

given by Staff described that the “Master List” was developed in January 2018, however this list
was not made available to the public until now.

Based on the process described by the Rail Committee Charter, the “Master List of Alternatives”
which would represent “Identify Alternatives for Evaluation” in the graphic above. The “screening
of alternatives” clearly falls in the next step described as “Evaluate and Refine Alternatives.”
Before proceeding to step 3, the full City Council should be updated on what has happened in
Step 2 and they should be allowed to opine. Additionally, the public should be allowed time to
review the entire list of alternatives before proceeding to the elimination phase.

While the Master List of Alternatives is extensive, it does not include all possibilities. For
example, Alternative WVR is described as a “Citywide railroad viaduct from Menlo Park city
limits to Mountain View city limits within existing rail corridor with two new elevated stations.” A
similar variation of this alternative could include NOT building elevated stations but instead
                           Public	  Comment:	  PA	  Rail	  Committee	  Meting	  3/21/18	       3	  

using existing stations. This is not included on the list. There are multiple examples of this type
of variability that should be addressed by the public and the full City Council before any
alternatives are eliminated.

2. The Master List of Alternatives is unclear and should include more graphics to help
citizens understand the alternatives.

The Master List of Alternatives provides a technical description of a number of grade crossing
alternatives that are difficult to understand without graphics. For example, on page 11,
alternative MDA is described as “No grade separation at Meadow Drive crossing; depress Alma
Street into trench within existing Alma Street right-of-way under Meadow Drive (no connection
between Meadow Drive and Alma Street)” is very difficult for most people to understand without
a graphic representing what that would look like. The Master List also makes references to
information that is not described. For example, Alternative MDN makes reference to “potential
Section 130 project to be completed in 2020-2022” without offering any explanation as to what
that is or what it would entail. In order for the public to be able to adequately comment on the
alternatives, more drawings and descriptions should accompany the Master List of Alternatives.

3. Staff’s addendum to criteria requires review by City Council per the Rail Charter

The City Council adopted criteria in September 2017, but in this report, the Staff amended the
criteria in seemingly meaningful ways and then developed a scoring and weighting system
without any input from the City Council and/or without input from stakeholders or the TAC.
These proposed changes warrant a review by the full City Council. We would agree generally
that the evaluation criteria should be amended but this change warrants public review and full
council approval before continuing to the next step.

4. Allow the public and City Council time to comment on the scoring methodology and
how weighting of the criteria was used to eliminate before moving forward

The Staff report describes in detail the process by which City Staff took the Master List of Ideas
and then applied criteria to develop the results of the Initial Screening. This elimination process
used the criteria approved by City Council in September 2017, but added three new criteria
developed and applied by staff. From the Staff report (ID# 9052 pg 3-4): “Using the methodology
outlined below, Staff conducted an Initial Screening exercise based on the adopted Evaluation
Criteria, as well as three new criteria: 1) Estimated Community Support, City of Palo Alto Page 4
2) Constructability, and 3) Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) Opinion. Much of this scoring is
qualitative in nature and relies on the professional judgment of Staff. An internal working group
comprised of staff from the Planning and Community Environment Department, Public Works
Department, and Utilities Department coordinated on the evaluation under the technical
screening criteria.”

Unfortunately, the report explains that the detailed scoring used for the initial screening will be
distributed during the Rail Committee Meeting on March 21st. This does not provide the public or
the City Council time to review how the scoring methods were applied, how the different criteria
were weighted, and whether they would agree with the methods or results.

Additionally, “Estimated Community Support” is described as criteria used to judge Staff’s belief
that the project may have broad support within the community based on their recent community
                             Public	  Comment:	  PA	  Rail	  Committee	  Meting	  3/21/18	      4	  

  engagement activities. A better way to estimate community support is to have detailed criteria
  that encapsulate the various concerns of the community so that support for a variety of
  characteristics and goals can ultimately be decided by the City Council. For example, a tunnel
  has repeatedly been the single most supported alternative, but the community support for a
  tunnel might wane significantly if a $15,000 parcel tax per Palo Altan was proposed. And,
  without seeing the weighting of the scoring criteria, it is impossible to understand how the
  citywide trench and tunnel alternatives were eliminated given they would have scored very high
  on the “Estimated Community Support” criteria. We recommend eliminating the criteria
  “Estimated Community Support” altogether.

  5. Technical Advisory Committee Members and Key Stakeholders should provide more
  detailed feedback on criteria, scoring and weighting of criteria, and this should be
  reviewed by City Council, before the elimination of alternatives can begin

  The Technical Advisory Committee should be included in helping establish criteria. The Staff
  report makes clear that the TAC has not yet provided feedback as they have not met to discuss
  the Master List of Alternatives. However, it is unclear whether when they do meet, they will
  simply provide one metric (aka: “TAC Opinion” or whether they will further refine the technical
  criteria that might be necessary).

  Our recommendation is that the TAC be asked a series of specific questions set to elicit more
  information about whether we have the right technical criteria represented in our current criteria
  process. In addition, TAC recommended criteria should be brought to the full City Council for
  review.

  The Community Engagement Plan presented to the Rail Committee on 9/5/17 explains that “The
  Connecting Palo Alto process will bring forward input and lead to decisions that will impact a
  wide range of stakeholders so the identification of key participants is essential to a successful
  outcome.”

  This Plan identified the following participants or target audiences:
  • Palo Alto residents who live near or                     • Non-profit organizations (i.e. CARRD
      travel across the rail corridor                           and Friends of Caltrain)
  • Regular transit riders                                   • Local businesses
  • Senior citizens                                          • Local educational institutions
  • Citizens with special needs                              • Local environmental advocates
  • Low income residents
                                                             • Community-based organizations
  • City elected officials and staff
                                                             • Neighboring elected officials and staff
                                                             • Other members of the general public

We recommend the Rail Committee direct staff to obtain feedback from the identified groups to
ensure that the final criteria and weighting methodology used for scoring specifically considers key
stakeholder input. This is especially important for stakeholder groups that have had low attendance or
engagement thus far. (For example, how is the City tracking whether the needs of low income or

special needs residents are being considered in the criteria? How can we know what their needs
might be without specific engagement around this issue?)

6. Amend the TAC to ensure domain expertise.
The current TAC (as described by 9/5/2017 in Staff report 8277) was described a group that will help
“identify the technical opportunities and constraints for the various alternatives.” The TAC “will likely
only be convened on an as-needed basis moving forward. “ Our understanding is that the make-up of
the TAC is as follows:

     •     California High Speed Rail Authority                                                 •     Palo Alto Transportation Management
     •     Catrain (PCJBP)                                                                            Association (PATMA)

potential “fatal flaw.”
Funding Feasibility (Fatal Flaw)


            ✔     It’s possible that the entire project can be funded with established revenue
            sources.



            X       It’s possible that the majority of the project can be funded with established

            revenue sources, although some portion of the project will likely require new
            funding mechanisms, and that portion is likely to be eligible for competitive grant
            funding.



            X       The estimated cost of the project likely exceeds the capacity of existing

            revenue sources and potential new funding mechanisms, and the project would be
            unlikely to be eligible for competitive grant funding.

Tier 2 Evaluation Criteria

Reduce Noise
                The project will likely reduce noise from trains—air horns and roadway crossing warning
                bells—while not increasing other noise.
                               Public	  Comment:	  PA	  Rail	  Committee	  Meting	  3/21/18	          6	  

It is unclear what is meant by “established revenue sources” – is this Measure B only? Does it include
other ideas presented in the Funding/Financing White Paper? Did the public comments received on
the Funding/Financing White paper change the city’s assumptions and if so how? Etc. Again, without
clarity on what is being used for criteria and weighting, it is difficult for the public or the City Council to
agree or disagree with Staff’s analysis.

8. Public comments to the Funding/Financing paper should be reflected in a final document
that forms the basis of the “Funding Feasibility” criteria:

The Funding/Financing Paper was presented on November 29, 2017 to the Rail Committee. Nowhere
on the City’s website is it possible to view any of the public comment that was made on this
document. There were no electronic copies of public comment made available for the November 29th
report and at the subsequent meeting in February 2018, there were no electronic versions of public
comment made on the Funding/Financing report. Without this information made available, the public
has no idea what, if any, feedback was received on this report.

A rough count shows that about 25% of the comments logged at the Trenching/Tunneling meeting in
March 2018 (Staff Report #9049) related to the funding and financing of alternatives for these
projects. In order to show that the City is evaluating suggestions from the public and is seeking ways
to be creative on this issue, we recommend that comments made to the Funding/Financing paper or
in other settings related to funding, should be made public and incorporated in a public report and
their feasibility should be addressed. This would help the community see that their input is being
heard and considered throughout this iterative process. This cumulative, iterative work could then be
the basis for the “Funding Feasibility” criteria that would then be approved by the City Council.

For example, the Funding/Financing Paper only considered tax measures that last 10 years, despite
the fact that this infrastructure is considered a 100 year project, and even county tax measures last
30 years. Without Council’s decision on what is appropriate to consider in the evaluation criteria and
weighting and scoring, the alternatives should not be eliminated.

9. Use a more robust system to classify and sort considerations to develop criteria and
identify responsible parties for decision making per CSS principles

In a CSS process, concerns, constraints and criteria are developed and reviewed by stakeholders,
technical advisory committees and other relevant parties prior to their final approval. Only AFTER,
this has all been decided ahead of time, would the criteria be applied to the Master List of
alternatives.

Another important element of the process is to identify exactly what technical criteria is assumed
(before options are eliminated) and who is the ultimate owner/decision maker on the assumptions.
For example, there are technical assumptions around freight that are under the purview of
Caltrain/UPRR and others that are CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) rules. When
eliminating alternatives, it is important to show why a particular alternative failed a technical
requirement. This allows the opportunity to understand the constraint, but also to identify possible
constraints that might be more flexible than previously considered.

To offer a real world example, I’ve included excerpts from a report done by SMA for Caltrain and HSR
that analyzes capacity constraints between operational goals of HSR and Caltrain. (See Attachment
A).
                             Public	  Comment:	  PA	  Rail	  Committee	  Meting	  3/21/18	         7	  

The methodology SMA used is similar to a CSS process:

      Understand and agree upon stakeholder considerations (request clarity on vague/conflicting
      goals)
      Classify and sort considerations
      Develop evaluation criteria
      First tackle the most constrained part of the system
      Build on complexity once fundamental system constraints are satisfied

      They divided the criteria into Constraints, Needs and Wants defined as follows:

      Constraints: Stakeholder expectations that must be fulfilled by the project.

      Needs: Stakeholder expectations that must be fulfilled by the project, if the project constraints
      are not violated or other stakeholder needs are not in conflict.

      Wants: Stakeholder expectations that will be considered once constraints and needs are met
      and if they are feasible.

      If we were to apply that methodology to our grade separations project, one example might be:

      Sequence of Considerations
      Step 1: Identify and tackle the most constrained part of the system
      Step 2: Build upon concept(s) that satisfy fundamental corridor constraints to include
      additional considerations
      Step 3: Increase the robustness of the concept(s) by taking into consideration broader
      considerations that are an integral part of community concerns, but not necessary technical
      requirements

      In the report, considerations are broken into two categories for evaluation purposes:
      1. Constraints and 2. Needs/Wants

      Constraints: Either fulfilled              or not         ✖
      Needs/Wants: Ranges of goal achievement categorized Good, OK or Poor, based on
      stakeholder-defined thresholds

Page 7 of Attachment A shows an example of the chart with alternatives.

The stakeholders and their Needs/Wants are identified on the left side of the chart. This allows the
decision makers to understand what stakeholder concerns are as represented by the Needs/Wants
statements. You may notice that when there are iterations done, the chart identifies the technical
parameters used and the assumptions.

For the purposes of narrowing the range of alternatives for grade separations, we propose that the
City Staff continue using a similar methodology that specifically tracks the concerns raised by the
various stakeholder segments such as businesses, schools, Technical Advisory Committee members
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Public	  Comment:	  PA	  Rail	  Committee	  Meting	  3/21/18	     8	  

(not as a group, but each individual domain expert), City Council, etc. and also the technical
assumptions that were used when eliminating (or keeping) specific alternatives.

This improved methodology will allow councilmembers and the public to respond to each assumption
clearly and directly based on the specific information, rather than an interpretation of general and
unspecific interpretations. For example, under the Tier 1 Criteria “Facilitate Movement – All Modes”,
the report describes the achievement of this goal as: “At year of completion, the project will likely
improve access and mobility compared to a scenario with no project.” Any grade separation built
where there isn’t currently a separation will likely improve movement. But, if a crossing is closed then
“facilitate movement” is difficult to assess, especially if spill-over traffic has resulted in a new concern
elsewhere (or possibly in multiple locations). Thus, the criteria description requires further explanation
and the weighting of any scoring related to this goal must be carefully articulated and considered as
well to ensure it can be applied as intended.


Criteria Suggestions:
1. Criteria that incorporates Comp Plan Goals should be included
Palo Alto has a number of long-term vision goals expressed in the new Comprehensive Plan. When
looking at refining alternatives for grade separations, the City should look for ways to assess whether
something that might be considered a project impact could in fact be an opportunity to achieve or
hinder an indirect goal. As an example, how would the alternative of a trench or tunnel help the goal
of developing more housing? Would the associated costs of alternatives be more appealing if they
were solving more than one problem? Would the attainment of more than one goal present a
secondary funding source not yet considered? How can the City and staff incorporate this type of
thinking into the criteria categories and eventual scoring and weighting methodology?

2. Calculate the impact and alternatives of heavy freight on grade separations and related
impacts:
There were many community comments relating to freight. While the City asked the consultant to look
at the possibility of going at a steeper grade (2%), the consultant report does not explain how heavy
freight requirements impact the range of alternatives, design, cost, construction and ongoing
operation.

We recommend Clem Tillier’s excellent blog1 post about the effects of heavy freight trains on grade
separation planning. Below is a paraphrased version of Clem’s information to help clarify why
quantifying impacts of heavy freight is important.

Heavy freight requires steeper grades than electrified passenger trains. (This is the explanation for
the difference between 1% and 2% grade considerations, which this committee has heard about
extensively). When a train track is designed to go over the road (train is lifted on a berm or an aerial
viaduct), heavy freight increases the length and the area of the retaining wall that must be built to lift
the tracks. This is true for hybrid alternatives as well.

When a train track is designed to go under the road (trench), heavy freight increases the length
(requires a more gradual slope down) and increases the depth requirement because freight trains are
three feet taller than passenger trains. As Clem explains: “On a structure that is 75 feet wide and well
over a mile long, that adds up to a lot of extra dirt removal.”

Compare and contrast a typical 1% rail trench underpass with a 2.5% trench underpass:
                                                                                                                    Freight

Heavy freight trains double the amount of excavation needed for a trench.

When building aerials (bridge columns), bridge design that has heavy freight requires: bigger and/or
more concrete columns, shorter spans with columns spaced closer together, thicker bridge decks and
costlier construction.

It is possible to have freight on the corridor but not have all of the impacts related to heavy freight.
“Light freight” operates with much lighter loads and with more compact loading profiles.

   -----
Before alternatives are eliminated, the new consultant should offer their estimates on what would be
the cost differential for the various alternatives are if there was light freight instead of heavy freight to
get a range of how much cost is associated with different freight assumptions.

If, after careful analysis, it is clear that the savings in Palo Alto would be significant, the City could
then decide whether or not they would like to pursue a regional dialogue in favor of light freight.
Conversely, if the analysis shows little to no impact, then the analysis could be used to address the
community’s concerns. The topic of the effects of heavy freight on grade separations is not a new
one. It was discussed during the High Speed Rail process, at the Caltrain LPMG meetings years ago
and was a topic of constant discussion at the previous Peninsula Cities Consortium meetings. The
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Public	  Comment:	  PA	  Rail	  Committee	  Meting	  3/21/18	     10	  

conversation stalled while Caltrain funding electrification was in limbo, but now, it is again an
important issue that should be quantified and evaluated thoroughly for such an important, visionary
project.

3. Station Access and Station Areas should be considered in the criteria

Caltrain hopes to double capacity over the coming years, which means the number of passengers
getting on and off of Palo Alto stations will significantly increase. Through Transit Oriented
Development and Transportation Demand Management, the ways people arrive at the stations will
likely change, however, station area access and stations themselves should be part of this larger
conversation.

As Clem Tillier points out, “access between three important zones of activity (the University Avenue
shopping district, Stanford University, and the Stanford Shopping Center) is a circuitous and
dysfunctional jumble that is both unpleasant and time consuming to navigate, whether by foot, bike,
car or bus. Neighboring areas just a few hundred feet apart feel miles away from each other.” Clem
recommends “…it's worth considering an even wider range of options: this area could just as well be
redeveloped without any tunnels at all. Streets on either side of the tracks could be reconnected using
regular grade separations. Lytton Street could be connected to the bus depot, El Camino and Quarry
Road, improving bus, shuttle and taxicab connections at the train station.”

When considering whether or not to eliminate alternatives from the Master List of Ideas, re-designing
stations should, from a long-term planning perspective, be seen as a positive. In addition, station
access and station areas offer one of the most likely sources of potential income to help fund
improvements.

4. Criteria should include recommendations from the SPUR Caltrain Corridor Vision Report

The recent SPUR Caltrain Corridor Vision Report 2 makes several recommendations for cities to
consider when planning for more Caltrain service. The report recommends that policy makers:
upgrade stations to attract and accommodate more riders, improve station access for sustainable and
space-efficient modes of travel and proactively manage station access and first- and last-mile
connections at each rail station. SPUR suggests this could be done in partnership with: Peninsula
Corridor JPB, CAHSRA, cities along the corridor, VTA, SMCTD, San Mateo County Transportation
Authority (SMCTA), SFMTA, and SFCTA.

When scoring grade separation alternatives for elimination, the criteria recommended by SPUR
should be considered and viewed as a possible opportunity for collaboration and funding.

5. Criteria should take into consideration future track upgrades that might be necessary (TAC
should verify what’s needed):

The tracks at University Avenue station may need to
be straightened in the future to allow for faster
trains. This represents another reason that station
area improvements should be included as part of
the criteria when eliminating alternatives.
The best description of the potential track
reconfigurations is described by Clem Tillier’s blog,3
“…the entire station is offset laterally to the west of
the straight alignment of the peninsula tracks; the
northbound track is offset by 60 feet, and the
southbound track by 85 feet (see photo by ibison4).


6. Criteria for bike/ped crossings should consider vertical height of existing tracks as well as
circulation of bikes and cars.

Palo Alto’s Caltrain right of way currently varies in height greatly from one end of the City to the other.
Once again, Clem’s blog illustrates 4 this well. The below graphic illustrates the shape of Palo Alto.

Working from Caltrain track survey data, here is the shape of Palo Alto, with the vertical scale greatly
exaggerated: (view on line to expand)




Among the Master List of Alternatives for Churchill, the staff report discusses the possibility of a

a cost/constructability perspective)? The significance of this should be articulated in the criteria to
help make decisions.

Additionally, the criteria for a bike/ped crossing for PALY may be different than the bike/ped crossing
that was built for Homer given the use case (lots more hoards of students at PALY). The placement of
a bike/ped crossing perhaps should not only consider a width big enough to deal with this
phenomenon, but might also consider what streets would make sense from a circulation perspective.
For example, in Old Palo Alto, Seale is a “preferred” street for cars traveling between Alma and
Middlefield because it has less STOP signs than other streets and you can cross Middlefield and
continue on to Newell. What criteria should be developed to help measure how a particular location is
relative to another when thinking about separating cars and bikes given our existing and future road
network goals?

7. Less tangible, value based, criteria must be developed to eliminate alternatives:

NCRHP Report 4805 about best practices explains that Staff is (likely) “comfortable evaluating
alternatives based on quantitative measures like capacity, safety, design standard compliance, plan
compliance, and minimization of direct impacts to known natural resources. However, attempts to
measure issues such as ‘quality of life’ or ‘community cohesion’ will likely be more difficult.” These are
often viewed as intangible and, therefore, un-measurable, but, given their importance to stakeholders,
they must be tackled head-on. The report explains “Ignoring these just because they seem difficult to
measure sends the wrong message to stakeholders that they are unimportant.“

Including criteria that is difficult to quantify is a crucial aspect of the selection process that needs to be
included in any meaningful evaluation of alternatives. Staff and the TAC should work with
stakeholders to develop evaluation criteria for such categories to help pinpoint specific, measurable
items that capture community concerns. The elimination of alternatives will involve difficult trade-offs
and high degrees of controversy, which will benefit from the use of quantitative measures. The criteria
can help objectify the discussion and move stakeholders from strongly held positions to consideration
of specific outcomes from various alternatives. They can also provide decision makers with a
definitive rationale for trade-off decisions and alternative selection.

Seemingly subjective, value based criteria can often be quantified. For example, when weighing
construction impacts, criteria for length of time of disruption or how wide of a swath of the City is
affected or some combination thereof can be identified. The more specific we can be about the
criteria we intend to use and how it will be measured, the better.

On-going Process:
1. Database of public comments should be made public

At the last Rail Committee meeting, the staff described a large database that houses the comments
collected thus far. We would recommend either making the database public or linking to the data
received on the City’s website to allow the public to see what has been submitted. This allows the
City to reflect back to the community that their input was received and recorded. In addition, by
allowing citizens to read other comments submitted new and more creative ideas can be built on the

ideas of others. Finally, as the City moves forward, the future decisions and iterations made by Staff
and the City council will ultimately show how the community’s input helped formulate the final ideas.

2. Glossary is helpful, please continue:

The most recent staff report included a glossary of technical terms. This is an excellent idea and we
recommend continuing this process and finding a way to make an online glossary that could be used
by residents.

Under CSS principles, establishing naming conventions at the outset of the process assists in clear
tracking of alternatives and their variations. Keeping careful notes of each meeting at which
alternatives are discussed, and recording specific reasons why each alternative was either forwarded
for further evaluation or rejected, provides the backbone of this documentation.

Dear City Council,

I am writing to request that you support the Affordable Housing Overlay measure. The imbalances (wealthy
and less wealthy/jobs and housing) are obvious to anyone who lives or works in our wonderful city. The
overlay is just a small step but it’s an important one. I am hopeful that you will join with others on the Council
and lend your support to this critical measure.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Weal

General:

Housing for low-income residents is a high priority as we are far behind in addressing the human
challenges facing low and moderate income residents.

Housing for low-income residents faces funding, zoning and community challenges and steps like the staff
proposed ordinance will go a long way in signaling that housing for low-income residents is welcome in
Palo Alto.

Other specific points:
1) Support city council's housing priority and goal of permitting 300 units per year.
2) Support the original staff version of the Affordable Housing Ordinance, for 100% affordable projects serving people up to
120% AMI
3) Support proactive long term planning for the next 20+ years by enabling affordable housing on as many sites as possible
4) Affordable housing is a social justice issue - to keep our community open, inclusive, diverse, with people of all ages,
professions and abilities
5) Affordable housing is critical to achieving Sustainability & Climate goals (primarily to lower transportation emissions from
workers) We have a many lower income workers in our city and people who work these jobs shouldn’t have to drive in from
Gilroy or Tracy

       Hi Mark,

       Yes, and at least one other female member of the HRC acted and suggested, apparently not
       knowing of the long vile history of the PAPD’s discriminatory policing, and police brutality,
       think the Albert Hopkins case, the Jameel Douglas case, and many others, that this department
       was without sin. Therefore, in her view, not requiring that the PAPD to have a tight due process
       based, community supported, body-worn camera policy before, not after rolling out the cameras.

       In addition to a department with a long history of police brutality inflicted on Africa-Americans,
       Hispanic, and the poor, the PAPD has had several officers accused of sexual assault, and at least
       one that I can recall, convicted of a sexual assault. To suggest, as this same female HRC member
       did, that the PAPD does not reflect the national pattern of police abuse against people of color- is
       to be blind to the reality of this department’s long and dishonorable history of discrimination
       policing against people of color.

       Aram

       P.S. Also think the Jorge Hernandez case where he was subjected to a long and grueling
       interrogation, filled with police lies and deception, that led him to falsely confessing to a brutal
       rape of a 90 yr old plus women. After Jorge was jailed for several week, but for a DNA
       exoneration, he might still be incarcerated. So not only do we need to scrutinize the body worn
       camera policy, but the PAPD’s current interrogation practices.

Dear Superintendent Hendricks,

City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 4/11/2018 10:19 AM
        On Feb 12, 2018, my daughter was hit by a car in the crosswalk at the intersection at Churchill and
Castilleja Ave, immediately south of the Paly football field.



This intersection has been dangerous for a long time. I participated in meetings trying to find a solution in Oct
2016 after another student was hit by a car, and I was left with the understanding that a crossing guard was
not possible, but that the City Council would implement specific planned improvements.



My daughter suffered road rash, a badly sprained tendon in her ankle, and many cuts and bruises. Her
accident could have been far worse, but fortunately when her head hit the ground her helmet protected her
head. She cracked a section of that helmet all the way through. My daughter spent 3 hours at Stanford ER,
and we have been in and out of doctor’s offices ever since. The accident has had severe effects on her school
performance— you know how much homework a Paly sophomore needs to do—and it was incredibly scary.



Actions are needed to make this intersection safer for the students who face a high level of traffic, often with
no break in the flow of cars. Presently the signage and physical setup does not offer sufficient protection of
the students. There have been many discussions and proposals on how to make this busy intersection more
safe for the students and commuters who use it daily, including:



           Installing a raised crosswalk, with flashing lights

           Installing a traffic light

           Hiring a crossing guard

           Blocking traffic between Castilleja and Alma on Churchill



Please see the plans, shared with me by Councilman Dubois’s office, that have been approved since Jan
2015.
Please see a link to a descriptive slideset about the intersection.



My understanding is that the next step is for PAUSD to grant an easement [for] the CIty of Palo Alto.

           Is that correct?

           Can it be done by April 30? If not then, when?

           If that is not the correct step, please clarify what needs to happen next.

                                 Affordable Housing Overlay attachement.pdf




Dear Honorable Mayor & Council Members:

I am writing to you to support the Affordable Housing Overlay and I urge you to pass it tonight.

Although I am writing as a resident of Palo Alto, I also work as a Realtor and am intimately familiar with the housing
marketing and its affordability. It is expensive to live in the Bay Area. But how much do you need to earn to live in
the Bay Area? I took the numbers from my trade association, CAR, California Assoc. of Realtors. It is telling us that
the minimum qualifying income to purchase a median priced home of $1,270,000 in Santa Clara county is $256,450.
I challenge all of you to buy a home in Palo Alto at the median price!

Another number we look at is the Affordability index, also compiled by CAR. The index peaked at 2009 when the
economy tanked at 44%. That means 44% of people wishing to buy a home in our county can afford to buy one
back then. The index since decreased steadily into the 30’s, then 20’s. Last year in 2017, Santa Clara county’s
affordability index read 17%.

But why is that? What drives the affordability down really is the steadily deteriorating supply coupled with unmet
demand that propels the fierce competition and therefore the crazy prices we are seeing in the market. Median
sale price for a Palo Alto home was $735,000 in 2001 when a total of 593 homes were sold. Home sales peaked in
2004 when 1,020 homes changed hands at the median price of $841,000. Number of homes never picked up and
remained flat since. Fast forward to 2017, 448 homes were sold at median of $2,675,000.

More people are chasing fewer homes and unless something happens, the constraint of housing supply won’t go
away and the affordability continue to decline. As Mark Twain once said, “Buy land, they’re not making it
anymore,” recognizing the land being the most valuable commodity. I am writing to you to applaud your leadership
of the proposed affordable housing overlay ‐ quell the cost of land value by permitting for greater density of units.

This is truly what our community needs and most of you ran for the office promising affordable housing. I am so
very pleased to see the proposal on the table and the time for action is now.

Sincerely,




Amy Sung

 Dear Mayor and Council,



 The Palo Alto Local Government Committee of SILVAR has reviewed and discussed the proposed affordable
 housing combining district ordinance, and supports it as a tool to provide affordable housing and improve
 housing mobility in our community. The lack of housing inventory is something our REALTOR® members
 confront every day, and know contributes not just the high cost of ownership, but to renting as
 well. Furthermore, the lack of housing production in Palo Alto, and across Silicon Valley, has impacted
 residents of all incomes and occupations and has led to many being priced out of the communities they work or
 often grew up in.



 The affordable housing combining district provides flexibility in project guidelines and administrative review
 for dense, transit-oriented housing proposals, all residents can afford. Increasing density, reducing parking
 minimums, easing retail and other requirements when projects are proposed in the appropriate underlying
 zoning areas, will undoubtedly allow greater viability for affordable projects in this market. The underlying
 zone requirements also limit impacts to single family neighborhoods, while spurring greater use of transit
 options. This is a crucial component of addressing the housing, transportation, and environmental challenges
 our region faces, while working to achieve your goals of producing 300 housing units this year.



 Lastly, we applaud your leadership in taking proactive options to support housing development in a way that is
 responsive to Palo Alto’s needs. Efforts such as this will contribute to meeting RHNA requirements, and
 hopefully inspire others in the region to take a more proactive approach even as the state looks to take away
 your ability to do so. We urge you to adopt this ordinance, and we look forward to working with you to
 promote housing and homeownership in Palo Alto.

Subject:                        Recommended action regarding aircraft noise and health effects



Dear Council Members,

I am unable to attend the meeting and comment this evening on the actions being considered by Council related
to aircraft over our city. Since summer 2014, I have been studying both commercial jet traffic and private
aircraft over our residential neighborhoods. We have data from a sophisticated noise monitor in our yard which
confirms what we know—four years later, we have seen no relief from the noise and pollution associated with
the roughly 300 aircraft overflights per day.

What we do see is a lot of stonewalling by SFO, the airlines, and the FAA— after we patiently invested hours in
meetings of the Select Committee. Sadly, we knew the final recommendations of that committee we would not
provide Palo Altans any relief.

I encourage litigation on the part of the City, as well as greater pressure on our Congressional Representative to
hold the FAA accountable (by withholding funding) and by using legislative power to better regulate aircraft.

Regarding proposals before the City:

Noise monitors: if provided by SFO they will likely be useless to Palo Alto. What is the goal? Past use of SFO
monitors in other communities find no significant noise impact—because of the crude DNL/CNEL metrics used
to analyze the raw data. PA should require access to the raw data and supply that data to citizens to correlate
with actual aircraft overflights. Each overflight event needs to be assessed for noise impact in excess of the
ambient noise levels between overflights.

Airbus Retrofits: The FAA rejected the Select Committee’s recommendation to require the retrofit of Airbus
jets that emit a horrible whining howl as they descend over PA. They said it is not within their power to require
airlines to spend $3000 to install “vortex generators” in order to spare thousands this irritating disruption day
and night. The City should sue the airlines flying these Airbus jets over us, and require them to complete those
retrofits within a year’s time. This is simple and it would eliminate a huge part of the noise without relying on
any complicated route or procedural changes! The City could also pressure Congress to legislate this simple
equipment change, which is what they did in Europe.

Arrivals from the North, turning over PA: The “concession” by the FAA and SFO regarding the BDEGA
arrivals, which promises to maximize use of the East leg (over the Bay) vs. the West leg (over us) during
overnight hours, is not real. The east leg is not being used during overnight hours! And arrivals from the north
are not even the bulk of our overnight flights—most of which come from the south or west. Data? On April 9,
there were 37 aircraft overflights affecting our midtown home between midnight and 7 am. Only 9 of those 37
were SFO arrivals using the BDEGA route (one at 12:05 am and eight more between 5:53am and 7am) and not
one of those arrivals used the BDEGA east leg (Bay) approach to SFO! All turned over our homes at altitudes
between 3500 ft and 5300 ft. en route to SFO. The bulk of last night’s disturbances (28/37) were from other
routes: the South (10), West (14), or GA to SUMC or SQL(4). What we really need is a nighttime curfew at
                                                         1
City of Palo Alto | City Clerk's Office | 4/11/2018 10:14 AM
SFO and Oakland, or barring that, altitude minimums of 6000 ft over homes during overnight hours. More City
pressure on Congress and the airports?

The Elephant in the Room: How is it that PACC and City staff refuse to acknowledge the contribution of PAO
and SQL to our noise problem? Those 60+ GA noise events each day are louder and more polluting per over
fight. The City is using our tax dollars to prop up PAO, so we pay for the privilege of being hammered with
noise in our homes, at the Baylands Park and at all open space parks along the peninsula. This is not a
“sustainable” operation and yet the City chooses to ignore the airport’s carbon and pollution impacts. What can
you do to minimize the PAO impact on our communities? How about hosting a conversation with the residents
about PAO?

Thank you for considering actions that will actually help alleviate aircraft disturbances and the associated health
risks.

Sincerely,
Amy Christel
Midtown PA

Dear Sir or Madam:

Can someone show me the data on how Ross Road is safer now that you’ve removed a great deal of parking on the
street, forced cars closer to bicycles, and added pillow speed bumps that only encourage cars to drive down the center
of the street?

I have lived on this street for 40 years. I’ve biked and driven on this street for over 30 years. I have consulted in human
factors to the US Military via a top military contractor and been a Director level consultant to one of the big three auto‐
makers where in part my focus was on safety.

I await your reply.

Best,

Soudy

Dear City Council Members

The bulb outs and round abounds recently installed on Ross Road are an absolute danger both to bikes and cars. These
ideas are completely misconceived. Round abouts are very effective where space is very generous but that is not the
case on these intersections on Ross Road. Making Ross Road a bike boulevard is also misconceived as Ross is a dead end
street at Oregon.

I attend the YMCA 3 days a week and travel on Roos. The north entrance to the “Y” Is dangerous especially after dark.
These bulb outs make driving very difficult to enter the parking lot not to mention at a time of day when many school
children are biking to school.

The community is outraged about these changes i.e. the number of letters written in both papers and on line. I do hope
these problems can be remedied as soon as possible.

Members of the Council,

The Ross Road bulb-outs are a huge nuisance, and, I think, dangerous for bikers, not protective. And oh yes, ugly, too,
even with the drought tolerant plants . . .

Please don't do that on any other bike road. I live two doors from Bryant, and I don't want those awful things in my
neighborhood.

Please please reassess this work. These bulbouts are now forcing bikes to merge into cars ‐ this is a truly terrible idea ‐
I’ve already witnessed kids and cars getting extremely close at each intersection on Ross.

Why could you have not just paint a bike lane on one side of the street and restrict parking to the other side. That
would have been WAY cheaper, and WAY safer. The community is now at risk of a serious accident ‐ these things are
not helping they are encouraging worse driving behavior by people racing to get through the bulbouts before an
incoming vehicle does.

Terrible Idea ‐ on my block we are now organizing to make sure come voting time that responsible people are placed on
the council.

Hello,

Please stop the construction on Road Road. It has become dangerous for children biking to school and confusing for cars.

I would appreciate if you could take out the round about or at minimum make it smaller for safety along with taking out
the extension from the YMCA coming onto the road that are dangerous for strollers, someone with a walker and for
pedestrians. They all have to wait for the cars to go now. How sad!

Thank you.

Please reconsider the roundabouts and the other construction barriers. They are really confusing and they
narrow the roadway, which means cars, bicycles, and sometimes pedestrians are competing for narrow space. I
would also like to see the schools do some education on how to ride safely in that area. I am a frequent
pedestrian and driver on that road and most other roads in Palo Alto. Since bikes are riding in all the wrong
directions and on sidewalks, the likelihood of accidents has increased greatly. I'd also like to see greater
enforcement before something bad happens. Thank you.

Please write me back.

Dear City Council,

This morning I walked around the corner to Ramos Park to offer my support and gratitude for all the changes on
my street. One of the volunteers asked me to send my message on to all of you.

I bought my house on Ross 25 years ago and ever since we have wanted traffic calming. While I know that was
not the main focus of all the work, it has addressed my concerns. I raised two daughters on Ross, who both
walked or road their bikes to school. When they were in elementary school they used to take yellow duct tape
and write "SLOW DOWN" in the middle of Ross in front of our house.

I am sad that so many people seem to have strong negative opinions about the bike boulevard, without giving it
time to see how it works. I believe I was given information of the construction in advance, but I read my mail
and was predisposed to want the changes. These types of projects do require more visibility to help those who
struggle with change, but other than that you won't ever be able to make everyone happy.

I expect with time and education people will come to realize that cyclists and motorist are safer, being slowed
down by all the bulb outs, roundabouts and speed bumps.

Many thanks and hang in there!

The City is making it more dangerous to drive, bike or even walk. Check out the mess at the Y with the narrow in and
outs, bicycle riders moving out to the middle of the street to ride, and even talking about more table taking over
sidewalks in the downtown area. When I grew up you quickly learned the streets were for cars and to be careful, ride
you bike close to the curb, being careful and you were able to walk on the sidewalks without tables and chairs outside
restaurants (do they pay rent on our sidewalks), not to mention the dogs on leashes tied up to the legs of the tables.
Consider the safety of the majority of the people. In our super senior years it is becoming very scary to move around the
area.

Dear Council Members:

I live on the corner of Ross and Moreno and I can sit at my kitchen table and observe the traffic at the new
“roundabout.” I was the lone citizen that protested the first design contract (you might remember me, I was the first to
speak) for the project all those many years ago. I had about 10 reasons why the proposed plan was a bad idea. I got to
about reason 3 before I got yanked off the microphone, for the 50 or bicycle coalition folks (the spandex crowd) that
thought this was greatest idea since sliced bread. Almost none of these folks even live in Palo Alto, let alone have kids
that ride on Ross. Once the design contract was approved it was a done deal.

All those 10 reasons why this project is a bad design are still valid. You have by now probably heard all of them. To me
the most important one is that no one seems to know what problem was/is being solved. Ross worked fine. It certainly
does not fix our traffic problem. Kids were not being run down by cars. Who first said this is a GREAT IDEA? Are there
any measurable criteria to see if it accomplishes anything? Getting a few more bikes to ride on Ross is not success.

I will end with one story about what I observed about an hour ago. Remember I have a ringside seat to the
“roundabout”. This morning a lady with a stroller and a small child walking beside her came down Moreno going east on
the right sidewalk. She got to the corner and maneuvered the stroller and small child down over the high curb into the
traffic lane. She then proceeded to walk slowly in the traffic lane around the flower bed to the far corner. While she
was walking two cars came up behind her and were going slow enough to avoid hitting her. This could have had a far
different outcome. This is exactly why small traffic circles are dangerous. It is not obvious to pedestrians and bikers as
to how to use them. If you have to read the manual it is a fail.

I am not sure what you can do about the mess already built, but you can sure stop ripping up more of our streets for ill‐
defined and unmeasurable goals.

Subject:                               Small low-speed roundabouts increase bicycle accidents - why are we building them?



Since at least one member of the city council has said that they cannot read NextDoor, I'll repost here.
THE CITY OF PALO ALTO IS SPENDING MONEY MAKING OUR STREETS MORE DANGEROUS
FOR BICYCLISTS

I was somewhat relieved to see the city's announcement that they have heard the community's concerns and are willing to accept
outside expert advice on our experimental design. But I also noted that Granite Construction is building another mini-roundabout
with a raised island at the corner of Ross and Moreno, despite the community's near-universal rejection of the intersection at East
Meadow and Ross Road. There are many more of these mini-roundabout experiments planned in the city's bike boulevard project,
which is why it is so important that we stop and consider the results of the currently built intersections. Call me weak, but I decided
to spend $50 to buy the most recent research articles on bike safety in roundabouts (and yes, ours are not roundabouts -- they are
mini-roundabouts that violate the rule that all islands should be traversable). There is a study of 255 intersections in Denmark that
were converted to roundabouts, and surprisingly ... there is a 122% increase in bike accidents in 25-mph roundabouts. The danger is
even higher for small roundabouts (with islands smaller than 60-feet), and worse when the island is short (under 6-feet). So there is
no real way around the fact that the city is spending money making our streets more dangerous for our bicycle riders, especially our
young and inexperienced riders. I'll quote (since most of you will probably choose not to spend $50): "converting intersections to
roundabouts reduce the number of accidents and reduce accident severity. But the safety effects for cyclists are not so good. The
overall picture is that studies indicate that bicycle safety is worsened when intersections are converted to roundabouts. However,
intersection design, roundabout design and other characteristics of converted sites influence safety effects for cyclists and other road
users. This influence is considerable and safety effects in Table 1 should not be generalised due to excessive heterogeneity (Jensen,
2013)." Table 1 shows a 22% increase in bicycle accidents. The increase in bicycle accidents is especially high in lower-speed
intersections. Table 2 shows a 109% increase in bicycle accidents for intersections with a speed limit of 25 mph (40 kmh). Last but
not least, the report calls out small roundabouts as dangerous: "Brude and Larsson 1999a find that the accident rate for cyclists is
twice as high at small roundabouts, where the central island including truck aprons is less than 20m, compared to larger
roundabouts". Taken together, the city of Palo Alto has decided to embark on a construction experiment that essentially ensures
more bike accidents ... in pursuit of a more bike-friendly community. I really cannot wrap my mind around citing the reduction in
dangerous car accidents as the reason for spending $9.2 million to make our streets less safe for bikers. But that is what we have
done. The article is titled: Accident Analysis and Prevention Safe Roundabouts for Cyclists by Soren Underlien Jensen published

Subject:                         STILL too much jet noise after 3/29 ground track change



Dear Councilmembers,

As a resident of Skyline Blvd (not Palo Alto proper) I looked forward to the March 29 ground-track change
with great anticipation. While the noise problem has improved somewhat, the noise levels, frequency of
overflights and times of intrusive overflights remain quite high. In particular, I still hear frequent overflights
between the hours of 10pm and 1am.

I am somewhat baffled by the continuing frequent overflights; I would have expected that moving the ground
track to its old location would have displaced vectored flights commensurately, offering an immediate and
tangible difference to longsuffering residents who have been victimized by the SERFR STAR debacle. Instead,
I've noticed perhaps only a 30 percent drop in the unwelcome, frequent overflights that have punctuated my
working and sleeping hours for several years now.

I can only hope that the restoration of the ground track is a staged effort that is not yet complete, because
current noise levels are not even remotely close to the peace and quiet that currently affected neighborhoods
enjoyed for decades prior to the SERFR STAR change. When I purchased my home about 15 years ago, I heard
perhaps three flights per YEAR; now a "good" day is when I hear less than twenty per DAY. Even after the
March 29 change, I have experienced multiple days on which I reported over forty flights. Please note that these
numbers are artificially low because I have had to resort to wearing earplugs in order to sleep past 5:30 am...
this while reporting flights as late as 1 or 2 am from my cell phone in bed.

Guess what? You can't sleep when you have to wake up to report an overflight! But what choice do I have if I
want this problem to go away? DNR monitoring of noise is absolutely ineffective to the point of being ludicrous
- since the ground track change, I seem to hear MORE flights between 10pm and 1am. If someone thinks that's
OK, they need to rethink. Now.

I'd like to close with a big THANK YOU for your efforts to combat this most unwelcome intrusion, and to ask
you to pass along to the FAA that they need not pat themselves on the back too hard with regard to any of their
efforts to clean up the mess that they created SOLELY through a combination of colossal incompetence (really?
NO consideration of noise impact?) and stunning lack of consideration for the residents of Bay Area
communities.

Best Regards,

John Perry

To Palo Alto City Council Members:

I am writing to share with you that I have witnessed many distressing incidents at the intersection of East
Meadow and Ross Road. These “traffic calming measures” have proven to be extremely dangerous for all of us;
especially our children and the many elderly drivers in Palo Alto. Do any one of you actually care that this very
dangerous situation is ruining our neighborhoods and our quality of life?

STOP THE MADNESS!

Subject:                       survey on elder transportation



The resources of the elderly are diminished, but so are their transportation needs. No job means little
or no income, but also no daily commute. No car or inadequate vision means no garage and parking
needs. The problem is getting enough people together to maintain a car and hire a driver, which can
be done either by bringing in or sending out. For bringing in, some destination sends out a car,
minivan or bus, collects people from their home and brings them to the destination. For instance the
Palo Alto Medical Foundation might coordinate appointments so that everybody from South Palo Alto
would come on Monday adding in a drop-ff at the library and downtown, everybody from west Palo
Alto would come on Tuesday, and so forth. LaComida would pick up at various bus stops, the YMCA,
the library. The churches, also, could pick up worshippers. Lectures and seminars, especially paid
ones, could easily send out a car or van to pick up attendees.

The most efficient solution would be to gather together several hundred seniors and disabled adults
who do not drive, or do not have a car, or, at least don't need to use the car so frequently that they
need it nearby, in a very nice hotel with attractive landscaping,(( which would be a visual asset to any
neighborhood. Each person would have 200 square feet, comprising a bedroom and bath, with
shared amenities such as a pool, workshop, computer room, or gym, such as might be found in a
hotel, and, on the ground floor, compatible publicly accessible features such as a subsidized senior
nutrition program like La Comida, child care, elder care, a coffee shop.)) A van would be always
available to take residents to the train, the bus, or any nearby destination, and the cost, shared
among so many, would be negligible.
Stephanie Munoz.248-1842 101 Alma, Palo Alto

I am 85 and have had my driver's license suspended. I'd be glad to augment this with my
transportation experiences recently. The part describing the desirability of the hotel arrangement is, I
realize, superfluous for this transportation survey; I added it so as to show that this living arrangement
could be acceptable to well-to-do elderly downsizing from a luxury home, as well as to those priced
out of the market. The relevant information is the clustering to provide density which makes shared
transportation economically feasible. You are welcome to cut this as you like, or I can cut it if you
want. SM

Re: April 9, 2018, Special Meeting, Agenda Item 7

Dear Mayor Kniss, Vice Mayor Filseth, and City Council Members,

Thank you very much for listening to the community last night, for recognizing that policy changes are
necessary to preserve the most important values of our community, and for taking decisive action to begin to
address the housing crisis in Palo Alto.

1. You listened to the community.

As many speakers made clear during the public hearing, people throughout Palo Alto have suffered for many
years because too few homes have been built in Palo Alto that people of all income levels can afford.

2. You understood that actual change is necessary.

It has been nearly a decade since the Palo Alto City Council has approved a new affordable housing project.
You acknowledged that diversity of many kinds — including income diversity — is an important value in our
community, but you didn’t stop there. You did not rest after merely articulating that value. Instead, you went
on to acknowledge that something needed to be done to protect and to advance that value. You recognized that
current zoning laws have been overly restrictive and needed to be changed through concrete legislative
initiatives.

3. You took action.

Last night, by a 7-2 vote, you demonstrated that you truly care about the needs of all members of our
community. A strong majority of the City Council took the first steps to forge powerful new tools that will
allow Palo Alto Housing and other groups to build the broad range of more reasonably priced homes that
individuals and families throughout Palo Alto need.

On the 124th anniversary of Palo Alto’s incorporation, you celebrated some of the best parts of Palo Alto’s
heritage. As one speaker observed last night, in decades past Palo Alto has been recognized as a leader in
affordable housing. In the future, we can do even better. You demonstrated great leadership and courage by

doing more than simply saying that you support affordable housing: you took decisive action to begin to
actually address the housing crisis in Palo Alto.

Thank you very much for doing the right thing last night.

                   John Kelley

passing the Affordable Housing Overlay! As the housing shortage becomes more and more acute, your actions

120%AMI. Hoping this action leads to several 100% BMR project proposals in the coming months.

Many thanks again for making this happen!

affordability overlay, and took a bold action of making it a reality for our great city of Palo Alto. It’s a sweet victory of all
Palo Altoans who pride themselves as being progressive and compassionate.

This is an great first step towards making Palo Alto a place that promises inclusion and diversity.

I applauded your leadership and the desire to make a difference for our city. Hope is a wonderful thing.

Thank you!

Subject:                         Traffic analysis data



Josh-
On Friday it will have been four weeks since I requested the traffic analysis data for the intersection at East
Meadow Road and Ross Road, in writing and in person, required under contract from Alta Design. Specifically,
I asked you to provide data that was due from your former employer (under contract). To be precise, that data
is:

       Traffic data collection will be conducted by the CONSULT ANT upon approval by CITY, and is
       anticipated to include:
       • Seven days of vehicle speed and classification hose counts along each project route (up to 15
       locations)
       • Seven days of bicyclist and pedestrian counts using video including information on
       directionality, for each project, one coW'I.t will include approximate information regarding
       bicyclist type (age, gender, helmet use)‐ (up to 15 locations) ·
       • Where appropriate, intersection peak hour turning movement counts (up to 16 total)
My understanding from the California Public Records Act is that you should have provided this information to
me within ten business days. If you do not intend to provide this data, you must have a legal reason to support
your decision. Please let me know why you have not provided this data to me;.

My further understanding is that the outside expert analysis and review that was announced publicly two weeks
ago by Mr. De Gues (March 30th) is pending this same data. We are fortunate that an expert like Dr. Wei
Zhang from the Federal Highway Administration is willing to provide his input, and it is disappointing that you
cannot provide him the traffic analysis data and the engineering design from the newly built construction so that
he can help us address the safety issues that have resulted from this design. Since we all agree that safety is the
primary issue, and research shows that bicycle accidents increase when a small mini-roundabout at low traffic
speeds replaces an intersection with four stop signs, this truly is a matter of urgency. You are on record as
believing that this mini-roundabout with a raised island conforms to engineering design standards (against all
printed guidelines), where many parents (856 and counting) believe it is dangerous -- it is critical that this
data be shared as soon as possible. Please let me know when this data will be made available to me and to the
FHWA expert, or explain the delay.

My children ride through this intersection twice every day, and my concern and my interest have not faded in
the least with the announcement that we are slowing down further construction. I care a great deal about the
dangerous interaction between cars and bikes at the intersection of East Meadow and Ross Roads.

Since the new construction (concrete experiment that does NOT conform to mini-roundabout guidelines) at
Moreno and Ross is continuing, I expect you will find another 800 unhappy Ohlone parents with this new
danger to their commuting children (unsafe experiments masquerading as mini-roundabouts). The city council
WILL hear residents disappointment, now or at the next election. Choose to be on the right side of that vote

(stop digging, redesign these unsafe intersections), and ensure our children are safe riding their bikes to school
every day. 44% of 12,000 kids is 5,000 kids on bikes every day. Do NOT let the parents of Palo Alto down.

So really, when can we get the data?

The new proposed water rates are out of hand. Shall we start using water again so the rate doesn't go
up? Thank you Councilman Sharff for your concern. Our Palo Alto rates use to be the best around but it
seems that they are higher than PGE. Stop with all the increases!!!!!!!!!

Dear City Council,

I found that there is a Wilton court project with a very limited parting. I as a resident of Palo Alto would urge the city to
raise the parking numbers of the project. My family go to Hong Kong Restaurant at Wilton and always have trouble to
find parking. A new project with limited parking makes the street more crowded and unsafe. Kids won’t bike safely
around the town.

So pls ask the developer to add more parking spots. It’s unfair to put the pressure to Wilton resident to take the traffic
jam.

My remarks of last night follow.
‐Fred Balin 4/10/18

Good evening,

Three weeks ago, at the zoning‐code‐update continuation, here, with five councilmembers present, this body clarified
that contextual placement of covered parking on an R‐1 lot applies to carports as well as garages.

Three years prior, in 2015, Planning Commissioner Michael Alcheck, successfully utilized that ambiguity to convince the
city to permit him to build carports in the front of two lots in which he had a material, financial interest.

Somehow in this exception process:

‐ The city allowed him to build, what the existing code and any reasonable person would see, were garages without car
doors.

‐ The city failed to recognize or inform, that their permission to allow the demolition of a garage in the rear of each lot to
be replaced with a parking structure in the front, would, in fact, flip, … flip the predominant context of covered parking
on each block from “rear" to “front”.

‐ And the city failed to bring forth an ordinance in a timely manner to prevent Commissioner Alcheck from fully enclosing
these parking structures as garages, and with it, a significant financial gain.

Just as the council, three weeks ago, began a process to prevent this occurrence in the future, so could have the
Planning & Transportation Commission when staff brought forth its clarifications to close the carport‐in‐the‐front
loophole.

First, in 2015, with his projects just starting, when Commissioner Alcheck, neither disclosed the nature of his interest or
recused himself, but rather participated and successfully pushed discussion of the item off the table.

And then last year, when no permit had been issued for his application to convert each carport to a garage, he neither
disclosed his interest nor recused himself from the commission hearings.

With all due respect to the city attorney, residents looking into this, see these as both legal and ethical violations. And so
we continue to seek out and receive new information, including via public records, and to assess it, to further flesh out
and clarify the points at issue.

This is not a minor matter, nor one that can successfully be pushed under the rug.

We again ask that you take appropriate action.
Thank you.

Comment on Potential Litigation:

Residents of Palo Alto are facing "death by increments" as a result of
failure to challenge the Environmental Assessment for the FAA's 2014
NextGen project. By not challenging that 2014 EA, impacts allowed at
that time become the baseline for further changes by FAA, and
adjustments to flight procedures will be justified by the FAA as "no big
change" or "no impact".

To quote from the Southern California cities' Petition for Review, the
FAA is at fault in "failing and refusing to include in its purported
"cumulative impact" analysis the numerous "past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable" future projects "

Without accurate assessment of environmental impacts to provide
an acceptable baseline for future procedures, there is no way for
FAA to measure or consider the consequences of their actions, or
provide justification for less harmful alternatives.

The goal of mitigation efforts should be to ensure that absolute levels of
aircraft noise and frequency of noise disturbances are reduced to or
below an agreed upon historical baseline. Two years ago 6 Peninsula
cities wrote to Representatives Eshoo and Farr to ask that 2006 be the
baseline for FAA actions. Even before NextGen changes started to
impact many Bay Area communities in early 2015, earlier changes by
the FAA to air traffic practices began impacting some communities well
before then. Given improvements in aircraft and navigation systems
since 2006 it should be possible to reduce aircraft noise below 2006
levels. Accurate flight data exist back to 2006 for noise modeling
purposes.

Do not let Palo Alto be the boiled frog in the escalating heat of FAA
procedures. Take legal action now to protect Palo Alto's future.

Closed Session - potential litigation April 9, 201

Dear Council Members,

My name is Marie-Jo Fremont, a Palo Alto resident since 1993.

Thank you for taking the time to hold a closed session to discuss
potential litigation in regards to airplane noise.

Litigation is indeed a tool that our City should be ready to use if
necessary. It is an additional mechanism to pressure the FAA to solve
the severe noise problem they created when they deployed NextGen
without taking into account the people living on the ground.

Why consider litigation? 3 reasons:

•   It matters. Litigation is something that the FAA pays attention to.
• Cities who have filed seem to be getting results (for instance,
  Newport Beach, Burien, Phoenix). In contrast, after almost 2 years
  since the Select Committee was created, the FAA has not endorsed
  or offered any solution that will substantially reduce noise for
  residents living near the MENLO waypoint.
• Cities are much more powerful than individual residents, especially
  when Cities join forces. Some Portola Valley residents lost the only
  lawsuit that was filed against the FAA in our area. They did the best
  they could under the 60-day FAA deadline. Things have also
  changed. Multiple cities are also exploring possible litigation
  (Pacifica, Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay). Palo Alto is not alone.

You must be ready to act if necessary. Easier said than done given
that filing must occur within 60 days of the FAA implementing a
change. Miss the deadline and the court will reject the claim -this just
occurred for the Citizen's Association of Georgetown.

During that 60-day window, one needs to detect the change, validate
it, quickly assess its impact, and then file. Multiple non-legal things
must happen before Legal can file. I call this the qualification phase.
Staff must be leading that part to prepare the grounds for the Legal
team to act if necessary.

Thank you again for all your efforts.
